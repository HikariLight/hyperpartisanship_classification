{"text":"The Crazy Republican-Endorsed Logic Behind \u201cIf Trump Loses, I\u2019m Grabbing My Musket.\u201d: Photo by Scott Olson\/Getty Images A man (not Joe Walsh) points a rifle at a gun show. The Republican Party has embraced the \u201cinsurrectionist\u201d theory of the Second Amendment, which holds that individuals should violently overthrow an overly oppressive government using firearms. Former Republican Congressman and Tea Party darling Joe Walsh took to Twitter on Wednesday to announce his post-election day plans. \u201cOn November 9th,\u201d he wrote, \u201cif Trump loses, I\u2019m grabbing my musket. You in?\u201d  On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump.On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket.You in?\u2014 Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016  Walsh frequently says horrific things on Twitter, and it may be tempting to write off this latest proclamation as his standard fevered lunacy. But as I noted in August, this sentiment\u2014that a Donald Trump loss might justify the violent overthrow of a Hillary Clinton administration\u2014is really just the logical endpoint of a longtime GOP talking point. The National Rifle Association has longed peddled the \u201cinsurrectionist\u201d theory of the Second Amendment, arguing that the right to bear arms was intended to protect citizens against a tyrannical ruler. According to this theory, individuals must have access to firearms in order to revolt against an overly oppressive government. The purpose of the amendment, then, isn\u2019t merely self-defense, but a right to assassinate a leader who unduly restricts liberty. Although this insurrectionist theory is entirely made up and utterly foreign to the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Second Amendment, it has gained a foothold in the Republican Party. In 2010, Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle suggested that Nevadans might use \u201cSecond Amendment remedies\u201d to punish an overly liberal Congress. In 2014, Iowa Republican (and current senator) Jodi Ernst proclaimed that she had a right to defend herself and her family \u201cfrom the government, should they decide that my rights are no longer important.\u201d During his campaign for the presidential nomination, Texas Republican Ted Cruz asserted that the Second Amendment provides \u201ca Constitutional right to protect your children, your family, your home, our lives, and to serve as the ultimate check against governmental tyranny\u2014for the protection of liberty.\u201d And of course, in August, Donald Trump implied that \u201cSecond Amendment people\u201d might murder Hillary Clinton should she appoint liberal Supreme Court justices. Given the GOP\u2019s embrace of the insurrectionist theory, Walsh\u2019s statement should not be at all shocking. In a follow-up tweet, he clarified that he was encouraging \u201cprotesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back.\u201d Under his party\u2019s view of the Second Amendment, \u201cdoing what it takes to get our country back\u201d includes assassinating political leaders whom one deems to be oppressive. Oppression, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. And the GOP has already primed its supporters to fight back against whatever oppression Hillary Clinton might bring\u2014muskets at the ready.","label":1}
{"text":"Review of 650,000 Emails in Weiner\u2019s Laptop for Potential Clinton Ties Could Take Weeks: Justin Sullivan\/Getty Images Hillary Clinton speaks during a campaign rally at Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park on October 26, 2016 in Tampa, Florida. The FBI is getting ready to analyze around 650,000 emails that are in the laptop of disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner to see whether any of them have any relation to a previous investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private server. \u201cMetadata on the device suggests there may be thousands sent to or from the private server that the Democratic nominee used while she was secretary of state,\u201d reports the Wall Street Journal, citing \u201cpeople familiar with the matter.\u201d The probe, which was apparently delayed because agents had to wait for a court order, is expected to take weeks at least. That means that if Clinton wins the election, she will be celebrating with a cloud over her head as the FBI will at least be investigating some of her closest advisers. The warrant to begin searching the emails has been obtained, the New York Times reports. \u201cThe process has begun,\u201d a federal law enforcement official said. But the Times notes that law enforcement officials have said \u201cthere was no chance the email review could be completed before Election Day.\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign did not wait long to blast the Wall Street Journal story, highlighting that it says the emails \u201cmay\u201d be related to the previous investigation into the private server. \u201cThese are misleading leaks from the FBI and its shameless,\u201d Clinton campaign press secretary Brian Fallon wrote on Twitter. Indeed, the Journal piece notes that first investigators have to determine whether any of the emails are between Clinton aide Huma Abedin, Weiner\u2019s estranged wife, and State Department officials, then whether they contain classified material, and then whether any of them are duplicates of emails that have already been reviewed. It seems to be increasingly clear that while FBI Director James Comey only learned about the existence of these potentially relevant emails recently, investigators knew for weeks, according to several reports. That is significant because if the news had been revealed earlier it \u201cmight have been less politicall damaging for Clinton,\u201d notes the Washington Post, which also points out that it isn\u2019t clear \u201cwhat agents have been doing in the intervening time.\u201d Abedin, meanwhile, is a bit at a loss as to how her emails would have ended up in Weiner\u2019s computer, according to the Post. Abedin didn\u2019t regularly use that computer and apparently her lawyers never even searched through it because they didn\u2019t think any messages coud be in there. An investigator tells the Associated Press that it was \"news to [Abedin]\" that her emails would be in her husband's computer.","label":0}
{"text":"Trump\u2019s Astounding, Hypocritical Cruelty Peaks With Alicia Machado \u201cSex Tape\u201d Tweet: Jewel Samad\/AFP\/Getty Images Childish, mean-spirited bully Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Bedford, New Hampshire, on September 29, 2016. Donald Trump has the biggest platform of any out-of-control bully in the world right now. This week, he\u2019s using it to try and destroy former Miss Universe contestant Alicia Machado, who\u2019s spoken out about how Trump mistreated and humiliated her when she gained weight after winning the crown. Trump has been ranting nonstop about Machado since Hillary Clinton brought her up in Monday\u2019s presidential debate. (Afterward, her campaign released a Spanish-language video of Machado telling her story.) She did gain a lot of weight, he whined, and that\u2019s a \u201c real problem\u201d! He hinted to the media and his Twitter audience that Machado had some kind of checkered past that would scandalize us. Finally, awake and fuming in the wee hours of Friday morning, Trump couldn\u2019t take it anymore. In a 5:30 a.m. tweet, he beseeched America to \u201c check out sex tape.\u201d The alleged \u201csex tape\u201d is not a sex tape at all. It\u2019s a night-vision clip from La Granja, a Spanish Big Brother\u2013esque reality program, that appears to show Machado having sex with a man. The clip, from 2005, shows no nudity; both Machado and her partner are covered by sheets. It\u2019s similar to a hundred scenes that have aired on Big Brother, Jersey Shore, or The Real World. Though the clip has been available for a decade, it\u2019s safe to say that few people knew or cared about it until the Trump campaign thrust it into the political news cycle. Today, the world is dissecting it. The abject cruelty and cynicism of this move is staggering. Machado isn\u2019t running for political office; there\u2019s no reason for Trump to attack her for something unrelated to her claims against him. He\u2019s trying to besmirch her character as if it were relevant, as if she were his opponent. Her appearance on a sexy reality show has no bearing on her Miss Universe story, yet he\u2019s acting as if this video clip invalidates it. Hillary did not present her as an \u201cangel\u201d or \u201cparagon of virtue,\u201d as Trump tweeted. She presented Machado as a regular woman who was bullied mercilessly by an entitled, insecure man who gets off on putting women down. One need not be \u201c Mother Teresa\u201d to deserve better than Trump\u2019s abuse. Having sex on a reality show is nothing to be ashamed about. But Trump\u2019s use of this clip as a weapon against her character\u2014her reliability, her capacity to inspire sympathy, her deserving of kind treatment\u2014is callous and low. It\u2019s also extraordinarily hypocritical. Trump is forever bragging about the hotness of his own wives and sexual conquests, and he\u2019s applauded Melania\u2019s success as a model when confronted with her own nude photo shoots. He\u2019s watched Paris Hilton\u2019s sex tape and commended her for being jaw-droppingly hot at age 12. He proudly recalls his own adultery while telling us that Machado\u2019s sex is something to shame\u2014\u201cdisgusting,\u201d he called her in his tweet. Machado, all power to her, is taking Trump\u2019s infantile harassment in stride. In an Instagram post on Friday morning, she scolded him for his attacks. \u201cIn the middle of his campaign of hate, the Republican candidate insists on discrediting and demoralizing a woman, that is definitely one of his most frightening characteristics,\u201d she wrote in Spanish. \u201cWith this, he\u2019s looking to distract the attention from his real problems and from his inability to pretend to be the leader of this great nation.\u201d She goes on to reaffirm her support for Clinton and promise to continue speaking out for women and Latinos. Like Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the Muslim American couple who endured a similar round of senseless public abuse at Trump\u2019s hands, Machado is giving Trump and his team a basic lesson in decency and political PR. Trump\u2019s capacity for no-holds-barred shaming of anyone and everyone should give voters cause for deep concern. Even worse, perhaps, is the fact that he can\u2019t stop himself from bullying people even when it\u2019s not in his political interest. His feuds with the Khans and Machado make him look like a cartoonish mob boss seeking sadistic revenge on anyone with less political power than he has. Trump cannot stop punching down until he\u2019s launched every low blow he can dream up. As Clinton tweeted on Friday morning, that\u2019s simply not an appropriate disposition for a president.  What kind of man stays up all night to smear a woman with lies and conspiracy theories?\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 30, 2016   When something gets under Donald's thin skin, he lashes out and can't let go. This is dangerous for a president.\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 30, 2016   Trump obsessively bullies Rosie O'Donnell\u2014an accomplished actor. He insulted Kim Kardashian for her weight\u2014when she was pregnant. Pathetic.\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 30, 2016  In previous elections, Trump\u2019s brand of mean-spirited smears might have been outsourced to shady PACs and third-level surrogates, leaving the candidate to rise above the messy fracas. Surely, that\u2019s what the GOP would prefer. But party leaders only have themselves to blame for the anger, conspiracy theories, and racist panic that\u2019s led to Trump\u2019s rise; they deserve whatever bad press Trump earns for them with his extended temper tantrum. Alicia Machado does not.","label":1}
{"text":"Max Boot: Republicans have Stockholm Syndrome and it\u2019s getting worse: President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Governor Ricardo Rossello of Puerto Rico in the Oval Office of the White House, Thursday, Oct. 19, 2017, in Washington. (AP Photo\/Evan Vucci) The lobotomization of the Republican Party appeared complete last year when the same GOP paladins who had denounced Donald Trump as a \u201clunatic trying to get ahold of nuclear weapons\u201d (Marco Rubio), as a bigot who was guilty of \u201cthe textbook definition of a racist comment\u201d (Paul Ryan), and as a \u201cnarcissist,\u201d \u201cserial philanderer,\u201d \u201cpathological liar,\u201d and \u201cbully\u201d (Ted Cruz) nevertheless endorsed him for the most powerful position in the world. Tragedy turned to farce (or is it the other way around?) after the emergence of the \u201cgrab \u2018em by the pussy\u201d tape on October 7, 2016. Republicans such as Sens. John Thune, Mike Crapo and Deb Fischer called for Trump to leave the race on the grounds that he was unfit for office, only to change their minds and re-endorse him when it became evident that he was still polling strongly among base voters. But the Republicans\u2019 race to the bottom \u2014 to the absolute lowest moral and intellectual depths \u2014 wasn\u2019t over last year, and it\u2019s not over now. It\u2019s still continuing, with even supposedly \u201cnormal,\u201d \u201cmoderate,\u201d \u201cmainstream\u201d Republicans increasingly echoing Trump\u2019s know-nothing effusions. In Virginia, Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman and counselor to \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d George W. Bush, is attacking his Democratic opponent for governor, Ralph Northam, for being too sympathetic to immigrants and too unsympathetic to Confederate monuments. One particularly incendiary commercial accuses Northam of \u201cincreasing the threat of MS-13,\u201d a drug gang from El Salvador that is evoked with pictures of tattooed gang-bangers who actually belong to a rival outfit. Gillespie\u2019s tendentious reasoning? Northam voted against a bill in Congress that would have prohibited the establishment of any \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d even though Virginia does not have any such cities. MS-13 has long been a favorite Trump target, symbolizing the supposed menace of Latino immigration. The current chair of the RNC, Ronna Romney McDaniel, has been equally eager to serve as a Trump echo chamber. Her Twitter feed gives sycophancy a bad name. Recent tweets: \u201cNo one recognizes the importance of women\u2019s empowerment better than @IvankaTrump. She\u2019s paving the way worldwide\u201d; \u201cWonderful to finally have a @POTUS who isn\u2019t ashamed to stand up for religious liberties\u201d; and \u201cRatings for unpatriotic NFL declining? Shocked.\u201d If Trump claimed the moon was made of Swiss cheese, McDaniel would be mocking anyone who said it was actually Camembert. In her willingness to serve as a Trump enabler, McDaniel is matched, and perhaps exceeded, by the senior-most Republican officials in the land. Who can forget Vice President Mike Pence going to the Colts-49ers game on Oct. 8 for the express purpose of walking out to express disapproval of players kneeling during the national anthem? Trump has fixated on this non-issue as a way to mobilize his white, working-class base by anathematizing wealthy African-American athletes. And Pence is happy to play along. Just as House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is happy to vouch for Trump as a non-racist despite decades of Archie Bunker-style comments suggesting otherwise. \u201cHis heart\u2019s in the right place,\u201d Ryan said, making one wonder whether he has access to a super-secret EKG. The leaders of Congress seem to be suffering from Stockholm Syndrome, which by now should really be renamed Republican Syndrome. There, on Monday, was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell singing kumbaya with Trump in the White House Rose Garden only hours after the president disavowed any blame for \u201cnot getting the job done\u201d legislatively. \u201cI\u2019m not gong to blame myself, I\u2019ll be honest,\u201d Trump said. (When has he ever blamed himself for anything?) \u201cThey\u2019re not getting the job done.\u201d In case there is any doubt about who \u201cthey\u201d is, Trump has been explicit in calling out McConnell as a weak leader, tweeting in August, \u201cThe only problem I have with Mitch McConnell is that, after hearing Repeal  ; Replace for 7 years, he failed!\u201d McConnell nevertheless pledged fealty to his abuser. \u201cContrary to what some of you may have reported,\u201d he dutifully intoned, \u201cwe are together totally on this agenda to move America forward.\u201d The excuse for this craven behavior is that all qualms about Trump - the least presidential president in the whole history of this republic, or any other - must be subordinated to the Republican policy agenda. You know, the agenda that Trump is not actually passing. This GOP attitude was taken to its logical if laughable extreme when Sen. Rob Portman, another supposed Republican adult, was asked about the victory in Alabama\u2019s Senate special election primary of far-right rabble-rouser Roy Moore, who makes Trump seem wonkish by comparison. Portman\u2019s only response? \u201cHe\u2019s going to be for tax reform, I think.\u201d Never mind about the Constitution, which Moore and Trump both seek to shred in their own ways \u2014 Moore is opposed to the separation of church and state, Trump to the freedom of the press. (He thinks that \u201cit is frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write.\u201d) As long as they\u2019re for tax cuts, we\u2019re all good! There are, to be sure, a few honorable exceptions \u2014 prominent Republicans who are willing to speak the truth about the naked emperor \u2014 but they are a miniscule minority in a nation in which their party dominates every branch of government. One of the most prominent truth-tellers is Sen. John McCain, who voted against the abomination that Republican leaders slapped together at the last minute to make good on Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d ObamaCare. Receiving the Liberty Medal at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, McCain gave a typically courageous, clear-eyed speech Monday in which he denounced Trumpism root and branch. \u201cTo fear the world we have organized and led for three-quarters of a century,\u201d he said, \u201cto abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain \u2018the last best hope of earth\u2019 for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history.\u201d But then McCain has long been a \u201cmaverick\u201d distrusted by the same rank-and-file Republicans who now eagerly embrace Trump, his opposite in every respect. McCain\u2019s fellow senator from Arizona, Jeff Flake, also has been outspoken in denouncing Trump. \u201cWe pretended the emperor wasn\u2019t naked,\u201d he wrote in his recent book, Conscience of a Conservative. \u201cEven worse: We checked our critical faculties at the door and pretended that the emperor was making sense.\u201d Flake\u2019s reward for his truth-telling? He is in danger of losing next year\u2019s primary to the odious Kelli Ward, an overly eager office-seeker who, following McCain\u2019s diagnosis of brain cancer this summer, immediately called on him to quit the Senate so that the governor could appoint her in his place. Civilized conduct is not only unnecessary in today\u2019s GOP, it is actually distrusted as the sign of a \u201cRINO (Republican in Name Only) cuck.\u201d Sen. Bob Corker, one of Trump\u2019s initial establishment enablers, has recently taken to telling the truth about the president, but only because he has decided not to seek re-election. The reaction to Corker\u2019s comments \u2014 he said that Trump is treating the presidency like a \u201creality show,\u201d that his aides are desperately trying to \u201ccontain him,\u201d and that he is setting us on \u201cthe path to World War III\u201d \u2014 has been telling. Other Republicans aren\u2019t stepping forward to disagree, and Corker says that virtually all of his fellow Republican senators agree with him. But instead of saying in public what they say in private, these invertebrate officeholders try to change the subject or simply refuse to comment. They are a profile in cowardice, these Republicans, and they are making a mockery of their oaths to \u201csupport and defend the Constitution.\u201d If they truly believe that Trump is not fit for office, then they have an obligation to impeach and remove him. Instead they choose to act as if Trump is their partner in governing. In the process, the entire Republican Party is making itself ever-more complicit in Trump\u2019s crimes \u2014 which range from offenses against good sense, rationality and common decency to, perhaps, actual violations of the law such as obstruction of justice. It becomes ever harder to disagree with the verdict of foreign-policy sage Robert Kagan, like me an erstwhile Republican, who writes that the GOP in its current form is doomed and that Republicans who cannot stomach Trumpism \u201cshould change their registration and start voting for Democratic moderates and centrists, as some Republicans did in Virginia recently, to give them a leg up in their fight against the party\u2019s left wing.\u201d This is truly Trump\u2019s party, and that leaves me to root for Democrats to win a landslide victory in the midterm elections next fall. I have my differences with many Democratic candidates, but on the most important issue facing our nation \u2014 whether Trump is fit for office \u2014 they are right and Republicans are a disgrace.

{"text":"GOP must denounce Trump for embrace of white supremacists: Donald Trump has dropped all pretense and proudly raised the banner of white racial grievance. The time has come for Republicans in Congress to decide whether this is what they signed up for. Business leaders decided that they'd had enough, quitting two presidential advisory councils before Trump quickly dissolved the panels. Military leaders made their call as well, issuing statements \u2013 in the wake of Charlottesville \u2013 making clear they embrace diversity and reject bigotry. With only a few exceptions, however, GOP political leaders have been too timid to denounce the president and the reprehensible game of racial politics he's playing. I think the corporate chief executives who bailed are making the right bet: History will remember who spoke out, who was complicit, and who stood idly by.  300x250 image ad On Twitter (where else?) Trump poured salt in the nation's wounds by coming out firmly against the removal of public monuments to the Confederacy \u2013 the issue that brought white supremacists, neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan to Charlottesville and led to the death of Heather Heyer. \"Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments,\" he wrote. \"You can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson \u2013 who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!\" Trump can't possibly be so dense that he doesn't see a clear distinction between the men who founded this nation and those who tried to rip it apart. Trump may indeed not know that most of those Confederate monuments were erected not in the years right after the Civil War but around the turn of the 20th century, when the Jim Crow system of state-enforced racial oppression was being established. They symbolize not history but the defiance of history; they celebrate not defeat on the battlefield but victory in putting uppity African Americans back in their place. For Trump, the important thing is to tell the white voters who constitute his base that they are being disrespected and dispossessed. It's a cynical and dangerous ploy. We know this is Trump's game because White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon told us so. In an interview with journalist Robert Kuttner of The American Prospect, Bannon is quoted as saying: \"The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got 'em. I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\" But Trump's base won't identify with Nazis and the KKK. That's why Trump maintained \u2013 falsely \u2013 that among the torch-bearing Charlottesville white supremacists there were also plenty of \"nice people.\" That's probably also why Bannon, in the interview with Kuttner, referred to the white-power clowns as, well, \"clowns.\" He's smart enough to reassure Trump supporters that they're not like those racists and that all the racial game-playing is on the other side. Trump's desperation is palpable. His approval ratings have slid perilously close to the danger zone where Republican officeholders no longer fear crossing him. For titans of the business community, the chief executives of such companies as General Electric, Campbell Soup, Johnson  ; Johnson and 3M decided they could no longer serve on Trump's advisory Manufacturing Council or his Strategy  ; Policy Forum. Prospects that Trump can actually follow through on a business-friendly agenda, including tax reform, look increasingly dim. And Trump's \"many sides\" reaction to Charlottesville wasn't going over at all well with employees, customers or the executives themselves. \"Constructive economic and regulatory policies are not enough and will not matter if we do not address the divisions in our country,\" JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon wrote in a message to his employees. The chiefs of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and National Guard also publicly condemned hate groups in the wake of Charlottesville. They, of course, could not mention the commander in chief by name. But politicians can. And they must.","label":1}
{"text":"Liberals Outraged Over Photo of Illegals in Cages. There\u2019s Only One Problem\u2026: Photos of detained illegal immigrants in cage-like cells went viral this weekend. Liberals were all too quick to spread this shocking photograph, as proof of President Donald Trump\u2019s cruelty. But their incredible blunder just backfired. Now, they\u2019re screwed. Is there nothing the left won\u2019t do to slander President Donald Trump? The answer, of course, is a resounding no. Democrats will do anything to undermine the president\u2019s work. That includes being as underhanded, manipulative, and cruel as possible. Also, being as dishonest as a snake. Over the course of Trump\u2019s time in office, we\u2019ve seen liberals do some shockingly terrible things. They\u2019ve insulted his wife by criticizing her intelligence, country of origin, and even her accent, proving who the real racists and sexists are. They\u2019ve attacked Trump\u2019s family, including his young son. Liberals didn\u2019t hesitate to question his children\u2019s mental health, even calling Barron handicapped. That\u2019s not even mentioning the numerous times that left-wing outlets edited videos or photos to make Trump look like a bad guy. But what they did this weekend really takes the cake. A photo went viral across Twitter. The ugly picture depicted detained illegal immigrants. These people \u2014 arrested by our government \u2014 were forced to stay in cages resembling dog kennels. Liberals, as you can imagine, were beside themselves, attacking Trump for an obvious act of cruelty and evil. It\u2019s too bad that these liberals didn\u2019t bother to check the date on the picture.  Ex-Obama staffer Jon Favreau, in a now-deleted tweet, linked to an AZCentral.com article titled, \u201cFirst glimpse of immigrant children at holding facility\u201d and said \u201cThis is happening right now, and the only debate that matter is how we force our government to get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible.\u201d His obvious intent was to slam the Trump administration for its treatment of unaccompanied minors taken into custody at the border. [Source: Twitchy]  Jon Favreau was one of many liberals who attacked Trump over this injustice. The famed Hollywood actor and director once worked for Obama as his speechwriter. So I guess he knew how better things were under the last administration, right? This liberal celebrity is probably horrified every day over what he sees coming from the White House. I mean, who could allow something as evil as this: Screenshot of Favreau\u2019s now-deleted tweet. Liberals across the spectrum of stupid chimed in with their condemnations of President Donald Trump.

What vicious, vile cruelty against innocent illegals. Surely the man responsible for this is a total racist, who hates brown people. Liberals have every right to spread this photograph to as many people as possible. But wait, let\u2019s look at the original article. It was from ACCentral.com. According to the date, this was written in 2014. That\u2019s right, liberals. This photograph you\u2019re all so outraged over was taken during Obama\u2019s administration. This \u201cbombshell\u201d story came out four years ago. Yet, for some reason, nobody was outraged. Liberals weren\u2019t storming Twitter with demands for change. They weren\u2019t calling Obama racist for treating children like this. Why weren\u2019t the overlords within the mainstream media demanding answers from his administration? Seems like liberals didn\u2019t really care when Obama mistreated illegals. Yet they daily accuse Trump of racism, based on nothing. All Trump wants to do is protect our border from crime and terrorism. He\u2019s not treating illegals like animals. But while Trump calls vile MS-13 members \u201canimals,\u201d Obama was treating children like animals. Really makes you think. Liberals, in their feverish hatred for Trump, unwittingly outed one of Obama\u2019s many sins. And their own. You see, they don\u2019t give a damn about illegal immigrants. They pretend to care, as a response to Trump\u2019s stance on immigration. Before Trump proposed the wall, liberals didn\u2019t think twice about illegals. We know that for a fact because this article has been around for FOUR YEARS, and they\u2019ve said nothing. They dishonestly tried to pass this off as current, only for it to blow up in their faces. Any response liberals? Are you going to denounce the absolute evil committed under Obama\u2019s watch? Source: madworldnews.com","label":1}

Mit dieser Begr\u00fc\u00dfung beginnt ein Video, das den US-W\u00e4hlern Hillary Clinton madig machen soll.

Die \"Berliner Morgenpost\" hatte zuerst dar\u00fcber berichtet.

{"text":"Who Are \u2018The People\u2019 Anyway?: Bill Kristol and Sean Hannity CreativeCommonsFlickr\/GageSkidmore andLeonardZhukovsky\/Shutterstock&amp;gt; Every time I listen to Sean Hannity or some other Trump-enthusiast stressing the \u201cmission\u201d for which our president was elected, I hear flattering references to \u201cthe people.\u201d Mind you, I\u2019m not against populist tropes being used to execute an end-run around the likes of Hillary Clinton or Nancy Pelosi. Moreover, I\u2019ve never pretended to be a \u201cNever-Trump\u201d establishment Republican. My endorsement of Trump during last year\u2019s presidential campaign is too much a matter of record to be credibly denied. But the endless appeals to \u201cthe people\u201d have begun to wear on me. Trump\u2019s core constituency covers about 39 percent of prospective voters; and this raises certain questions about whether this percentage is coextensive with the entire \u201cpeople.\u201d Do the 4 out of 10 college students who would silence \u201chate speech\u201d (that is speech from the Right) belong to \u201cthe people\u201d? Do the 60 percent of those polled in a recent CNN survey who disapprove of Trump\u2019s criticism of NFL players who took to their knees during the playing of the Star Spangled Banner, belong to this mystical whole known as \u201cthe people\u201d? What about the more than 60 million individuals who gave their votes to Clinton in our most recent presidential election? Do these voters belong to \u201cthe people\u201d? If not, why not? I\u2019m asking these questions because I\u2019d like to know how 39 percent of the voting public can become all of \u201cthe people.\u201d I asked myself a similar question as I read The Revolt of the Elites by Christopher Lasch\u2014 a work that tries to dissociate \u201cthe people\u201d from the vile, transnational \u201coverclass\u201d that Lasch blames for the decline of the family and a traditional sense of community. Lasch studiously ignores a major reason that the entertainers, authors, and other celebrities whom he deprecates have done so remarkably well. It\u2019s because \u201cthe people\u201d adore them and their cultural products and have made them what they are. Without Lasch\u2019s \u201cpeople,\u201d the overclass that he despises would not be prospering. Non-leftist populists have certain groups in mind when they use their conjuring term, just as Democrats do when they refer to grievance-bearing lifestyle and racial minorities as \u201cthe people.\u201d Lasch, a defender of settled communities, typically holds up as his paradigm a mid-twentieth century working-class family, featuring very traditional gender roles. Lasch\u2019s ideal mommy packs a lunch pail for his ideal blue-collar dad, who goes off to work in a factory. This is also the image of the populist family that comes to mind when Pat Buchanan tells us about the declining rustbelt and about all of the jobs that have fled from our blue-collar communities to Third World countries. Unlike Buchanan\u2014who is linked to the Old Right\u2014Lasch was considered to be a part of the socialist Left during his lifetime. And yet, the two figures are rhetorically and often programmatically indistinguishable. Both would now exemplify a populism of the Right, combining demands for the protection of the indigenous workforce with fond images of a disappearing America. Since I can easily identify with these images, I am noting this regretfully. By contrast, most of those who I hear celebrating Trumpian populism\u2014like Sean Hannity and Newt Gingrich on Fox News\u2014are not about to restore \u201cthe people\u201d as they used to be, or at least how they were perceived to be. After all, cohesive societies with traditional gender and family roles that right-wing populists once took for granted are now much weaker than they once were. The last thing that our would-be populists would want to do is face the rage of LGBT and feminist activists on the social Left, and the unavoidable media outrage. Our self-advertised populists do not therefore attempt to take us back to mid-twentieth century communities, lest they be accused of praising the bad old times. In any case, Trumpian populists have different priorities. For example, Hannity and other pundits on Fox News want to mobilize their viewers against the Democrats and in favor of Republican political candidates. Although they occasionally criticize the GOP for not being up to speed, they then go on to hammer the Democrats for not caring about \u201cthe people.\u201d We are urged to help \u201cour president\u201d fulfill the people\u2019s will by voting for Republicans at every level. Reading Breitbart, one gets the impression that their staff\u2019s understanding of populism is simply to support Trump at every turn, except when Steve Bannon decides to break ranks (such as on DACA). Other Trumpian populist websites, such as American Greatness and a more recent arrival, American Affairs, often look like what one might expect to find on other websites bearing a conservative label. Both feature conventional neoconservative names on their mastheads, but they also showcase representatives of a West Coast movement descended derivatively from the German political theorist Leo Strauss. These would-be populists were disciples of Strauss\u2019s student, the late Harry Jaffa, or in some cases of Jaffa\u2019s student Charles Kesler at Claremont University, and are promoting their trademark views about the United States as a propositional nation founded on natural rights theory. Jaffa combined his view of America\u2019s founding with obligatory worship of certain democratic statesmen and heroes, including Lincoln, Churchill, and Martin Luther King Jr. For more than 50 years, \u201cWest Coast Straussians\u201d have been feuding with more mainstream Straussians, who are centered mostly in Chicago or else on the East Coast. Not surprisingly, this second group of sectarians has come to be known as \u201cEast Coast Straussians.\u201d Since the latter are closely tied to Bill Kristol and became almost uniformly Never-Trumpers, their rivals predictably jumped onto the Trump-train. They thereupon set up websites that imbued populist rhetoric. This, of course, is something that neither Kristol nor his East Coast Straussian friends\u2014who seem ecstatically happy with Washington and the Deep State\u2014would ever attempt. To their credit, West Coast Straussian websites often post commentaries on legal and judicial matters that elicit my total agreement. I would be delighted if these websites simply stated some of their signature positions, such as criticizing judicial activism, without claiming to represent an entity called \u201cthe people.\u201d All that seems left of populism, a movement that arose in late 19th century America among rural and small-town populations, are a political style and distrust of elites. Unlike those who today appropriate this identity, American populists historically desired to return all domestic politics to the states and to create public utilities. Needless to say, I\u2019m not hearing today\u2019s so-called populists calling for either. It is entirely possible to criticize the centralized administrative state, crony capitalism, and the coercive imposition of Political Correctness without claiming (anachronistically) to be a populist. And one can and should engage in such criticism without pretending counterfactually to be speaking for \u201cthe people.\u201d Paul Gottfried is Raffensperger Professor of Humanities Emeritus at Elizabethtown College, where he taught for twenty-five years.

{"text":"Trump To Puerto Rico: Drop Dead: E-mail Rod Follow @roddreher america365\/Shutterstock How low can Donald Trump go? This low:  President Trump served notice Thursday that he may pull back federal relief workers from Puerto Rico, effectively threatening to abandon the U.S. territory amid a staggering humanitarian crisis in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Declaring the U.S. territory\u2019s electrical grid and infrastructure to have been a \u201cdisaster before hurricanes,\u201d Trump wrote Thursday that it will be up to Congress how much federal money to appropriate to the island for its recovery efforts and that recovery workers will not stay \u201cforever.\u201d In a trio of tweets, Trump wrote\u201d \u201cWe cannot keep FEMA, the Military  ; the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!\u201d Three weeks since Maria made landfall, much of Puerto Rico, an island of 3.4 million people, the vast majority of the island remains without power. Residents struggle to find clean water, hospitals are running short on medicine and commerce is slow with many businesses closed. Trump on Thursday sought to shame the territory for its own plight. He tweeted, \u201cElectric and all infrastructure was disaster before hurricanes.\u201d And he quoted Sharyl Attkisson, a television journalist, as saying, \u201cPuerto Rico survived the Hurricanes, now a financial crisis looms largely of their own making.\u201d  Those people \u2014 those American people \u2014 are flat on their backs. Hungry, sick, desperate \u2014 from a hurricane whose fault was not their own. Even if the financial crisis is of their own making, my God, the Puerto Ricans are living through a humanitarian catastrophe. This is indecent. I don\u2019t care if the mayor of San Juan is a loudmouth. People there are hurting. The American president is supposed to rise above that kind of thing. Come on, Congress, get into this! Republican members, do you have any heart, any spine? Stand up to this cruelty. We are the richest and most powerful nation in the world. It disgraces us that an American president would talk this way about the suffering. Check out Daniel Larison\u2019s take on the US Government\u2019s response to the disaster.Excerpt:  Even if we allow for the logistical problems in delivering and distributing food and water to everyone on the island, this is an inexcusable failure that needs to be corrected immediately. If a similar number of Americans on the mainland were without food and potable water for this long, it would be treated as a major scandal and it would be the top story in the news every day. Because it is happening in a territory with no political clout, it is not being taken as seriously as it should be. While the president repeatedly congratulates himself on what a great job he imagines he has done, the federal response to the disaster in Puerto Rico has been unacceptably poor. In terms of providing the most basic necessities in the wake of a major disaster, the government is failing millions of its citizens.  Where are Donald Trump\u2019s court Evangelicals on this? If you cannot stand up to your friend the US president when he threatens to stop sending humanitarian aid to American citizens who are hungry, thirsty, sick, and without shelter, then God help you when you come before the King of Kings. UPDATE: Some readers think that I\u2019m calling out all Evangelicals here. I\u2019m not.

{"text":"The Saddest Part of This Debate Happened Before the Debate Even Started: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton\u2019s second presidential debate on Sunday was basically a discomfiting freak show, with Trump threatening to throw Clinton in jail should he become president for something the Justice Department has ruled wasn\u2019t a crime, making no sense on policy foreign or domestic, admitting he hadn\u2019t paid federal income taxes and blaming Clinton for it, attacking his own running mate, and denying he sent out a tweet about a sex tape that he very much did send. But the most uncomfortable moment of the whole spectacle\u2014and perhaps saddest for the entire country\u2014happened before the event even started. Prior to the debate, Trump held an impromptu press event with a woman whose rapist Hillary Clinton defended when she was a public defense attorney and three women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct\u2014ranging from harassment to assault\u2014over the years. Trump then invited those women to sit in the front row of the audience in the same room as the man they say assaulted or harassed them in order to watch that man\u2019s wife\u2014who is seeking to become the first female president in the history of the United States\u2014debate a man who bragged on tape about sexual assault. That everyone involved was subjected to this\u2014from the accusers, to the accused, to the wife of the accused, to the entire populace of the country\u2014by the aforementioned grope bragger, Trump, is one of the most singularly awkward moments of this entire awkward affair we have called a presidential election.

{"text":"End the Imperial Presidency Before It's Too Late: Jim Urquhart \/ Reuters Wake up, establishment centrists: Donald Trump is coming! After the Vietnam War and Watergate and the spying scandals uncovered by the Church Committee and the Nixon Administration cronies who nearly firebombed the Brookings Institution, Americans were briefly inclined to rein in executive power\u2014a rebuke to Richard Nixon\u2019s claim that \u201cif the president does it, that means it\u2019s not illegal.\u201d Powerful committees were created to oversee misconduct-prone spy agencies. The War Powers Resolution revived a legislative check on warmaking. \u201cIn 34 years,\u201d Vice President Dick Cheney would lament to ABC News in a January 2002 interview, \u201cI have repeatedly seen an erosion of the powers and the ability of the president of the United States to do his job. I feel an obligation... to pass on our offices in better shape than we found them to our successors.\" The Bush Administration aggressively moved to expand executive power, drawing on the dubious legal maneuvering of David Addington, John Yoo, and their enablers. Starting in 2005, the junior senator from Illinois, Barack Obama, would repeatedly insist that Bush\u2019s assertions of executive power violated the Constitution. Nonetheless, Obama inherited a newly powerful executive branch, just as Cheney had hoped. And rather than dismantle it, Obama spent two terms lending the imprimatur of centrist, establishment bipartisanship to Cheney\u2019s vision. Now, Donald Trump is coming. Civil libertarians have long warned the partisans who trusted Bush and Obama, and the establishment centrists who couldn\u2019t imagine anyone in the White House besides an Al Gore or John Kerry or John McCain or Mitt Romney, that they were underestimating both the seriousness of civil liberties abuses under Bush and Obama and the likelihood of even less responsible leaders wreaking havoc in the White House. Three years ago, in \u201c All the Infrastructure a Tyrant Would Need, Courtesy of Bush and Obama,\u201d I warned that \u201cmore and more, we're counting on having angels in office and making ourselves vulnerable to devils,\u201d and that come January, 2017, an unknown person would enter the Oval Office and inherit all of these precedents: The president can order American citizens killed in secret. The president can detain prisoners indefinitely without charges or trial. The president can order drone strikes at will in countries against which no war has been declared. The president can start a torture program with impunity. The president can conduct warrantless surveillance on tens of millions of Americans. Now, Donald Trump is coming. And many establishment centrists are professing alarm. There is nothing more establishment than Robert Kagan, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, writing an op-ed in the Washington Post. He begins by observing that if Trump wins, his coalition will include tens of millions of Americans. \u201cImagine the power he would wield then,\u201d Kagan wrote. \u201cIn addition to all that comes from being the leader of a mass following, he would also have the immense powers of the American presidency at his command: the Justice Department, the FBI, the intelligence services, the military. Who would dare to oppose him then? Certainly not a Republican Party that laid down before him even when he was comparatively weak. Is a man like Trump, with infinitely greater power in his hands, likely to become more humble, more judicious, more generous, less vengeful than he is today, than he has been his whole life? Does vast power un-corrupt?\u201d Kagan\u2019s article seemed well-received among establishment centrists. Yet neither he nor most others who share his fears have yet acknowledged their bygone failures of imagination, or granted that civil libertarians were right: The establishment has permitted the American presidency to get dangerously powerful. While writing or sharing articles that compare Trump to Hitler, Mussolini, and Franco, few if any have called on Obama or Congress to act now \u201c to tyrant-proof the White House.\u201d However much they fear Trump, however rhetorically maximalist their warnings, even the prospect of him controlling the national security state does not cause them to renounce their reckless embrace of \u201c The Cult of the Presidency,\u201d a centrist religion that persisted across the Bush administration\u2019s torture chambers and the Obama administration\u2019s unlawful War in Libya. With a reality-TV bully on the doorstep of the White House, still they hesitate to urge reform to a branch of government they\u2019ve long regarded as more than co-equal. Their inaction is irresponsible. Just as the conservative movement is duty bound to grapple with its role in a populist demagogue seizing control of the GOP, establishment centrists ought to grapple with the implicit blessing they\u2019ve given to the extraordinary powers Trump would inherit, and that even the less-risky choice, Hillary Clinton, would abuse. The exercise would prove uncomfortable. The establishment centrists who oppose Trump worry, as they should, that he will violate the civil liberties of Muslim Americans, yet few spoke up when Michael Bloomberg presided over a secret program that profiled and spied on Muslim American students, generating zero counterterrorism leads. The establishment centrists who denounced Edward Snowden would have to admit that, if Trump is half as bad as they fear, Americans will be better served knowing the scope and capabilities of NSA surveillance than living in ignorance of it. Some will be forced to admit to themselves that they hope the military remains sprinkled with whistleblowers like Chelsea Manning to speak out against serious abuses. For 16 years or more, establishment centrists have been complicit in a historically reckless trend. Come 2017, it may place Donald Trump at a big table, much like the one on The Apprentice, where he\u2019ll decide not which B-list celebrity to fire, but which humans to kill. Establishment centrists could work to strip the presidency of that power. Instead they do nothing. We want to hear what you think about this article.

{"text":"FBI addresses Las Vegas shooter\u2019s motive, provides timeline for info release: Image source: TheBlaze FBI special agent Aaron Rouse, the chief of the FBI\u2019s Las Vegas office, revealed Wednesday that the agency might not be able to reveal Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock\u2019s motive until October. What did agent Rouse say? Rouse, who spoke to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, said that the report should be finalized by the massacre\u2019s anniversary date. \u201cNow that\u2019s a long time for some people, but speaking for the FBI, that\u2019s light speed, all right?\u201d Rouse said. \u201cAnd again, it will be thorough.\u201d \u201c[The FBI\u2019s report] is focusing a large part on the why, OK? Which is what everybody wants to know,\u201d Rouse reported. He added that through a thorough investigation of the incident, including those whom the FBI interviewed \u2014 upward of 400 people who had even the smallest connection with Paddock, according to the Review-Journal \u2014 he is confident that a comprehensive report will be released by October. \u201cI\u2019ve said this before: I believe at the end of this investigation we will have as many answers as we possibly can without talking to the subject themselves,\u201d Rouse explained. \u201cI am comfortable \u2014 underline comfortable \u2014 with the pace of the investigation, with the quality of the investigation, with the thoroughness of the investigation. We will have as many answers as we can possibly provide.\u201d What do they know about Paddock and the days leading up to the shooting? Rouse added that he doesn\u2019t believe Paddock committed the atrocity with any particular ideology or affiliation in mind, and he stood by the belief that Paddock acted alone in the shooting. \u201cI believe that there is one person and one person alone to blame for what happened on One October, and that is Stephen Paddock,\u201d Rouse added. Rouse later admitted that no one saw the shooting coming. \u201cI think that that\u2019s important for people to realize,\u201d he said. What\u2019s the history? Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock shot 58 concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival in October. Paddock then purportedly took his own life in a hotel suite at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. Law enforcement in November revealed what they thought could be a possible motive in the Las Vegas shooting, noting that \u201cstatus-driven,\u201d high-rolling gambler Paddock had been going through a period of depression, and had been losing money in his gambling endeavors. Is there more? According to the Review-Journal, here is the FBI\u2019s investigation of the Las Vegas shooting so far by the numbers: 400 specialists brought in; 1,500 leads followed locally, 500 worldwide; 400 people interviewed about the gunman; 40 terabytes of data collected; 22,000 hours of video collected; 250,000 images collected; 14 days to comb through the 15-acre festival site; 13 days to collect evidence inside Mandalay Bay; 12 federal search warrants filed; and 500 grand jury subpoenas issued.","label":0}
{"text":"Louis CK Pens Scathing Anti-Trump Letter: Trump \u2018Is Hitler\u2019 and \u2018We Are Being Germany in the 30s\u2019: Reuters There\u2019s no doubt that Donald Trump, the GOP\u2019s presidential frontrunner, is great for TV ratings. CBS Chairman Les Moonves recently remarked, \u201cIt may not be good for America, but it\u2019s damn good for CBS.\u201d He\u2019s an animated character\u2014orange, cotton candy hair, tiny hands, dictatorial posture\u2014like a cross between Mussolini, whose philosophy he seems to enjoy, and a particularly irascible Oompa Loompa. But underneath all the doth protest too much penis defenses and delayed Ku Klux Klan repudiations is a sinister despot who will stop at nothing to gain power\u2014this according to acclaimed comedian Louis CK, the latest celebrity to speak out against the populist, hate-filled rise of Trump. In his weekly email blast to fans, CK compared Trump to Hitler, calling him an \u201cinsane bigot\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d while calling upon conservatives to not vote for Trump, but instead cast their vote someone more moderate, like John Kasich. And if you think CK is a typical left-wing Hollywood-type, he attempted to put that notion to bed as well, writing, \u201cI\u2019m not advocating for Hillary or Bernie. I like them both but frankly I wish the next president was a conservative only because we had Obama for eight years and we need balance.\u201d CK\u2019s politics have always been fairly nebulous and hard to pin down. Speaking to ThinkProgress in 2012, he expanded on his political views a bit: \u201cI don\u2019t have any political opinions, I just am very curious,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very interesting to listen to what people say. What\u2019s the best way to run a country and the world? Those are really profound questions. I don\u2019t have the confidence to say that I know one way or another. Some things I think are very conservative, or very liberal. I think when someone falls into one category for everything, I\u2019m very suspicious. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me that you\u2019d have the same solution to every issue. I just like listening. I try to take people who are way far away from what I think or understand and put a representative of them on my show. I like to try to learn form them.\u201d And years ago, well before Trump ran for president, CK told a story to a radio station about how he once rode the elevator with Trump at Trump\u2019s Castle (now the Golden Nugget)\u2014his sprawling casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. \u201c[Trump] just looked miserable,\u201d said CK. \u201cHe looked so unhappy. And all that money, I realized he has all these billions of dollars, but he\u2019s fuckin\u2019 miserable because he needs $100 billion to look in the mirror and not want to kill himself.\u201d Well, Louis CK has apparently learned all he has to from candidate Trump. The anti-Trump screed came at the end of CK\u2019s email newsletter touting his new show Horace and Pete\u2014a very long, very pointed postscript. You can read it here: P.S. Please stop it with voting for Trump. It was funny for a little while. But the guy is Hitler. And by that I mean that we are being Germany in the 30s. Do you think they saw the shit coming? Hitler was just some hilarious and refreshing dude with a weird comb over who would say anything at all. And I\u2019m not advocating for Hillary or Bernie. I like them both but frankly I wish the next president was a conservative only because we had Obama for eight years and we need balance. And not because I particularly enjoy the conservative agenda. I just think the government should reflect the people. And we are about 40 percent conservative and 40 percent liberal. When I was growing up and when I was a younger man, liberals and conservatives were friends with differences. They weren\u2019t enemies. And it always made sense that everyone gets a president they like for a while and then hates the president for a while. But it only works if the conservatives put up a good candidate. A good smart conservative to face the liberal candidate so they can have a good argument and the country can decide which way to go this time. Trump is not that. He's an insane bigot. He is dangerous. He already said he would expand libel laws to sue anyone who \"writes a negative hit piece\" about him. He says \"I would open up the libel laws so we can sue them and win lots of money. Not like now. These guys are totally protected.\" He said that. He has promised to decimate the first amendment. (If you think he\u2019s going to keep the second amendment intact you\u2019re delusional.) And he said that Paul Ryan, speaker of the house will \"pay\" for criticizing him. So I'm saying this now because if he gets in there we won't be able to criticize him anymore. Please pick someone else. Like John Kasich. I mean that guy seems okay. I don't like any of them myself but if you're that kind of voter please go for a guy like that. It feels like between him and either democrat we'd have a decent choice. It feels like a healthier choice. We shouldn't have to vote for someone because they're not a shocking cunt billionaire liar. We should choose based on what direction the country should go. I get that all these people sound like bullshit soft criminal opportunists. The whole game feels rigged and it's not going anywhere but down anymore. I feel that way sometimes. And that voting for Trump is a way of saying \"fuck it. Fuck them all\". I really get it. It's a version of national Suicide. Or it's like a big hit off of a crack pipe. Somehow we can't help it. Or we know that if we vote for Trump our phones will be a reliable source of dopamine for the next four years. I mean I can't wait to read about Trump every day. It's a rush. But you have to know this is not healthy. If you are a true conservative. Don't vote for Trump. He is not one of you. He is one of him. Everything you have heard him say that you liked, if you look hard enough you will see that he one day said the exact opposite. He is playing you. In fact, if you do vote for Trump, at least look at him very carefully first. You owe that to the rest of us. Know and understand who he is. Spend one hour on google and just read it all. I don\u2019t mean listen to me or listen to liberals who put him down. Listen to your own people. Listen to John Mccain. Go look at what he just said about Trump. \"At a time when our world has never been more complex or more in danger... I want Republican voters to pay close attention to what our party's most respected and knowledgeable leaders and national security experts are saying about Mr. Trump, and to think long and hard about who they want to be our next Commander-in-Chief and leader of the free world.\u201d When Trump was told what he said, Trump said \"Oh, he did? Well, that's not nice,\" he told CBS News' chief White House correspondent Major Garrett. \"He has to be very careful.\" When pressed on why, Trump tacked on: \"He'll find out.\u201d (I cut and pasted that from CBS news) Do you really want a guy to be president who threatens John McCain? Because John McCain cautiously and intelligently asked for people to be thoughtful before voting for him? He didn\u2019t even insult Trump. He just asked you to take a good look. And Trump told him to look out. Remember that Trump entered this race by saying that McCain is not a war hero. A guy who was shot down, body broken and kept in a POW camp for years. Trump said \u201cI prefer the guys who don\u2019t get caught.\u201d Why did he say that? Not because he meant it or because it was important to say. He said it because he\u2019s a bully and every bully knows that when you enter a new school yard, you go to the toughest most respected guy on the yard and you punch him in the nose. If you are still standing after, you\u2019re the new boss. If Trump is president, he\u2019s not going to change. He\u2019s not going to do anything for you. He\u2019s going to do everything for himself and leave you in the dust. So please listen to fellow conservatives. But more importantly, listen to Trump. Listen to all of it. Everything he says. If you liked when he said that \u201ctorture works\u201d then go look at where he took it back the next day. He\u2019s a fucking liar. A vote for Trump is so clearly a gut-vote, and again I get it. But add a little brain to it and look the guy up. Because if you vote for him because of how you feel right now, the minute he's president, you're going to regret it. You're going to regret it even more when he gives the job to his son. Because American democracy is broken enough that a guy like that could really fuck things up. That's how Hitler got there. He was voted into power by a fatigued nation and when he got inside, he did all his Hitler things and no one could stop him. Again, I\u2019m not saying vote democrat or vote for anyone else. If Hilary ends up president it should be because she faced the best person you have and you and I both chose her or him or whoever. Trump is not your best. He\u2019s the worst of all of us. He\u2019s a symptom to a problem that is very real. But don\u2019t vote for your own cancer. You\u2019re better than that. That's just my view. At least right now. I know I\u2019m not qualified or particularly educated and I'm not right instead of you. I\u2019m an idiot and I'm sure a bunch of you are very annoyed by this. Fucking celebrity with an opinion. I swear this isn\u2019t really a political opinion. You don\u2019t want to know my political opinions. (And I know that I\u2019m only bringing myself trouble with this shit.) Trump has nothing to do with politics or ideology. He has to do with himself. And really I don't mean to insult anyone. Except Trump. I mean to insult him very much. And really I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s evil or a monster. In fact I don\u2019t think Hitler was. The problem with saying that guys like that are monsters is that we don\u2019t see them coming when they turn out to be human, which they all are. Everyone is. Trump is a messed up guy with a hole in his heart that he tries to fill with money and attention. He can never ever have enough of either and he\u2019ll never stop trying. He\u2019s sick. Which makes him really really interesting. And he pulls you towards him which somehow feels good or fascinatingly bad. He\u2019s not a monster. He\u2019s a sad man. But all this makes him horribly dangerous if he becomes president. Give him another TV show. Let him pay to put his name on buildings. But please stop voting for him. And please watch Horace and Pete.","label":1}
{"text":"Bill Maher\u2019s Urgent Plea for Decency in U.S. Politics: \u2018Trump Didn\u2019t Create This Swamp\u2019: After a few weeks off, political satirist Bill Maher emerged refreshed and more cynical than ever on his program Real Time Friday night. The comedian addressed the week\u2019s biggest controversy during his monologue\u2014Trump finally acknowledging after being at the forefront of a five-year racist crusade against the first black president that Barack Obama was born in the United States. As is his wont, the bloated ex-reality show host delivered the news in true Trumpian fashion: in seven seconds, during a press conference announcing the grand opening of his tacky new hotel, while flanked by a fellow birther (Thomas McInerney, a retired Air Force lieutenant general), claiming Obama should be thankful that he \u201cfinished\u201d the racist speculation he stoked, and that Hillary Clinton started the birther movement (a bold-faced lie). \u201cHe blamed it on Hillary. Of course,\u201d said Maher, rolling his eyes. \u201cBecause even when [Trump] admits he lies, he has to tell another giant lie! He says Hillary and her campaign started birtherism in 2008, which is something contradicted only by newspapers, television, Twitter, eyes, ears, and smell. Hillary started birtherism? Oh yes, I think we all remember that. I think it was right after Hillary\u2019s casinos went bankrupt.\u201d A softball, Fallon-esque softball interview with Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway\u2014who\u2019s been a guest and pal of Maher\u2019s for twenty years dating back to his ABC series Politically Incorrect\u2014followed, as did a bickering panel wherein political pundit Margaret Hoover, serving as the moderate voice of reason, assured the American people that the country \u201cwill survive\u201d regardless of who wins the presidency (Hoover is also the wife of Daily Beast EIC John Avlon). But the night\u2019s biggest highlight came courtesy of Maher himself. During a his \u201cNew Rules\u201d segment, he delivered an important monologue about the need for a return to decency in American politics. \u201cBoth candidates must sign a pledge that whoever loses the election in November, whether it\u2019s Hillary or whether it\u2019s Orange Hitler, the loser has to congratulate the winner and concede graciously. Why? Because civility is nearly dead in this country and we need to return to some basic level of bipartisan decency and respect for our opponents,\u201d offered Maher. \u201cIf you want to know why our country is so tense and our government doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s because society functions on some basic rules of conduct and they\u2019re all going away. It\u2019s why filibustering has become not a rare principled protest, but the everyday automatic cockblocking that defines government now,\u201d he continued. \u201cTed Cruz filibustered Obamacare for nearly a day by reading Green Eggs and Ham: a book about how you might like something if you give it a chance. It\u2019s why Republicans, who claim to worship the Constitution, can just ignore their duty in fulfilling a Supreme Court vacancy. And speaking of the Supreme Court, which used to stay supremely out of partisan bickering, it\u2019s why Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2014yes, even sweet, scholarly, grandmotherly Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2014talked trash about Trump this year like she was in a rap battle.\u201d \u201cBut I gotta tell ya: Donald Trump didn\u2019t create this swamp. He just rose from it. He and Hillary are the first two candidates in memory not to call and congratulate each other after they won their respective races. Forever, that\u2019s what people did! Even Al Gore called George W. Bush after he lost\u2014and he didn\u2019t even lose! In the Senate, members used to refer to each other as \u2018my friend from the other side of the aisle.\u2019 They didn\u2019t mean it literally, of course\u2014no one thinks of Ted Cruz as a friend\u2014but you say it anyway.\u201d Maher then pointed to the birther movement as playing a large role in the disintegration of bipartisanship in America, but also to when Republican Congressman Joe Wilson of South Carolina shouted \u201cYou lie!\u201d at POTUS while he delivered a 2009 speech to the joint session of Congress, as well as racist and homophobic Maine Gov. Paul LePage leaving a voicemail for one of his political opponents labeling him a \u201csocialist cocksucker.\u201d \u201cI keep saying that this election is a referendum on decency. It\u2019s a chance to reject the gutter and punish people who want to live there, but right now, we are rewarding them,\u201d said Maher. \u201cThe guy who said \u2018You lie?\u2019 The next day donations poured into his coffers because now in America, when you act like an asshole you\u2019re a hero.\u201d He then cut to footage of politicians coming to blows in various parliaments around the world. \u201cThis is what parliament looks like on a bad day in the Ukraine. And here\u2019s the Turkish parliament. And the one in South Korea. And the one in Nepal. Yeah, we laugh at it, but that is where we\u2019re headed, because the real infectious disease that\u2019s threatening our election isn\u2019t pneumonia\u2014it\u2019s a total lack of class.\u201d","label":0}
{"text":"Seth Meyers Calls Out Thrice-Married Trump\u2019s Infidelity Hypocrisy: NBC Whereas Late Show\u2019s Stephen Colbert broadcast live following the not-so-hotly anticipated vice-presidential debate between Mike Pence and Tim Kaine, Late Night\u2019s Seth Meyers went the pre-taped route\u2014instead choosing to focus on the continued fallout from Trump\u2019s embarrassing loss in the first presidential debate. \u201cTrump went on for days insisting that he won the debate, while also complaining about his broken microphone,\u201d said Meyers, adding, \u201cTrump\u2019s campaign did try [to move on], telling the media that at a rally on Saturday night Trump would \u2018\u2026deliver a nine-sentence critique of comments Hillary Clinton made months ago about many of the millennials supporting her primary rival, Bernie Sanders.\u2019\u201d Those comments, which were misinterpreted by Politico and The Intercept, actually served as an example of Hillary showing empathy toward Sanders supporters\u2014a sentiment echoed by Sanders himself, who said her comments were \u201cabsolutely correct.\u201d Of course, even that alleged \u201cnine-sentence critique\u201d proved difficult for Donald. \u201cTrump has essentially been in the middle of the same run-on sentence for about a year now. And unfortunately for his campaign, he went on so many angry, unhinged tangents that, according to The Washington Post, \u2018It took Trump 25 minutes to read the [nine-sentence] statement,\u2019\u201d said Meyers. \u201cWhy did it take 25 minutes to get through nine sentences? Because Trump had to do some classic stand-up comedy: like when he mocked Hillary Clinton\u2019s pneumonia\u2014and a brief fainting spell she suffered as a result.\u201d \u201cAnd then Trump,\u201d added Meyers, \u201cwho has spent days attacking Hillary Clinton for her husband\u2019s infidelities, claimed that Hillary herself had probably cheated on Bill.\u201d Cue Trump at the rally: \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s only loyalty is to her financial contributors and to herself. I don\u2019t even think she\u2019s loyal to Bill, if you want to know the truth.\u201d Yep, you read that right: Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton, a woman who\u2019s held her family together amid affairs by her husband, of committing adultery based on no evidence whatsoever. But, like most accusations hurled by Trump, it\u2019s pure projection. For if you recall, Trump is on his third marriage. His first, to Ivana, ended acrimoniously when Trump carried on a very public affair with Marla Maples. \u201cBy 1987, during services at the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, Trump was secretly romancing Maples as he found ways to temporarily ditch Ivana and their kids,\u201d reported People magazine.If that weren\u2019t enough, during the subsequent divorce proceedings, Ivana reportedly accused Donald of a violent rape. \u201cOf course, Trump\u2019s own first marriage ended when he cheated on [Ivana] with his eventual second wife [Maples],\u201d said Meyers. \u201cSo you might think maybe this isn\u2019t the best argument for Trump to make\u2014which is why the Trump team sent their best man, Rudy Giuliani, to go on TV and make it again.\u201d Sure enough, the former New York mayor appeared on numerous cable-news programs defending Trump\u2019s baseless smear against Hillary, telling CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper it was \u201cfair game\u201d and Meet the Press\u2019s Chuck Todd that \u201ceverybody\u201d commits infidelities. Rudy would know. His first marriage, to his second-cousin Regina Peruggi, ended in divorce, and his second marriage, to Donna Hanover, ended when he conducted a high-profile affair with Judith Nathan\u2014even going so far as providing her with security and chauffeur services courtesy of the NYPD while he was mayor (translation: taxpayers helped pay for Rudy concealing his affair). The Trump camp\u2019s hypocrisy apparently knows no bounds.","label":1}
{"text":"Louis C.K. on the Time He Met the \u2018Real Trump\u2019: A \u2018Miserable,\u2019 Money-Grubbing Narcissist: FX According to Louis C.K., Trump supporters are essentially charitable givers. On Friday night, the beloved comic behind Louie and Horace and Pete took on The New Yorker Festival in a 90-minute chat with television critic Emily Nussbaum. In the heart of Times Square, the writer and director unloaded on the Republican presidential candidate and the massive, greedy hole where his heart should be. Talking in depth about Horace and Pete, C.K.\u2019s 10-episode online tragedy, Nussbaum and C.K. naturally transitioned from discussing \u201cperfect narcissists\u201d onscreen to the raging egomaniac currently trampling towards the White House. According to the seasoned comedian, \u201cPeople are usually bad when they\u2019re hurting.\u201d His lifelong desire to give disgusting people emotional depth has made C.K. into a keen observer of human behavior. When Nussbaum asked him about a specific reference in Horace and Pete to the \u201cpresident-hole\u201d that Trump is trying to fill, Louis revealed that his musings on the tax-evading real estate tycoon were many years in the making: \u201cIt\u2019s something I thought about Trump a long time ago, because I met him in an elevator.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s where you want to meet the dude,\u201d Louis quipped. \u201cThat\u2019s the real Trump.\u201d But C.K. wasn\u2019t kidding. Apparently, the comedian was working at a Trump casino, many years ago, when the run-in went down. While working at what was doubtlessly an impeccably-run, fine establishment\u2014Trump\u2019s Castle in Atlantic City\u2014C.K. started to notice a disturbing trend. \u201cI saw this thing happening where buses were showing up from all over the country with little old ladies,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey take what little they have\u2026They take that nothing, the little tiny scraps, and they turn it into chips and they pour buckets of money into his machines.\u201d When Trump and his toupee finally made an appearance in Atlantic City, Louis was shocked to see that he just walked around, expressing absolutely no gratitude to the folks who filled his coffers. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say \u2018thank you\u2019 to anybody, he just walked around\u2026 and when I was in the elevator with him I just looked in his face, and he was just miserable looking. And everybody was so excited to see him, and they\u2019re giving him everything.\u201d At this point, C.K. came up with the theory that fueled that Horace and Pete punchline. He recalled thinking, \u201cHe has everything, right? And they\u2019re leaving on the same bus just with nothing; they\u2019re ruining their lives. And I saw this like as a reverse-charity\u2026These women, these old ladies, they don\u2019t need anything. They live in a shitty place and they have two dollars, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Eh, I don\u2019t need it, it\u2019s ok, he needs it!\u2019 If he looks in the mirror, and he has ten dollars, he\u2019s going to kill himself.\u201d He concluded, \u201cHe has a $10 billion deficit in his heart. So if he doesn\u2019t have that much money, he\u2019s nothing. So they were like, \u2018Donald, you take this!\u2019 Because they\u2019re invested in his charity.\u2019\u201d After the uproarious applause died down, Louis noted, solemnly, that Trump\u2019s insatiable love of money has somehow metastasized into a president-sized hole: \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Thank you for your money, now I need control over your lives.\u2019\u201d When Nussbaum followed up by comparing Trump to an insult comic and asking if Louis had any comedian\u2019s wisdom for Hillary to take him down, he was quick to differentiate Trump\u2019s unstudied craft from the work of seasoned professionals.

That\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this whole election: Because we\u2019d rather watch awful shit than have good roads and have poor people not die all the time.\u201d As for Hillary, Louis was adamant, \u201cI don\u2019t think she needs any advice from anybody. She\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d He even said that the former Secretary of State, \u201cReminds me of my mom\u2014she works hard, and then she goes, \u2018All right, go ahead and talk, I\u2019m doing this.\u2019 So I like her.\u201d And for the people who insist that Clinton is a liar and a crook, Louis has one, small, question: \u201cWhat the fuck do you know?\u201d","label":1}

{"text":"Could Missouri Be in Play Now, Too? Jay Nixon Thinks So.: Jay Nixon. Saul Loeb\/AFP\/Getty Images ST. LOUIS\u2014Missouri has a competitive Senate race. It has a competitive governor's race. According to polls of the presidential race, though, there\u2019s not much of a contest here in the state that Sen. Barack Obama lost by only a few thousand votes in 2008. Trump enjoys a 10.6 percentage point lead here, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average. It\u2019s one of the few states in the country where Trump is running ahead of the Republican candidates in prestige, statewide downballot races. But Jay Nixon, Missouri\u2019s outgoing Democratic governor, isn\u2019t so sure Trump can bank on the state\u2019s 10 electoral votes just yet. \u201cWell, he hasn\u2019t had a good week. Haven\u2019t seen any numbers recently,\u201d he told Slate at Washington University ahead of Sunday\u2019s second debate. \u201cI think Missouri\u2019s a state where you still have enough undecideds to get this race close. I think it will tighten. I think that his conduct over the last\u2014both in the last debate as well as over the last 10 days\u2014is something that jars people. This is not the way presidents are supposed to act or talk.\u201d Nixon was walking on Wash U\u2019s main lawn shaking hands with students, surrounded by a few bodyguards. It wasn\u2019t the most \u2026 natural of settings. Nixon is a middle-aged conservative Democrat, and here he was mixing with students trying to garner attention for themselves in their own, trollish baccalaureate ways. More than one student was holding a \u201cLizard People for Hillary\u201d sign, while another American-flag-garbed student held a banner reading, \u201cOutback Steakhouse for Trump.\u201d (He had a second, handwritten poster: \u201cBloomin\u2019 Onion now only $7.00.\") Two other students standing next to each other held up color-coordinated signs that read, respectively, \u201cProud Muslim\u201d and \u201cHarambe 2016.\u201d Music was playing, students were eating ice cream and pizza, or grabbing free Fox News T-shirts by the network\u2019s adjacent set. And then there was the governor, wandering through it all. Nixon added that it would be unwise for Trump to go after Bill Clinton\u2019s affairs and Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in aiding her husband in the cover-ups. \u201cI think that if he does what I think a lot of people think he might do tonight\u2014come out and try to attack somebody who used to be president, when he\u2019s talking to somebody who\u2019s going to be president\u2014I think that\u2019s a serious mistake,\u201d he said. So how should Hillary Clinton respond when Trump definitely does that? \u201cLike any woman, if they\u2019re pushed in that direction, they need to be very clear, they need to be unambiguous, and they need to call out his behavior to the American people.\u201d He said it\u2019s up to the Clinton campaign to decide whether it\u2019s worth it for them to make an appearance in Missouri. It\u2019s not\u2014unless she just wants to psych out Trump. If Hillary Clinton wins Missouri, she\u2019s already won somewhere north of 350 electoral votes. It will be a state caught up in a landslide, the possibility of which seems much more likely than it did 72 hours ago.","label":0}

{"text":"Trump campaigning in stretch like it all depends on Florida: PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) \u2014 With the turbulent White House race scrambled in new directions, Donald Trump is campaigning with rare discipline like his presidential campaign hinges on one all-too-familiar swing state: Florida. \u201c\u2018Stay on point, Donald, stay on point,'\u201d the Republican nominee, in Pensacola, teasingly quoted his staff as saying. \u201cNo sidetracks, Donald. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.'\u201d There was late action Wednesday in such unlikely arenas as Arizona and Michigan, too \u2014 and in North Carolina, where President Barack Obama tried to energize black support for Hillary Clinton. But Trump marched ahead in his third multi-day visit to the Sunshine State in recent weeks. The Republican nominee lashed out at \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d in Miami, predicting that a Clinton victory would trigger an \u201cunprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis\u201d as federal investigators probe the former secretary of state\u2019s email practices. But Trump did not take the bait dangled by the Clinton campaign about his treatment of women. Conceding nothing in the state, Clinton has also been a frequent visitor. She posed for pictures and shook hands during a surprise visit to a South Florida Caribbean-American neighborhood Wednesday morning. Both sides agree the New York businessman has virtually no chance to win the presidency without Florida\u2019s trove of 29 electoral votes. Clinton has been ahead there in opinion polls, but Democrats acknowledge that the FBI\u2019s renewed attention to her has helped rally reluctant Republicans behind their nominee. That\u2019s given Trump an enthusiasm boost in Florida and across Midwestern battlegrounds long considered reliably blue territory. \u201cI\u2019m definitely nervous,\u201d said former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat. \u201cDemocrats in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, if you heard it was over, if you thought those states were in the bag, don\u2019t believe it.\u201d Perhaps heeding Rendell\u2019s warning, Clinton\u2019s team is devoting new resources to states like Michigan, which hasn\u2019t supported a Republican presidential nominee in nearly three decades. Former President Bill Clinton was making an unannounced appearance in Detroit Wednesday night to meet privately with black ministers, the city\u2019s mayor and other local leaders. While Hillary Clinton had two appearances Wednesday in Republican-leaning Arizona, she planned to spend part of Friday in Detroit as well. At the same time, a pro-Clinton super PAC was spending more than $1 million on Michigan airwaves along with at least $1 million more in Colorado, another state where Clinton has enjoyed a significant polling advantage for much of the fall. Early voting numbers in some states suggest that her challenge stems, at least in part, from underwhelming support from African-American voters. Weak minority support could complicate her path in other states, too, including North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Early voting in North Carolina shows a 5 percentage point drop in ballots from black voters from 2012. Obama, the nation\u2019s first black president, offered an urgent message to North Carolina voters on Wednesday: \u201cThe fate of the Republic rests on your shoulders.\u201d He also criticized Trump\u2019s history of sexist comments and his initial reluctance to disavow white supremacists. They continue to rally behind the Republican nominee, though he rejects that support. \u201cIf you accept the support of Klan sympathizers,\u201d Obama said, \u201cthen you\u2019ll tolerate that support when you\u2019re in office.\u201d At the same time, Clinton allies are speaking directly to black voters in a new advertising campaign running in Ohio, North Carolina and Florida. The ad from the pro-Clinton Priorities USA shows white Trump supporters screaming at and pushing black protesters, along with Obama warning that voters would lose \u201ceverything\u201d if Trump wins. As the final-days scramble for votes intensifies, Florida remains perhaps the nation\u2019s most critical swing state. The Trump campaign knows there is no realistic path to the White House without Florida, where polls give Clinton a narrow lead. The New York businessman campaigned in three Florida cities Wednesday \u2014 Miami, Orlando and Pensacola \u2014 and will follow up with a stop in Jacksonville on Thursday. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to blow this,\u201d he told rowdy supporters in Miami. \u201cWe gotta win. We gotta win big.\u201d While Trump has devoted perhaps his most valuable resource \u2014 his time \u2014 to Florida, Clinton has built a powerful ground game, backed by a dominant media presence, that dwarfs her opponent\u2019s. The Democratic nominee has more than doubled Trump\u2019s investment in Florida television ads. Overall, the state has been deluged with $125 million in general election advertising \u2014 by far the most of any state. Clinton, unlike Trump, can also afford to lose here. Even with national polls narrowing, the Democratic contender has many more paths to 270 electoral votes. One example: Clinton campaigned Wednesday in Arizona, a state that has voted for Republican presidential candidates all but once since 1952. ___ Peoples reported from Washington.

BELOIT, Wis. (AP) \u2014 Hillary Clinton could face impeachment if she is elected president because her use of a private email server as secretary of state broke the law, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said. In an interview, Johnson told the Beloit Daily News (http:\/\/bit.ly\/2eS9hcp) on Monday that Clinton \u201cpurposefully circumvented\u201d the law. The Republican said, \u201cthis was willful concealment and destruction\u201d involving information related to national defense. Federal law provides anyone found to have concealed or removed such records is disqualified from holding office, Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer, but this is clearly written,\u201d said Johnson, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. \u201cI would say yes, high crime or misdemeanor, I believe she is in violation of both laws.\u201d The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Johnson is locked in a re-election battle with Democrat Russ Feingold, whom he defeated in 2010. Johnson said he believes the initial FBI investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server was not in pursuit of truth, but instead was intended to cover up her actions. In July, FBI Director James Comey said Clinton had been careless with classified information but he declined to prosecute her. \u201cThat was a corrupt conclusion,\u201d Johnson said of the results of the investigation. On Friday, FBI Director James Comey told Congress that the bureau had discovered additional emails that might be relevant to the Clinton email case. ___ Information from: Beloit Daily News, http:\/\/www.beloitdailynews.com","label":0}

{"text":"FBI Director James Comey erred by bowing to the howls of the right: FBI Director James Comey testifies before the House Oversight Committee, on Capitol Hill in Washington, July 7, 2016. Hillary Clinton supporters and even some Republicans have blasted Comey for the timing of his Oct. 28 letter to Congress disclosing new emails that could be connected to the dormant inquiry into Clinton\u2019s private email server. (Al Drago\/The New York Times) The cryptic letter James Comey, the FBI director, sent to Congress on Friday looked bizarre at the time \u2014 seeming to hint at a major new Clinton scandal, but offering no substance. Given what we know now, however, it was worse than bizarre, it was outrageous. Comey apparently had no evidence suggesting any wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton; he violated long-standing rules about commenting on politically sensitive investigations close to an election; and he did so despite being warned by other officials that he was doing something terribly wrong. So what happened? We may never know the full story, but the best guess is that Comey, like many others \u2014 media organizations, would-be nonpartisan advocacy groups, and more \u2014 let himself be bullied by the usual suspects. Working the refs \u2014 screaming about bias and unfair treatment, no matter how favorable the treatment actually is \u2014 has been a consistent, long-term political strategy on the right. And the reason it keeps happening is because it so often works. You see this most obviously in news coverage. Reporters who find themselves shut up in pens at Donald Trump rallies while the crowd shouts abuse shouldn\u2019t be surprised: constant accusations of liberal media bias have been a staple of Republican rhetoric for decades. And why not? The pressure has been effective. Part of this effectiveness comes through false equivalence: news organizations, afraid of being attacked for bias, give evenhanded treatment to lies and truth. Way back in 2000 I suggested that if a Republican candidate said that the earth was flat, headlines would read, \u201cViews differ on shape of planet.\u201d That still happens. The desire to get right-wing critics off one\u2019s back may also explain why the news media keep falling for fake scandals. There\u2019s a straight line from the Whitewater investigation \u2014 which ran for seven years, was endlessly hyped in the press, but never found any wrongdoing on the part of the Clintons \u2014 to the catastrophically bad coverage of the Clinton Foundation a couple of months ago. Remember when The Associated Press suggested scandalous undue influence based on a meeting between Hillary Clinton and a donor who just happened to be both a Nobel Prize winner and an old personal friend? Sure enough, much of the initial coverage of the Comey letter was based not on what the letter said, which was very little, but on a false, malicious characterization of the letter by Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. You might think reporters would have learned by now not to take what people like Chaffetz say at face value. Apparently not. Nor is it just the news media. A few years ago, during the peak of deficit-scold influence, it was striking to see the various organizations demanding deficit reduction pretend that Democrats who were willing to compromise and Republicans who insisted on slashing taxes for the wealthy were equally at fault. They even gave a \u201cfiscal responsibility\u201d award to Paul Ryan, whose budget proposals gave smoke and mirrors a bad name. And as someone who still keeps a foot in the academic world, I\u2019ve been watching pressure build on universities to hire more conservatives. Never mind the way climate denial, attacks on the theory of evolution, and all that may have pushed academics out of the GOP. The fact that relatively few conservatives teach, say, physics, is supposed to be grossly unfair. And you know some schools will start hiring less qualified people in response. Which brings us back to Comey. It seemed obvious from the start that Clinton\u2019s decision to follow Colin Powell\u2019s advice and bypass State Department email was a mistake, but nothing remotely approaching a crime. But Comey was subjected to a constant barrage of demands that he prosecute her for \u2026 something. He should simply have said no. Instead, even while announcing back in July that no charges would be filed, he editorialized about her conduct \u2014 a wholly inappropriate thing to do, but probably an attempt to appease the right. It didn\u2019t work, of course. They just demanded more. And it looks as if he tried to buy them off by throwing them a bone just a few days before the election. Whether it will matter politically remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: he destroyed his own reputation. The moral of the story is that appeasing the modern American right is a losing proposition. Nothing you do convinces them that you\u2019re being fair, because fairness has nothing to do with it. The right long ago ran out of good ideas that can be sold on their own merits, so the goal now is to remove merit from the picture. Or to put it another way, they\u2019re trying to create bias, not end it, and weakness \u2014 the kind of weakness Comey has so spectacularly displayed \u2014 only encourages them to do more.","label":1}
{"text":"Sanders\u2019 donors in Seattle haven\u2019t opened wallets to Clinton: Democratic candidate for United States President Hillary Clinton (L) and Senator Bernie Sanders (R) appear at campaign stop where they talked about Clinton\u2019s plan for less expensive education, at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, New Hampshire, USA, September 28, 2016. EPA\/CJ GUNTHER Seattle has a new kind of 1 percenter. Of the 24,700 city residents who contributed to Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primaries, just 261 \u2014 a smidgen over 1 percent \u2014 have gone on to give money to another presidential candidate. Of that small group, nearly all have moved their donation to Hillary Clinton. Green Party candidate Jill Stein received money from just 20 ex-Sanders supporters, but that\u2019s enough to rank second. That data comes from Crowdpac, a nonpartisan political-research startup based in based in Menlo Park, Calif. Their team developed an algorithm to analyze data from campaign-contribution records, making it possible to track the donation history of individuals across election cycles. Perhaps what they found is not surprising. Sanders inspired a legion of small-time contributors, many of whom might not normally donate to a political campaign at all. The data suggest that Seattle is indeed a \u201cBernie or bust\u201d town \u2014 at least when it comes to giving money to other candidates. As I wrote back in March, we fell hard for Sanders, shelling out more per capita to his campaign than residents of any other major city. Chelsea Nesvig, an academic librarian who lives on Capitol Hill, remembers her disappointment when the Vermont senator endorsed Clinton, signaling that his fight for the White House was over. Nesvig, who made a couple of small donations to Sanders, is among the roughly 24,000 in Seattle who have not contributed to another candidate. Still, Nesvig will cast her vote for Clinton. The possibility of a Trump presidency, she feels, is too frightening. Nesvig cautiously calls herself a Clinton supporter \u2014 \u201cAre you a supporter if you just say you\u2019re going to vote for her?\u201d \u2014 but has no plans to send any money Clinton\u2019s way. \u201cI feel like she\u2019s got plenty of money,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the things I don\u2019t love about her.\u201d But Dallas Taylor, a novelist and freelance carpenter on Capitol Hill, didn\u2019t skip a beat moving on from Bernie to Hillary, whom he supports enthusiastically. \u201cI switched my ActBlue monthly donations to Hillary about a month before the convention, when it was clear that she had it,\u201d he said. He wasn\u2019t terribly surprised to learn that he\u2019s among the 1 percent: \u201cA lot of the super hard-core Bernie people, especially in Seattle, are privileged enough not to be endangered by a Trump presidency directly,\u201d he said. Taylor, who calls himself a pragmatic progressive, says he never expected Sanders would win. But he felt the campaign was important in how it democratized fundraising and forced Clinton more to the left. These days, he\u2019s trying to convince his progressive friends to get behind Clinton. \u201cI really believe that deep in her heart, Hillary Clinton is a progressive. But she\u2019s also a realist. Nobody plays at that level without getting a little dirty,\u2019 he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never held that against her \u2026 and people have this perception that she\u2019s much dirtier than she is.\u201d He\u2019d have a hard time convincing Susan Jacobs, a lighting designer from West Seattle.

While she has a very low opinion of Donald Trump, Jacobs doesn\u2019t feel Clinton is that much better. \u201cThis is our choice \u2014 Trump or Hillary? That\u2019s absurd,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to vote for the person who most aligns with my values, and that\u2019s Jill Stein.\u201d Jacob, who contributed to Sanders, hasn\u2019t given to Stein yet. But she\u2019s considering it. Just eight Seattleites who gave money to Sanders have donated to Donald Trump. I managed to track one of them down. I told him he was one of eight. \u201cIt makes me kind of interesting,\u201d he replied. A tech worker who lives in Belltown, he would only talk to me if his name wasn\u2019t used, saying he was afraid of repercussions at his workplace. Though he calls his feelings about Trump \u201ccomplicated,\u201d he sent him money because \u201c \u2026 he is the only credible outsider at this time.\u201d Even so, he might vote for Gary Johnson. the Libertarian candidate, or Stein. The one thing he\u2019s sure of is that he won\u2019t vote for Clinton. \u201cHillary is part of an insider group that\u2019s getting bigger and bigger,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a real threat.\u201d One caveat: The data on candidate contributions present only a partial picture. By law, contributions of $200 or more are required to have donor names and other information. Small individual donations may not be included in the data.","label":0}
{"text":"Editorial: California burns: Where\u2019s the president?: As raging wildfires devour the lives, homes and dreams of Californians in an unprecedented scale, one voice has been conspicuously mute through day after day of crisis: President Trump. This is not a man who is reticent to let Americans know what is foremost on his mind. He is also someone who should have learned by now \u2014 after devastating hurricanes and the Las Vegas massacre \u2014 that Americans expect their president to step forward with empathy and resolve in moments of national trauma. Yet Trump has offered no more than a few perfunctory words about the Wine Country fires that have left at least 40 dead, consumed thousands of structures and stretched the physical and mental mettle of the dedicated firefighters and medical professionals to the edge of exhaustion. On Tuesday, before welcoming the Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins, Trump said he had spoken with Gov. Jerry Brown and that the federal government would stand with the \u201cpeople of California and be there with you in this time of terrible tragedy and need.\u201d That\u2019s it? No talk of visiting California? No expressions of appreciation for the first responders? No condolences for those who lost their lives, or the many more who lost their homes? No recognition or pledges of federal support for the monumental task of rebuilding the neighborhoods and business that were devoured in the fire? Then again, how much is a Trump pledge worth, anyway? His typically rapid-fire succession of tweets this week included some that seemed to blame Puerto Rico for its post-hurricane financial crisis and a warning that \u201cWe cannot keep FEMA, the Military  ; the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!\u201d This is a president who views tweets as his primary means of connecting with the people, without the media filter he loathes. Dare we suggest that forcing NFL players to stand for the national anthem \u2014 to name one of his recent obsessions \u2014 is not a life-and-death situation. The fires are. And how many times has Trump tweeted about the fires since they were whipped by winds into life-threatening force early Monday: zero. Among the subjects that have merited a Trump tweet since then: \u2022Oh, that NFL anthem issue (in which he falsely characterized the commissioner\u2019s position; Roger Goodell did not demand that players stand). \u2022A threat to revoke the licenses of broadcast networks that have become (in his view) too \u201cpartisan, distorted and fake\u201d (though there is no federal licensing of broadcast networks). Related Stories \u2022A promotion for his obsequious interview by his Fox News pal Sean Hannity. \u2022A false claim that the New York Times set up \u201cLiddle Bob Corker\u201d by recording its interview with the Republican senator from Tennessee. In fact, Corker had consented to the recording. \u2022Praise for a flattering new book about him. \u2022A false claim that the NFL is \u201cgetting massive tax breaks\u201d while its players disrespect the flag, anthem and country. In fact, the league voluntarily relinquished its tax-exempt status two years ago. \u2022A boast: \u201cNobody could have done what I\u2019ve done for #Puerto Rico with so little appreciation.\u201d \u2022More self-congratulation: \u201cSuch a wonderful statement from the great @LouDobbs (of Fox Business Network) \u2018We take up what may be the most accomplished presidency in modern American history.\u2019\u201d So how can it be that the loss of 40 human beings on American soil did not merit a single tweet? The most forgiving interpretation would be that Trump, along with the cable networks that seem to attract his laser focus and have not made this a huge story, have a case of disaster fatigue. Perhaps the problem is that he hasn\u2019t been blasted for his underwhelming response:There is no surer way to provoke him to his phone. The most cynical speculation would be that he could not care less about a state that despises him like no other. Devastated California awaits your leadership, Mr. President. Tweet up, if you care.

{"text":"We are all antifa: Hundreds of people attend a gathering in Berkeley on Aug. 27, in response to a planned right-wing rally that was canceled. Last month, thousands gathered in San Francisco and Berkeley to defeat the hatred of fascism and white supremacy. A united front of labor, clergy, students, socialists, anarchists and others successfully prevented the fascists from holding their rallies. This is antifa \u2014 a broad movement of people who stand against the violence of white supremacists and fascists, violence emboldened by the ascendancy of Donald Trump to the presidency. Despite our victory, Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin called for antifa to be classified as a criminal gang. The lesson here is that we cannot depend on the government to meaningfully intervene and prevent the rise of fascism. That is up to us. The National Lawyers Guild, an organization of thousands of lawyers, law students and legal workers across the country, has supported free speech and assembly for all progressive and radical movements for 80 years. But The Chronicle\u2019s coverage of the Aug. 27 rally would have you believe that it is the \u201calt-right\u201d that seeks to protect speech. This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Here are some examples of what the far right does when no one is filming: \u2022Our volunteer attorneys, legal workers and clients have received death threats and their personal information publicized to promote harassment, as a result of our defense of antifa activists; \u2022One attorney was stalked inside the courthouse by a man with a swastika tattoo and a shaved head wearing quasi-military-type attire. He then left, and shortly thereafter she received threatening messages and had to seek protection at a safe house; \u2022A group of men wearing military-like attire, and one with a swastika tattoo, was seen waiting outside Santa Rita Jail for arrestees to be released; \u2022National Lawyers Guild phone lines have been inundated with hate calls. But we are prepared to defend ourselves, and are implementing security plans to ensure the safety of our members, allies and partners. This is hatred and violence, not speech. As an antiracist organization, we refuse to support white supremacists. That does not mean that we oppose free speech. We believe far-right extremists have successfully twisted the right to free speech to cast themselves as victims of exactly what they strive to promote \u2014 hate and violence. The far right, however, is not the only problem. The government appears to be colluding with the far right to target antifa. Of six protesters held overnight in jail, only one has been charged with a crime \u2014 a woman with a service dog who was brutally pinned to the ground by police, allegedly for throwing an apple. Another was arrested for allegedly pulling their T-shirt over part of their face when photographed by fascists. This campaign to recast antifa as a violent, leftist suppression of speech is a dangerous effort eerily reminiscent of the left-baiting that accompanied the Nazi rise to power. The National Lawyers Guild won\u2019t stand by as fascists and white supremacists seek to take power in the streets and halls of government. We stand in solidarity with all who fight hatred. We will continue to show up, to defend activists who challenge fascism, and we call on all people of conscience to do the same. Nina Farnia is the president of the National Lawyers Guild \u2014 San Francisco Bay Area Chapter. Rachel Lederman is chair of the Demonstrations Committee, National Lawyers Guild San Francisco Bay Area Chapter. Meredith Wallis is a member of the Demonstrations Committee.","label":1}
{"text":"Man spits feces at officers, prompting highway closure: Police arrested a man who allegedly defecated, then ate and spit his feces at officers in Richmond. (Courtesy Richmond Police Department) A wanted man who was arrested last week in Richmond allegedly became combative and then defecated, ate his feces and spat it at officers in a police car while being transported to a county jail, forcing authorities to shut down a highway, police said. According to Richmond police in a Facebook post Monday, officers responded to the North Richmond area around 6:30 p.m. on July 17 on a report of a possible wanted person. When officers arrived and detained the suspect, he allegedly gave a false name. When the suspect learned there was an arrest warrant for that person, he gave officers his real name, police said. Officers learned he also had a warrant out for his arrest and he was taken into custody, police said. At the Richmond Police Department, officers learned the suspect was also on parole. According to police, the suspect allegedly became uncooperative and combative with officers during the booking process. As a result, police decided to drive him to the county jail in Martinez. While in the back seat of a police car, the suspect allegedly slipped his cuffed hands from behind him to his front. He then removed his clothing and dropped them through a window and onto the highway. The suspect then allegedly defecated and began to eat his feces, which he then spat at the officers, police said. The officers immediately pulled the vehicle over on Interstate Highway 80 and called for assistance. Additional officers arrived to help place the suspect into a compliance safety device, police said. California Highway Patrol officers helped shut down the freeway to ensure safety of the officers and the suspect. Once the suspect was safely secured, he was taken to the county jail, police said. His name was not immediately released. No one was injured and the officers involved were cleared of any biohazards, police said. Sponsored","label":0}
{"text":"Winner but for Weiners: Saul Loeb\/Getty Images Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin arrive for a NATO foreign minister family photo in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on April 14, 2011. On Friday, the FBI announced that it had found a few new Hillary Clinton emails to investigate. Since then, many have mused that if Clinton loses this bonkers election, she\u2019ll have been blocked from the presidency by a bunch of dicks. Bill Maher suggested that Clinton\u2019s political future will be decided by \u201c out of control cocks,\u201d aka the genitals (and the brains that govern the genitals) of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and Anthony Weiner, the ever-sexting husband of Clinton\u2019s right-hand aide Huma Abedin. Likewise, Trump lackey Wayne Allyn Root gleefully imagined Clinton and Abedin committing suicide in the manner of the final scene of Thelma  ; Louise, remarking that \u201cHillary and Huma have been done in by a leaking wiener.\u201d The FBI found the latest Clinton emails during its investigation of Weiner\u2019s alleged sexual messages to a 15-year-old, so there was no avoiding the puns that followed. For Root and many other Trump supporters, the sight of two ambitious women being cock-blocked from power by a man\u2019s dick pics was no doubt a pleasant reflection of the imagery of sexual violence they\u2019ve invoked throughout the campaign. \u201cHillary sucks, but not like Monica,\u201d these fellows said. \u201cTrump that bitch,\u201d they said. \u201cPut Hillary\u2019s face on a blow-up doll,\u201d they said. Now, it seems possible that the first woman to beat back a lifetime of sexist attacks all the way to the door of the Oval Office might be thwarted in the final push by the misogyny and sexual predations of three lecherous men. Granted, the most recent FBI email thing has made a tiny dent in Clinton\u2019s poll numbers. There\u2019s no need to expedite that visa to Canada. But there\u2019s no getting around the fact that Weiner\u2019s unwillingness to curb his sexting habit has harmed his wife\u2019s career and Clinton\u2019s shot at the presidency. Trump has used Weiner\u2019s ill-advised (and potentially criminal) sexts to cast doubt on Clinton\u2019s judgment in hiring a woman who married a compulsive virtual cheat. Bill Clinton has been an undeniable liability to his wife\u2019s campaign, both because of his unpredictable outbursts and his history of infidelity and alleged sexual assault. The Trump train has used Bill\u2019s past to pick away at Hillary\u2019s commitment to gender equality and embarrass her by trotting out Bill\u2019s accusers, who have credible claims against Bill but not Hillary, at every opportunity. Remember when Newt Gingrich attempted to force Megyn Kelly to say the phrase \u201c Bill Clinton, sexual predator\u201d? That was stupid, but wouldn\u2019t it have been nice if Bill had just been a good person and not done anything wrong, sexually, so hypocrites like Gingrich wouldn\u2019t have had any ammunition in the first place? Then there\u2019s Trump, whose entire worldview is projected through the warped lens of misogyny. That is undoubtedly why women of all political stripes have turned against him, and why some Republican women are starting to have broader misgivings about their party at large. But it\u2019s also why many men, and probably some delusional women, love him. It\u2019s one of the characteristics that makes him a politically incorrect straight-shooter, an everyman who says what he thinks, a symbol of unapologetically toxic, hostile masculinity that a certain chunk of voters love so much that they\u2019d vote for an anthropomorphized jockstrap before electing a woman to the presidency. Trump\u2019s misogyny is an integral part of his appeal; if Clinton loses, misogyny\u2014Trump\u2019s particular brand of misogyny, not just the misogyny of the modern electorate\u2014will be partially to blame. And so we, the women of America, find ourselves watching in horror and rage as the repulsive sexual behavior of three pathetic men threatens to obstruct the election of a supremely capable first female president and her equally brilliant No. 2. It would be an extraordinary feat of poetic injustice if the most qualified female presidential candidate in history got within a nose hair\u2019s breadth of the office just to be thwarted by a trio of men who\u2019ve disrespected their marriages and prioritized their own sexual proclivities over their wives\u2019 careers and ambitions. The issue here is not whether the emails Weiner inadvertently revealed are of legitimate concern\u2014compared to anything Trump has ever done, they\u2019re not. The issue is not whether women should be punished for their husband\u2019s sins (they shouldn\u2019t). It\u2019s that people are using those emails and those sexual misdeeds to cast Clinton and Abedin as power-hungry schemers who overlooked their husbands\u2019 moral failings to get ahead. Or worse, to paraphrase the favored Trumpkin narrative, frigid wives whose sharp elbows keep them from properly satisfying their husbands. These narratives persist not because successful, ambitious women keep making poor decisions about their mates. (Still, Huma\u2014glad you finally realized you didn\u2019t need your joke of a husband.) They continue to stymie the ascension of some of our best political minds because too many men are careless, insecure egomaniacs who engage in malicious deceits of their families and constituents. Clinton and Abedin\u2019s current situation is the perfect allegory for the politics of misogyny and the misogyny of politics in America. This is a magnified version of every time a man has stunted a woman\u2019s career to satisfy his own base desires; every time a man has chosen to harm his wife and his marriage in some pitiful attempt to shore up his fragile ego; every time a man has made dumbass decisions to suit only himself, not caring whether or how he might fundamentally alter the courses of others\u2019 lives for the worse. If one were prone to conspiracy theories, one might wonder whether all the world\u2019s grossest men collaborated on a generationlong plan to keep the first viable female candidate out of the West Wing. (This author is not prone to such theories but encourages those who are to send her the receipts and we\u2019ll talk.) Or the three-sexually-predatory-men vs. Clinton setup might be just the plot device we need to make a Clinton victory an even more cathartic triumph over the hundreds of years of U.S. politics working against women who seek power. But here\u2019s the sad reality: The sexual predations of those three nasty men have about a 1 in 4 chance of delivering the presidency to Donald \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d Trump. On Saturday Night Live, just after Trump earned that moniker with the release of the Access Hollywood recording, Michael Che advised \u201cold, rich white dudes\u201d to \u201calways assume you\u2019re being recorded.\u201d I\u2019d add this: Imagine how you\u2019ll feel when your sexts and extramarital affairs end American democracy as we know it.","label":1}
{"text":"Voters Want Hillary Clinton to be the Grown-Up: Carolyn Cole\/Getty Images Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Donald Trump take part in a debate at the University of Miami on March 10. An awful lot of very knowledgeable people have been giving Hillary Clinton advice, both solicited and less solicited, as she prepares to square off against Donald Trump in the first general-election debate on Monday. People are apparently expecting this contest to be a difficult one for the former secretary of state. This piece by James Fallows, for example, is a must-read explication of why Trump is both good at television and also a formidable liar (which can make him seem like a good debater). But Clinton has an incredible debate prep team, and by all accounts she is preparing as she does for everything: meticulously. The press tells us that these debates will be a pivotal moment in the campaign; a chance to show those undecided and on-the-fencers what a Clinton presidency might mean, or more emphatically, what a Trump presidency could look like. One demonstrably silly media narrative is Clinton must show the country that she is not a liar and Trump must show that\u2014while he is an affront to human dignity and intellect\u2014he is capable of making it through a debate without disgracing himself. So, a totally level playing field! As a former debater myself, I did feel like there is one useful area of focus for Clinton that hasn\u2019t been adequately covered by the media: She will be debating an asshole. There has been much rumination on how challenging it will be for her to debate someone who has no policy positions, and doesn\u2019t know stuff. We worry about the double standard around her clothes and voice. There has been a good deal of throat-clutching over the possibility that he will goad her into losing her cool. But it seems to me the real challenge for Clinton is that she must stand on a stage and debate the single most awful political person in modern American consciousness. Trying to stifle the impulse just to walk across the stage and belt him in the face would seem an insurmountable task. Add to that the fact that Clinton is expected to speak and listen, and it seems beyond human capability. When considering these obstacles, Clinton should realize that she has one sole job in these debates: Be the grown-up. She doesn\u2019t need to be funny. ( She isn\u2019t.) She doesn\u2019t need to be emotional\u2014that\u2019s how the deeply unfortunate \u201c basket of deplorables\u201d remark happened. She doesn\u2019t have to bend over backward to be charming or personable. Her job is to ignore the crazy circus monkey with the broken cymbals and do what she does best: Listen carefully, respond reasonably, and speak to the part of America that truly understands what it means to entrust someone with the nuclear codes. That is not the America of violent stadium rallies or the America of alt-right chatrooms. For purposes of the debates, even the bare acknowledgement of their world is demeaning. Clinton needs to realize that the split screen is not just a TV device; it reflects the ways in which these two will be appearing on two wholly different programs. She needs to stay off Trump\u2019s show. On his show, he always wins. If, though, she can imagine herself back in Victorian England when children were still largely ignored\u2014even if they were wearing miniaturized adult clothing\u2014she\u2019s on the right track. Too many Americans have been sickened and saddened and dispirited by this campaign. A lot of them are tuning in only now, only reluctantly, to try to clarify what the hell we have become over the course of this past year. The one thing we all need to see, I believe, is that there is even an adult menu available, not just the chicken fingers and the grilled cheese. We need to see absolute sobriety and seriousness, and any effort to engage with the orange whirlwind of self-regard will only be a distraction. Hillary needs to imagine herself back in Victorian England when children were still largely ignored\u2014even if they were wearing miniaturized adult clothing. That brings us to the baskets. The fact that the racists, misogynists, and bigots have not just come out of the woodwork to support Trump but have indeed become his reinforced load-bearing walls is apparently not to be spoken aloud. Racists, misogynists, and bigots, it seems, are the next big social movement in America. No belittling them. So, Clinton needs to ignore them. She needs not to scold them. If asked about them, she needs to respectfully suggest that this is Trump\u2019s problem, not hers. Adults don\u2019t call voters names, even the bigots. Nobody will be tuning in this week to discover what Hillary Clinton thinks of them anyhow. They want to figure out what they think of her. So here\u2019s the great news: Everything Clinton needs to do involve skills she has in spades. She is an adult. She is an expert. She can talk about policy in frightening detail. She isn\u2019t an entertainer, or a pastor, or a porn star. That\u2019s all to the good. There is no doubt whatsoever that anyone tuning in Monday to be amused, or cuddled, or fake-understood, will find her robotic and probably even cold. People, as it turns out, really like porn stars. But anyone who wants to see, for the first time since the primaries, how fully realized adult humans speak, think, and behave, will want to see that Clinton, the one Michelle Obama promised would \u201cgo high\u201d no matter what lows are being imposed upon us all. Not one word should be uttered by the former secretary of state that would not have been spoken in public by Winston Churchill, or a four-star general, or Abraham Lincoln. If that means resisting the temptation to launch zingers or references to the breakup of Angelina and Brad, so be it. Whatever party they may prefer, Americans are terrified right now. They are terrified of violence, and racial strife, and ISIS, and\u2014I\u2019d suspect\u2014most Americans are terrified of what this race has done to presidential elections. Steadiness and sanity may not make for great reality television. But the other alternative does not make for very great reality. Hillary Clinton was probably born an earnest, sober middle-aged woman. Donald Trump was born a toddler and doesn\u2019t appear to have moved up much along the developmental charts. She needs to have the confidence to understand that Americans are able and willing to reckon with the difference between the two.","label":1}
{"text":"The Real Donald Trump: Dominick Reuter\/AFP\/Getty Images Donald Trump and Mike Pence, one of his many Republican supporters. For months now, Hillary Clinton has occasionally been using some version of this Maya Angelou quote when she discusses Donald Trump on the campaign trail: \u201cWhen someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.\u201d This is usually followed by some variation on another line Clinton used at the Democratic National Convention in July: \u201cThere is no other Donald Trump. This is it.\u201d After months of controversies over Trump\u2019s personal attacks on women, his racist talk about an American judge of Mexican heritage, his casual slurs of immigrants and a Muslim American Gold Star family, and countless other controversies, it seemed as though the folks who were determined to back Trump saw and understood perfectly well who he was and had accepted it. More maddening, it seemed they just didn\u2019t care. That\u2019s why, when the story broke on Friday that Donald Trump was caught on a live mic bragging about how he could kiss women\u2014and grab their genitals\u2014without their consent because he was famous, I initially wondered what the news was. Was there anyone alive surprised here? Voters have watched Trump joyfully trash and objectify women for more than a year. Republicans and their leaders have been offered evidence of Trump as an unrepentant pig since the primaries began. His supporters have tolerated his rampant sexism, xenophobia, threats of violence and lawlessness, and so much more. So why should talk of grabbing a woman\u2019s pussy with impunity become the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back? As Clinton has suggested, often with great frustration, Trump has been showing us who he really is for months, if not years. Here\u2019s the reason it really did become the last straw, why so many Republican politicians who had previously supported Trump are now either renouncing their support or calling for him to drop out (by Saturday afternoon it was more than a dozen). Historically, all these Republicans could actually pretend Trump was just kidding; they could deny that Trump was who everyone knew that he was. Consider Trump\u2019s running mate Mike Pence\u2019s debate performance on Wednesday, where he spent most of his time simply asserting that Trump had never said and done so many of the horrible things he had said and done. Using this logic\u2014He doesn\u2019t really mean all these horrible things, he\u2019s a performer not a polished politician, you are misinterpreting what he said\u2014they could cover for him indefinitely. The groping tape is different, it reveals both the real Trump and the performer Trump, and it turns out the former is actually scarier than the latter. Partly it\u2019s because we clearly hear a new version of Trump\u2019s voice on the tape. Yes, his standard swaggering tone\u2014so incredibly familiar at this point\u2014is present. But in this tape he\u2019s not bragging at us in a way he wants us to hear. It\u2019s startling because it\u2019s both perfectly recognizable and perfectly novel in its utter grotesqueness. Partly it\u2019s the coarseness, the glowing pride he takes in acts of sexual violence, that makes this feel different from even the worst comments he has made in the past. But the real reason Trump\u2019s \u201cpussy\u201d comments may prove to be the death knell for the nominee\u2014and have led so many in his own party to abandon him already\u2014is that it definitively proves the truth about the things Trump says: Contrary to his repeated claims and his boosters\u2019 hopes, these words aren\u2019t just \u201c jokes\u201d or him playing a role as an \u201c entertainer.\u201d These words are who he really is. There is no hiding from that now. What changed with Friday\u2019s video revelation is that Trump has been caught in the perfect duality of a born performer: On the bus with Billy Bush, he\u2019s the braggart, the player, the one who cares only about tits and his score sheet\u2014 a woman\u2019s physical autonomy and the law itself be damned. The tape lets us see what happens when the cameras come on and the woman he had been describing as an amalgam of legs, purple, and hotness becomes an actual human person, as he switches to performance mode. We watch his face shift into his entertainer mask, we hear his voice soften and witness his fake avuncular performance. He greets his costar for the day\u2014the soap opera actress Arianne Zucker\u2014with a manly, almost distracted \"oh, hello, how are you, hi\u2026\" made all the more vile by what we\u2019ve just heard\u2014the real Donald Trump talking as if he was ordering talent off the porno menu. It\u2019s not just, as Jessica Valenti points out, that Arianne Zucker is the punchline to Trump and Bush\u2019s ugly joke. It\u2019s that she is the unknowing witness to the performance of professional civility in a man who just finished arming himself with Tic Tacs in case he felt himself compelled to sexually assault her for the crime of being an attractive woman. The reason the video may prove to be the last gasp for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is that it inverts the story he\u2019s been telling us all along: that the sexism, the skirt-chasing, the jolly recreational objectification of young girls and women is just a persona he affects for the cameras. Now we are offered incontrovertible proof of the truth we could never force his supporters to acknowledge: The monstrous woman-hater is actually the person under the performer. The stark contrast between the story he\u2019s been selling about which part of his life was staged and which part is real is finally revealed. Even for those who have suspected it all along, the fact that Trump hasn\u2019t been just playing a pig, but actually is one, is shocking to hear and see. For those who would deny that reality, this tape makes the task of defending him all but impossible. Anyone who stands with the real Trump now\u2014the Trump who thinks that furniture is foreplay and that women are basically just furniture\u2014will never be able to hide from that fact again. \"That\u2019s why, when the story broke on Friday that Donald Trump was caught on a live mic bragging about how he could kiss women\u2014and grab their genitals\u2014without their consent because he was famous, I initially wondered what the news was.

Donald Trump says he\u2019ll protect America from its enemies. He\u2019ll build a wall on the Mexican border, block Muslim refugees, and slap tariffs on China. But Trump\u2019s latest threats against Muslim Americans, like his attacks on the \u201c Mexican\u201d judge in the Trump University fraud case, show that these assaults won\u2019t stop at the border. Trump is now targeting natural-born citizens of the United States, treating them as aliens based on religion or ethnicity. He\u2019s not building walls around America. He\u2019s building walls within it. When Trump went after Judge Gonzalo Curiel three weeks ago, calling him biased and underhanded because of his \u201c heritage,\u201d many Americans cried foul. It\u2019s one thing to campaign against illegal immigration or even legal immigration, they noted. It\u2019s quite another to challenge someone born in this country based on his ancestry. The massacre in Orlando on June 12, awful as it was, gave Trump an opportunity to change the subject and mend his ways. Instead, he continued\u2014and broadened\u2014his line of attack. He insinuated that Muslim Americans, like Mexican Americans, were disloyal. \u201cSince 9\/11, hundreds of migrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism in the United States,\u201d Trump declared in a statement hours after the massacre. \u201cHillary Clinton wants to dramatically increase admissions from the Middle East, bringing in many hundreds of thousands during a first term\u2014and we will have no way to screen them, pay for them, or prevent the second generation from radicalizing.\u201d \u201cTheir children.\u201d \u201cThe second generation.\u201d Trump wasn\u2019t just arguing, as he had in the past, that the refugees couldn\u2019t be vetted. He was claiming that even if they were vetted, they still had to be kept out of the country, because their offspring might someday become terrorists. This scenario would take place in the future, possibly involving children who were not yet born and influences from abroad that might reach these children without their parents\u2019 knowledge. Therefore, no migrant, regardless of vetting, was safe to admit.  Under the Clinton plan, you\u2019d be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them or to prevent the radicalization of the children\u2014and their children. Not only their children, by the way. They\u2019re trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS is and how wonderful Islam is.  Now Trump was talking about a third generation. If the children of migrants didn\u2019t become terrorists, their grandchildren might. And even if none of them did, Muslims were still too dangerous to allow into the country, because they or their descendants might try to tell non-Muslim kids \u201chow wonderful Islam is.\u201d Trump conceded that the killer in Orlando, like the male shooter in San Bernardino, had been born in the United States. But he emphasized that their parents, respectively, were from Afghanistan and Pakistan. He also pointed to the Boston Marathon bombers, whose parents had come from Central Asia. He used these cases to justify a ban not only on Afghans and Pakistanis, but on refugees from Syria, who had committed none of these crimes. In a Fox News interview after the speech, Bill O\u2019Reilly challenged Trump\u2019s inference. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t any linkage that I can find, or the FBI can find, between refugees \u2026 women and children, primarily, coming here\u2014and violence,\u201d said O\u2019Reilly. But Trump conceded nothing. \u201cI don\u2019t think you know about linkage yet,\u201d he told O\u2019Reilly. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen two years from now? What\u2019s going to happen 10 years from now?\u201d Trump went on: \u201cLook at the Boston bombers. \u2026 Their family came here. And they weren\u2019t radical when they were 6, 7 years old. And all of a sudden, they blew people up.\u201d The next day, June 14, Trump escalated his assault. \u201cThe children of Muslim immigrant parents\u2014they\u2019re responsible for a growing number \u2026 of terrorist attacks,\u201d he declared at a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina. He continued: \u201cEvery year we bring in more than 100,000 lifetime immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside of the Middle East. A number of these immigrants have hostile attitudes.\u201d As an example of hostile attitudes, Trump\u2014who had warmly addressed an anti-gay Christian group just before the Orlando attack\u2014cited Muslim opposition to homosexuality. Trump depicted Muslims, regardless of terrorism, as a cultural threat. In a Fox News interview after the Greensboro speech, Sean Hannity asked Trump: \u201cHow do we vet somebody\u2019s heart and ascertain if they\u2019re coming here for freedom, or if they want to proselytize, indoctrinate, and bring their theocracy with them?\u201d Trump replied: \u201cAssimilation has been very hard. It\u2019s almost\u2014I won\u2019t say nonexistent, but it gets to be pretty close. And I\u2019m talking about second and third generation. They don\u2019t\u2014for some reason, there\u2019s no real assimilation. And you see it all over the place.\u201d Since then, Trump has repeated his warnings about American-born Muslims and their children. On Wednesday, at a rally in Atlanta, he repeated his call for an immigration ban, noting that the Orlando killer \u201c was born here, but his parents weren\u2019t.\u201d Afterward, Trump told Greta Van Susteren: \u201cThe second generation\u2014if you look at this, and I\u2019ve done actually a pretty good study on it\u2014the second generation can be as violent or more violent than the first.\u201d On Wednesday, in a prepared speech, he warned again of the terror threat from \u201c recent immigrants and their children.\u201d That\u2019s how Trump sees the United States. If your ancestors came from Europe, as Trump\u2019s mother did, you\u2019re American. Trump\u2019s attacks on Latino, Arab, and Muslim Americans predate San Bernardino, and they extend from crime to sheer otherness. Last September, he criticized Jeb Bush for speaking Spanish. \u201cTo assimilate, you have to speak English,\u201d Trump insisted during a Republican debate. \u201cWe have to have assimilation to have a country.\u201d In November, at a rally in Birmingham, Alabama, Trump called for a package deal: a wall on the Mexican border and a database to track Muslims in the United States. He asserted, without evidence, that \u201c large Arab populations\u201d in New Jersey\u2014\u201cthousands and thousands of people\u201d\u2014had cheered on 9\/11 when the World Trade Center collapsed. And he vowed to expel \u201canchor babies\u201d who had been born in the United States to Mexican parents. Trump has targeted people of other ethnicities as well. He questioned the religious integrity of Sen. Ted Cruz, citing Cruz\u2019s Cuban ancestry. He disputed Cruz\u2019s eligibility for the presidency on the grounds that Cruz, despite his mother\u2019s American citizenship, was born in Canada. Trump has also challenged President Obama\u2019s legitimacy, claiming that Obama was \u201c born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia\u201d and might be a Muslim. Last week, Trump suggested that Obama, in the face of Islamic terrorism, isn\u2019t protecting America because he \u201c has something else in mind.\u201d When Trump goes after Obama\u2019s or Cruz\u2019s place of birth, he\u2019s challenging their legal status. But when he goes after their heritage or religion, he\u2019s doing something subtler. It\u2019s the same thing Trump has done to Curiel and to American Muslims: He\u2019s attacking the second generation. He\u2019s also appealing to white suspicions that minorities get unfair advantages. If Obama was born in this country, says Trump, \u201c there\u2019s a very good chance\u201d that Obama pretended to be Kenyan in order to get into college and get financial aid. Trump has leveled similar accusations at Sen. Elizabeth Warren, claiming that she \u201c scammed\u201d universities by representing herself as part Cherokee. Trump routinely mocks Warren as \u201c Pocahontas\u201d and \u201c the Indian.\u201d Years ago, he questioned the authenticity of the Mashantucket Pequots, a Connecticut tribe. \u201c They don\u2019t look like Indians,\u201d said Trump. The next group on Trump\u2019s target list might be Asian Americans. In several speeches last week, he lambasted China, Japan, Vietnam, India, and South Korea, claiming that they rip off the United States in trade, take American jobs, and don\u2019t pay us enough for military protection. That sounds a lot like Trump\u2019s beefs against Mexico, which he later invoked as a reason to accuse Curiel of \u201c inherent\u201d bias against him. Last fall, after Trump spoke in New Hampshire, a college student tried to ask him about his allegations against South Korea. The student, a Texas-born Korean American dressed in a Harvard sweatshirt, spoke in perfect, accent-free English. But before he could get his question out\u2014and endure Trump\u2019s subsequent rant against South Korea and Japan\u2014Trump interrupted him with a question of his own: \u201cAre you from South Korea?\u201d The vast majority of legal immigrants are more patriotic toward the USA than confederate flag waving scum republicans. Love it or leave it. More... That\u2019s how Trump sees the United States. If your ancestors came from Europe, as Trump\u2019s mother did, you\u2019re American. If they came from Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, or Asia, you\u2019re only provisionally American. When Trump wants your vote, he\u2019ll put a \u201cthe\u201d in front of your ethnicity, bragging about his relations with \u201c the blacks\u201d or \u201c the Hispanics.\u201d He\u2019ll even claim, as he did in his speech on Wednesday, that his anti-immigrant policies would help American minorities. But deep down, when there\u2019s political advantage to be gained by dividing and scapegoating, Trump doesn\u2019t believe in American minorities. If you\u2019re a minority, you and your descendants will always be on probation. Don\u2019t forget it.","label":1}
{"text":"Trump\u2019s Response to Orlando Is Exactly What ISIS Wants: Jeff Swensen\/Getty Images Donald Trump arrives in his plane to speak to supporters at a rally on Saturday at Atlantic Aviation in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. Donald Trump says the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida\u2014perpetrated early Sunday morning by an Afghan American who\u2019d pledged allegiance to ISIS\u2014vindicates Trump\u2019s hard line against ISIS and terrorism. In a tweet posted Sunday afternoon, Trump gloated that he had been proved \u201cright on radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d A few hours later, he repeated his call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. In a statement Sunday evening, Trump argued that 99 percent of Afghans were radical Islamists, that Middle Eastern migrants should be kept out of the United States, and that anyone who refused to \u201csay the words \u2018Radical Islam\u2019 \u201d in the hours after the Orlando massacre should be disqualified from the presidency. Trump is a fool. Analysts who see this atrocity as an act of radical Islamic terrorism\u2014and who understand radicalism, Islam, and terrorism far better than Trump does\u2014suspect it was inspired by a message from ISIS, issued three weeks ago. This elaborate statement, delivered by ISIS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, urged ISIS sympathizers to attack civilians in Europe and the United States during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. It also clarified the group\u2019s propaganda and recruitment strategy. Trump\u2019s platform of banning Muslims, blocking migrants, and ruthlessly bombing ISIS-held territory fits this strategy perfectly. He\u2019s an ISIS stooge. The statement from ISIS, released on May 21, exhorts Muslims to \u201cterrorize\u201d non-Muslims everywhere and to make Ramadan \u201ca month of suffering.\u201d But this plea comes from a position of weakness. The statement says \u201cthe whole world has allied and rushed against us,\u201d launching \u201c20,000 airstrikes\u201d and killing several top ISIS leaders. It pledges, defiantly and expectantly, that ISIS won\u2019t quit no matter how much territory it loses. The worst peril, according to the statement, is emerging from within Islam: \u201cEvil scholars\u201d are using \u201cevery form of media\u201d to issue \u201cfatwas against the mujahidin.\u201d These scholars, the statement explains, are promoting moderate interpretations of Islamic mercy. They\u2019re denouncing terrorism and condemning ISIS fighters as pseudo-Islamic \u201crenegades.\u201d They\u2019re instructing Muslims to renounce jihad and expel ISIS from their lands. For pages and pages, the statement goes on, lambasting these scholars and the damage they\u2019re doing to public opinion. Clearly, ISIS sees this as a central threat. To quash the threat, ISIS reasserts that \u201cthere are only two armies, two camps, two trenches\u201d: Muslims and infidels. There can be no integration, the statement argues\u2014no attempt to \u201c \u2018make peace and mix\u2019 with those who hate the faith.\u201d Muslims must follow ISIS: \u201cWe are the People of the Quran.\u201d The statement claims that the armies arrayed against ISIS \u201cwage war against us \u2026 because we command the worship of Allah. \u2026 This is our religion. For this alone, we fight the world and they fight us.\u201d To prove that the forces arrayed against ISIS are anti-Islamic, and to justify terrorism in Europe and the United States, the statement presents three arguments. First, it says the West doesn\u2019t care about the thousands of Syrian Muslims slaughtered by Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime. Contrary to our rhetoric about human rights, we\u2019ve ignored Assad\u2019s:  barrels of death, destruction, and gas. America and its allies do not ache and feel pain, except when [ISIS fighters] advance and gain victories. The world does not weep at the Russian and [Assad] massacres each day against the Muslims. \u2026 The people of Europe and other lands of [unbelievers] do not shudder at the Russian destruction of hospitals.  Second, the statement accuses us of indifference to Syrians who have fled their homes. \u201cThe sentiments in Europe, America, and other disbelieving nations are not moved nor shaken by the displacement of millions,\u201d ISIS argues. \u201cThey are not disturbed by the hunger, disease, suffering, and death of thousands of helpless and besieged children, women, and elderly people.\u201d Third, ISIS says it\u2019s OK to kill civilians in non-Muslim countries, because that\u2019s what we do in Muslim countries. The statement instructs ISIS sympathizers abroad:  It has reached us that some of you do not act due to their incapacity to reach military targets, or their finding fault with targeting those who are called \u201ccivilians.\u201d So they [avoid] harming them, doubting the permissibility thereof. Know that inside the lands of the belligerent crusaders, there is no sanctity of blood and no existence of those called \u201cinnocents.\u201d \u2026 [T]heir warplanes do not distinguish between one who is armed and another who is unarmed, nor between a man and a woman.  On each of these three points, Trump\u2019s rhetoric and agenda support ISIS. Trump backs Russia and Assad in their ruthless assaults on rebellious Syrian population centers. He calls for a \u201c complete shutdown\u201d of migration to the United States, specifically aimed at Muslims. He pledges to \u201c bomb the shit\u201d out of ISIS-held territory and loosen restraints on airstrikes that might kill civilians. He even advocates targeting the family members of terrorists, regardless of their innocence. Trump also reinforces ISIS\u2019s message that the campaign against it is a war against Islam. His ban on entry to the United States would apply to all Muslims, not just to radicals or supporters of terrorism. Three months ago, Trump declared that \u201c Islam hates us\u201d and refused to distinguish radical Muslims from Muslims in general, arguing that \u201cit's very hard to separate because you don't know who is who.\u201d On Friday, just before the Orlando attack, he told an audience of conservative Christians that he would \u201cdefend Christian Americans\u201d and clamp down on the influx of \u201c Syrian refugees.\u201d In short, Trump would undercut everything that\u2019s working against ISIS: Muslim governments that have joined our military campaign, clerics who are articulating moderate Islam, ministries and activists who are working online to discredit jihadism. He would help ISIS obtain the weapons it needs most: overseas recruits who are willing to kill people in their own countries. He would make another Orlando more likely. Trump thinks his policy of \u201c vigilance\u201d against domestic Muslims would protect us. But that, too, serves the enemy\u2019s agenda. In its Ramadan message, ISIS urged its sympathizers in the West to wage jihad in their own countries, \u201cto make examples of the crusaders, day and night, scaring them and terrorizing them, until every neighbor fears his neighbor.\u201d That\u2019s the purpose of the attacks in Fort Hood, Boston, San Bernardino, and Orlando: to terrorize us, to polarize us, to make every neighbor fear his neighbor. So far, the terrorists haven\u2019t succeeded. But Trump might.","label":1}
{"text":"The Most Damning Speech of the GOP Convention: Photo by Robyn Beck\/AFP\/Getty Images Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani shrieks at delegates during the evening session of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. The 2016 Republican National Convention is a marvel of cognitive dissonance. It seems to have been constructed as though Republicans were nominating a normal presidential candidate. But they aren\u2019t. We keep hearing that the nominee stands for this or has said that\u2014but he doesn\u2019t, and he hasn\u2019t. He\u2019s outside the bounds of presentable behavior. So the party, in its presentation, ignores his record. Take Monday\u2019s speech by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Like previous speakers, he complained that President Obama has failed to identify \u201cour enemy.\u201d Giuliani described this enemy as \u201cIslamic extremist terrorism.\u201d Then he paused to lecture reporters: \u201cFor the purpose of the media, I did not say all of Islam. I did not say most of Islam. I said Islamic extremist terrorism.\u201d Well, that\u2019s nice. But it\u2019s not what Trump has said. Trump has said, \u201c Islam hates us.\u201d He has proposed a \u201c complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d If you don\u2019t like that position, don\u2019t lecture the press. Lecture your nominee. \u201cDonald Trump is a leader,\u201d Giuliani went on. \u201cHe will reassert America\u2019s position as the nation with the best values to lead the world.\u201d Really? Trump will show we have the best values to lead the world? Maybe a Republican speaker could have said that about George W. Bush, who at least claimed to fight for democracy. But Trump? Trump\u2019s whole foreign policy is about renouncing values. He says our scruples weaken us in the fight against ISIS. He says we should torture prisoners for sheer retribution. He says we should target the families of terrorists. He says we should seize oil from countries we invade. Take the Ten Commandments, turn them upside down, and that\u2019s pretty much what Trump stands for. You can argue that his foreign policy might scare some countries into bowing to us, as they do when threatened by Russia or China. But values? Please. Giuliani accused Obama of dividing the country over police shootings. He asked: \u201cWhat happened to \u2018There's no black America, no white America, there is just America\u2019?\u201d Speaking for the GOP, Giuliani pledged: \u201cWe reach out our arms with understanding and compassion to those who have lost loved ones because of police shootings.\u201d That\u2019s sweet. But maybe, before issuing that pledge, Giuliani should have checked Trump\u2019s Twitter account. He could start with Trump\u2019s tweet that \u201c the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics.\u201d Then perhaps he could move on to Trump\u2019s retweet of a fabricated claim that 81 percent of white homicide victims were killed by blacks\u2014followed by Trump\u2019s insistence that the number came \u201c from sources that are very credible.\u201d Then maybe he could peruse Trump\u2019s tweets about the anger over policing in Ferguson, Missouri (\u201c President Obama has absolutely no control [or respect] over the African American community\u201d) and over the death of Freddie Gray (\u201c Our great African American President hasn\u2019t exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!\u201d). And for dessert, he could read Trump\u2019s remark, just three weeks ago, that sportscaster Jimmy \u201cthe Greek\u201d Snyder never should have apologized for racist comments about black athletes. There\u2019s no black America, except in everything Trump says to white America. Giuliani accused the press of misrepresenting Trump:  This is a man with a big heart who loves people. All people, from the top to the bottom, from the middle to the side. I'm telling you this because I'm sick and tired of the defamation of Donald Trump by the media and by the Clinton campaign. I'm sick and tired of it!  Defamation? Rudy, Rudy. Do you not have Internet? Have you ever watched a video of Trump talking? We\u2019re not his defamers. We\u2019re just his stenographers. We let him talk, and he shows everyone what\u2019s in that big heart of his. Maybe you should queue up the time he ridiculed a disabled journalist. Or the time he said a judge was unfit to hear his case because the judge was \u201c of Mexican heritage.\u201d Or the time he pined for the days when protesters would be taken out of rallies \u201c on a stretcher.\u201d And that\u2019s just a small sample of the venom that has oozed out of Trump\u2019s mouth. Here\u2019s the problem, Republicans. Three days from now, this show you\u2019re putting on will be over. All the promises made by people who aren\u2019t Donald Trump will be gone. The only thing you\u2019ll be left with is the guy you actually nominated for president. And what he has said\u2014and continues to say\u2014is so awful that you couldn\u2019t bring yourselves, in four days of talking about him, to face who he really is.","label":1}
{"text":"10 Vile Things Donald Trump Has Said Since the GOP Convention: Alex Wong\/Getty Images Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event at Briar Woods High School on Tuesday in Ashburn, Virginia. Shortly before the Republican National Convention, House Speaker Paul Ryan said he had spoken with Donald Trump several times about improving his \u201ctemperament\u201d and sounding more \u201cinclusive.\u201d In particular, Ryan said he had cautioned Trump about his attack on the ethnic heritage of a Mexican-American judge. NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep asked Ryan whether he had seen any subsequent changes in Trump\u2019s behavior. Ryan answered: \u201c I believe he\u2019s going to endeavor, to try.\u201d Nearly two weeks after the convention ended, it\u2019s clear that Trump is unreformed. It\u2019s not just his beef with the parents of a slain soldier: Trump has spurned the Constitution, ridiculed morality, and dished out ethnic, religious, and sexual slurs. As these outbursts have continued, Ryan has spoken out just once, ignoring the rest of Trump\u2019s offenses. He and other Republican leaders continue to support Trump. Here\u2019s what Trump has said and done since the convention while the GOP leadership, for the most part, has looked the other way. 1. Smearing a dead soldier\u2019s Muslim mother. During the Iraq war, U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan, a Muslim, sacrificed his life to save his fellow American soldiers. This past Thursday, Khan\u2019s father, Khizr Khan, spoke at the Democratic National Convention and pointed out that under Trump\u2019s proposed Muslim ban, Humayun Khan would not have been allowed into the United States. On Friday, Trump was asked to respond in an interview with ABC News. Trump immediately changed the subject to Khan\u2019s mother, Ghazala Khan, who had stood beside her husband during the DNC speech, wearing a hijab. \u201cShe had nothing to say,\u201d Trump pointed out. \u201cShe probably\u2014maybe she wasn\u2019t allowed to have anything to say.\u201d Trump was wrong: As Ghazala Khan explained in interviews and a Washington Post op-ed, she hadn\u2019t spoken at the convention because it\u2019s emotionally difficult for her to talk about her son\u2019s death. Trump simply assumed, based on her faith and appearance, that she was being oppressed. Presented with a Muslim man who had given his life for America, Trump focused not on the soldier\u2019s uniform but on his mother\u2019s hijab. And rather than praise Humayun Khan for thwarting a bomber, Trump shifted to a cultural critique of Muslims, the same critique Trump has been peddling since mid-June. This episode makes it clear that Trump\u2019s animus against Islam transcends the issue of terrorism. 2. Resisting religious nondiscrimination. After Trump proposed his Muslim ban in December, some Republicans warned him that discrimination on the basis of faith was un-American. They advised him to apply his immigration restrictions to countries rather than a religion. Trump is trying to comply with that advice legally, but he has signaled that he hates it and that he doesn\u2019t understand why Muslims can\u2019t be excluded as a class. In a July 24 interview on Meet the Press, Trump mocked his critics: \u201cPeople were so upset when I used the word \u2018Muslim.\u2019 Ooooh, you can\u2019t use the word \u2018Muslim.\u2019 \u201c He went on: \u201cOur Constitution is great. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily give us the right to commit suicide.\u201d Trump has since repeated that criticism of the Constitution at campaign rallies. On July 28, Fox News\u2019 Brian Kilmeade asked Trump whether he had \u201cclarified\u201d that his ban wouldn\u2019t cover all Muslims. Trump replied noncommittally: \u201c We\u2019re going to territories. We\u2019ll see.\u201d In an interview on Monday, Sean Hannity pointed out that nearly all Syrian refugees recently admitted to the United States were Muslims. He asked Trump whether this meant that U.S. officials were discriminating against Christians. Trump answered:  In my opinion, they are. But we don\u2019t take care of the Christians. You know, before the migration, a friend of mine [said that if] you come from Syria, if you\u2019re Muslim, it\u2019s one of the easiest places to come into the United States from. If you\u2019re Christian, it\u2019s impossible, virtually impossible to come into the United States. Very unfair.  It\u2019s worth pointing out that Trump, while complaining that too many Muslims are theocratic, has no problem with Jews or Christians who claim divine authority for government. At a campaign event in Roanoke, Virginia, on July 25, a questioner asked Trump: \u201c Will you stand by Israel 100 percent and do whatever it takes to preserve the nation of God?\u201c Trump, without hesitation, replied, \u201c100 percent.\u201d 3. Advocating punishment of Muslim communities. At a press conference near Miami on July 27, Trump declared Muslim neighbors and congregants responsible for terrorism in the United States. \u201cI think that the people in the community know what\u2019s going on, whether it\u2019s in a mosque or it\u2019s in the community. And they have to report these people,\u201d said Trump. At the press conference and at subsequent rallies in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Trump specifically alleged\u2014contrary to fact checks that have found no evidence for his claims\u2014that prior to December\u2019s terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, neighbors of the plotters saw bombs lying all over the floor of their apartment but didn\u2019t report them. In his Iowa speech, Trump issued a warning to Muslims: \u201cIf a community isn\u2019t going to report when they know something\u2019s going to happen, those people have to suffer the consequences.\u201d 4. Likening his business career to losing a child in war. In the ABC interview, Trump was asked about Khizr Khan\u2019s charge that Trump had \u201csacrificed nothing and no one\u201d for his country. Trump shot back: \u201cWho wrote that? Did Hillary\u2019s scriptwriter write it?\u201d (Actually, Khan wrote it himself.) Then Trump\u2014who had used five draft deferments to avoid service in Vietnam\u2014boasted, \u201cI have made a lot of sacrifices. I\u2019ve worked very, very hard. I\u2019ve created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures. I\u2019ve had tremendous success.\u201d While depicting his accumulation of wealth as heroic, Trump mocks people who take physical risks. His foot-dragging in acknowledging the sacrifice of Humayun Khan is just one example. Last year, Trump dismissed Sen. John McCain\u2019s ordeal as a POW in Vietnam. \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero,\u201d Trump scoffed. \u201cHe\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren\u2019t captured, OK?\u201d More recently, Trump has ridiculed another Vietnam veteran, Secretary of State John Kerry, for breaking his leg in a bicycle accident. At two rallies last week, Trump raised his hand and offered a sarcastic pledge: \u201c I give you my word, I will never enter a bicycle competition as long as I\u2019m president.\u201d 5. Using war to steal wealth. In his convention speech, Khizr Khan said his son \u201csacrificed his life to save the lives of his fellow soldiers.\u201d He advised to Trump to visit Arlington National Cemetery and \u201clook at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America.\u201d Trump, however, sees war as a business proposition. At his rally in Roanoke, and later during a speech in Toledo, Ohio, Trump said the United States should have seized Iraq\u2019s oil. \u201c Take the oil! Take the oil!\u201c Trump shouted at the crowd in Toledo. \u201cTo the victor belong the spoils!\u201d 6. Rejecting military ethics. Khizr Khan brandished a copy of the Constitution and spoke of American values. Trump accepts no such restraints. Throughout his campaign, Trump has defended torture and the deliberate targeting of family members of terrorists. Since the convention, he has escalated his rhetoric. At several rallies, Trump derided his vanquished primary opponents for agonizing over whether to permit waterboarding. Trump told crowds that he, unlike his opponents, had no qualms. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even think about it. Absolutely,\u201d he bragged in Cedar Rapids. Trump\u2019s view is that the United States should behave no better than ISIS because scruples are a disadvantage. In Cedar Rapids, he complained that ISIS drowns and decapitates people, while \u201cwe\u2019re playing by different rules.\u201d In Harrisburg, he objected again to following a \u201cdifferent set of rules. They can chop off heads, they can drown people, they can bury you in sand. And we can\u2019t waterboard. \u2026 It\u2019s very hard when you\u2019re not playing on a level playing field, folks.\u201d 7. Glorifying success at other people\u2019s expense. Trump often boasts that he sucked profit out of properties in Atlantic City, New Jersey, leaving investors, contractors, and taxpayers holding the tab. Now he\u2019s bragging about a Cincinnati apartment complex that sank into hard times after he sold it. \u201cI had great success,\u201d he told a crowd in Columbus, Ohio, on Monday:  We bought it from HUD and turned it around. \u2026 And then we sold it at a tremendous profit, and we went on to the next. \u2026 After I sold it, the job went very bad. The job went very bad. I mean, it went\u2014My timing was very good. \u2026 The timing was beautiful. \u2026 It lost a lot of its occupants. That\u2019s how the timing was. It was, like, perfect timing.  Congratulations, Donald. Ohioans suffered, but you pocketed the cash. 8. Challenging the legitimacy of American elections. In Columbus, Trump told his followers, \u201cI\u2019m afraid the election is going to be rigged.\u201d The next day, at a rally in Ashburn, Virginia, he claimed that a \u201c crooked system\u201c\u2014apparently, the FBI\u2014had allowed Hillary Clinton to \u201cget away with\u201d abuse of a private email server. In interviews with Hannity and the Washington Post, Trump also criticized recent court rulings against voter ID requirements, predicted fraud, and specifically cited precincts that recorded \u201c practically nobody\u201c voting for Mitt Romney in 2012. Trump didn\u2019t make the connection explicit, but the context of his insinuations is racial. He raised his criticism of the courts three days after the Fourth Circuit struck down a North Carolina voter ID law for managing to \u201d target African-Americans with almost surgical precision.\u201d The precinct results to which Trump alluded were in black neighborhoods of Philadelphia, Cleveland, and other cities. He offered no evidence of fraud, and post-election analyses have found that the recorded results in these precincts are perfectly plausible. But that hasn\u2019t stopped Trump and his advisers from suggesting that a Trump defeat, by itself, would prove the election was stolen. As Trump put it to Hannity: \u201cThat election is going to be rigged. And I hope the Republicans are watching closely, or it\u2019s going to be taken away from us.\u201d 9. Injecting race into the Russia debate. At his Miami press conference, Trump said he would be better than Obama at improving relations with Russia:  Putin has said things over the last year that are really bad things, OK? He mentioned the N word one time. I was shocked to hear him mention the N word. You know what the N word is, right? He mentioned it. I was shocked. He has a total lack of respect for President Obama. No. 1, he doesn\u2019t like him, and No. 2, he doesn\u2019t respect him. I think he\u2019s going to respect your president if I\u2019m elected. And I hope he likes me.  There\u2019s no evidence Putin has ever used that word, much less that he applied it to Obama. But the notion that Putin has used it, or must have used it, has floated around right-wing circles for some time. Trump\u2019s defenders creatively plead that by \u201cN word,\u201d he might have been referring to Putin\u2019s talk of deploying nuclear weapons against ISIS. But as Slate\u2019s Jeremy Stahl has explained, that interpretation makes no sense: Trump has said the same thing, so he wouldn\u2019t call such a comment bad or shocking. After the press conference, Stahl asked the Trump campaign to clarify Trump\u2019s meaning. To this day, the campaign hasn\u2019t responded. Trump\u2019s remarks about Putin echo his previous remarks about women. In 2013, Trump wrote that integrating women into the military was \u201c dumb\u201c because it resulted in sexual assaults. His approach in both cases is the same: If somebody disrespects or abuses you because of your sex or race, Trump thinks the solution is to remove you. 10. Raising backlash as an argument against a female president. Trump has repeatedly invoked Obama\u2019s race in tweets against the president. In 2014, Trump warned: \u201cSadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won\u2019t see another black president for generations!\u201d Now Trump is using the same pitch against Clinton. At a rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on July 27, he warned women not to make Clinton the first female president: \u201cShe\u2019ll set you back a long way, women, if that happens! It\u2019ll be a long way before it happens again. You better be careful what you wish for.\u201d Trump has also attacked Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, but his angle against her is ethnic, not sexual. At least nine times since the Democratic convention, at rallies and in tweets, Trump has called Warren \u201c Pocahontas.\u201d The context is complicated: Warren\u2019s purported Native American heritage is unverified, but it also seems to have been a nonfactor in her career. Nevertheless, Trump, who has a record of mocking Native American claims, calls her \u201cPocahontas\u201d to flaunt his disdain for political correctness. Trump\u2019s behavior since his convention shows that nothing has changed. Whatever Ryan said to him has had no effect. Trump continues to use religion, race, and gender as political weapons. He spurns American values, military values, and common decency. Occasional dissents, such as Ryan\u2019s statement of support for the Khan family, won\u2019t cut it. Trump is comprehensively vile. If you stand with him, Mr. Speaker, you stand for nothing.","label":1}
{"text":"What Black People Hear When Donald Trump Asks for Their Vote: Timothy A. Clary\/Getty Images The Rev. Mark Burns arrives at Trump Tower for a meeting with Donald Trump in New York City on Nov. 30, 2015. To the extent that Donald Trump is reaching out to black Americans, his pitch relies on a bleak vision of black life in the United States and an attack on Democratic Party leadership in those same cities. \u201cInner-city crime is reaching record levels. African-Americans will vote for Trump because they know I will stop the slaughter going on,\u201d tweeted Trump on Monday. \u201cNow that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary-type policy and management has done to the inner-cities, they want TRUMP!\u201d So far, there is no groundswell of black enthusiasm for Trump. He wins 8 percent of black voters in the latest poll from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal; he wins 5 percent in the latest survey from Morning Consult; and he wins just 3.6 percent in the latest poll from Reuters\/Ipsos. In critical swing states like Pennsylvania and Ohio, he wins a statistically negligible share of the black vote, i.e. zero percent. In a sign of confidence, however, Trump plans to take his message to Detroit, where he\u2019ll hold his first event in a predominantly black community, speaking with Bishop Wayne T. Jackson of Great Faith Ministries. There\u2019s a strong chance he\u2019ll stick to his present pitch, even as it lands flat with the vast majority of black voters. That fact\u2014black indifference or even antipathy to Trump and his rhetoric\u2014deserves a little more attention. It\u2019s not that black voters are hostile to Trump; it\u2019s that they won\u2019t even entertain his basic message. There\u2019s nothing he could say or do in the realm of possibility that would budge his numbers away from historic lows, much less restore them to the double digits enjoyed by George W. Bush in the 2004 election. Given the real problems facing black voters\u2014including higher rates of joblessness and criminal victimization\u2014why aren\u2019t they receptive to Trump\u2019s message? The simple answer is that it\u2019s patronizing, ahistorical nonsense that\u2019s not at all unique to Trump. The problem goes beyond the mere optics of his \u201coutreach\u201d\u2014producing dystopian portraits of black life for predominantly white audiences. And it\u2019s not just the extent to which Trump is talking about black Americans rather than to them. The central issue is that Trump portrays black Americans not as able citizens who need to be convinced, but as mindless followers of a failed regime. \u201cThe Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community. Democratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty,\u201d Trump said in a recent speech in Milwaukee. He continued: \u201cThe Democratic Party has run nearly every inner city in this country for 50 years, and run them into financial ruin. They\u2019ve ruined the schools. They\u2019ve driven out the jobs. They\u2019ve tolerated a level of crime no American should consider acceptable.\u201d In this narrative, black Americans are mere objects\u2014means to a partisan end. They do not choose or act as political agents. There are no black politicians or activists or leaders of any stripe. Instead, they are acted upon, tools of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. And worse, despite the horrors of Democratic governance, they don\u2019t understand that they\u2019ve been used and \u201cbetrayed.\u201d They still vote for Democrats in overwhelming numbers. They are dupes. Trump\u2019s argument isn\u2019t new. It is de rigueur among conservative personalities to blame the Republican Party\u2019s poor performance with black voters on a \u201cplantation mentality,\u201d in which blacks are kept hopelessly dependent on government benefits and the Democratic Party that peddles them. The goal: to keep black Americans from grasping the truth that prosperity comes from \u201cliberty\u201d and free markets. You can hear this perspective throughout right-wing media, from Fox News and popular websites like Townhall, to films like Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s Hillary\u2019s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party and Pritchett Cotten\u2019s Runaway Slave, a documentary that claims to show how \u201cpeople can break free from a form of modern slavery caused by relying on welfare,\u201d and in which a black conservative\u2014the Rev. C.L. Bryant\u2014is the titular \u201crunaway slave\u201d who escapes the implied Democratic \u201cplantation.\u201d Key to the \u201cplantation\u201d theory is the idea that modern Democrats are direct heirs to the white supremacist Democratic Party of the 19th and early 20th centuries. For proponents, it is a straight line from John C. Calhoun to Jefferson Davis to Theodore Bilbo to Lyndon Johnson to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. You hear this in Trump\u2019s rhetoric as well. \u201cWe reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton,\u201d he has said, \u201cwhich panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes, not as individual human beings worthy of a better future.\u201d Whereas Bilbo relied on terrorism to suppress blacks, modern Democrats use the welfare state to achieve the same ends. And the apex of this arrangement is in the inner cities governed for generations by ruinous Democratic policies. These narratives and arguments are bizarre to the point of incoherence, a fourth-rate imitation of history, devoid of any actual meaning. Shaped, influenced, and even driven by black Americans in the middle of the 20th century, the modern Democratic Party is not the literal descendant of the white supremacist party that bore the name for a century; in much of the modern-day South, black Americans are the Democratic Party. Black Americans have had an active role in Democratic Party politics for two generations, culminating in the election of Barack Obama, a black American. More broadly, blacks have not been led astray\u2014they are not victims of false consciousness or some \u201cplantation mentality.\u201d They are political actors making choices based on their interests as they see them. Likewise, the issues in urban America aren\u2019t the product of the Democratic Party or the black mayors and city councilors who took the reins of the cities in the 1970s and 1980s. The decline of Detroit or Cleveland or Baltimore didn\u2019t begin in 1967. Instead, they\u2019re the cumulative result of a century of policies, from redlining and housing discrimination to white flight, federal neglect, and ongoing hostility from surrounding municipalities. There\u2019s no question that these cities have been marred by bad governance, but to understand that in terms of party affiliation\u2014neglecting the effects of deindustrialization, racism, and capital flight\u2014is to show profound ignorance of urban politics and problems. Blacks are not victims of false consciousness or some \u201cplantation mentality.\u201d They are political actors making choices based on their interests as they see them. Beyond incoherent, the ideas underlying Trump\u2019s narrative are racist, full stop. If \u201cplantation\u201d theory is true, then black voters are the mindless drones of American politics. Nefarious Democrats gave them a taste of government, and they never abandoned the hand that fed them. White voters, by contrast, are active citizens\u2014noble republicans in the best tradition of the founders. It\u2019s ironic: For as much as they disdain Democrats as the real racists, it\u2019s the proponents of plantation theory who echo the arguments and propaganda of the pro-Southern, anti-emancipation Democrats of the Civil War era. \u201cThe Freedman's Bureau!\u201d sang one poster from the 1866 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, advocating on behalf of Hiester Clymer and his white-supremacist platform. \u201cAn agency to keep the Negro in idleness at the expense of the white man.\u201d What\u2019s key is that black voters hear this sentiment in the rhetoric used by Trump and other conservatives. It\u2019s one reason that, despite having been peddled in its current incarnation by black conservatives and their allies for the better part of a decade, the argument has never gotten any traction. The other reason is Barack Obama. Tens of millions of black Americans hold the president and his family in high esteem as exemplars of the black community. For them, he deserves respect regardless of your politics. And if there\u2019s anything that defines the GOP in the present age for black voters, it\u2019s the outsized disrespect for Obama, from South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson\u2019s \u201c you lie\u201d to the birther crusade pursued so vigorously by Trump and others. Black Americans see this, and they remember. Somewhere in the multiverse is a world where black voters have warmed to Donald Trump. It\u2019s not this one. In this world, for blacks to reconsider Trump and the Republican Party, they would have to ignore his birtherism; they would have to ignore the push for voter ID and the attacks on civil rights legislation; they would have to downplay the patronizing \u201coutreach\u201d of conservative voices and Republican politicians. For blacks to reconsider Trump, they would have to act as if they were the dupes of his imagination.","label":1}
{"text":"Trump\u2019s Campaign Against Clinton Is an Exercise in Projection: Gary Gershoff\/Getty Images for Cantor Fitzgerald Presidential candidate and gifted projector Donald Trump in New York City on Monday. \u201cShe is trigger-happy and very unstable, whether we like it or not, that\u2019s what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Donald Trump of Hillary Clinton during a speech on foreign policy last week. She\u2019s \u201calso reckless, so reckless, in fact, that she put her emails on an illegal server that our enemies could easily hack and probably have.\u201d \u201cTrigger-happy.\u201d \u201cUnstable.\u201d \u201cReckless.\u201d All of this coming from a candidate who recently said this about tensions with Iran: \u201cWith Iran, when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water.\u201d Trump isn\u2019t making an argument about his opponent; he\u2019s projecting, and in the race against Clinton, it is a defining aspect of Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric. Rather than challenge the Democratic presidential nominee on substance, Trump takes an approach familiar to anyone who has spent time on an elementary school playground. I know you are, but what am I? Take this response to the hosts of Fox and Friends, from an August discussion of Clinton\u2019s email practices: \u201cWell, look, she\u2019s a liar. I mean, she lies. She lied about the email. She lied about Colin Powell. I saw that. He was not happy and it\u2019s\u2014the whole thing is a scam with them. Everything is a scam, like grifters.\u201d As with most Trump rhetoric, this is worth a fact-check. Few politicians are completely honest, but compared with her peers, Clinton is less likely to make false statements, as judged by Politifact. And to that point, the FBI investigation of Clinton\u2019s private server\u2014as well as documentary evidence such as the correspondence between Clinton and Powell\u2014supports the Democratic nominee\u2019s version of events. Trump, put simply, is wrong. But that\u2019s not the projection. The projection is the claim that, with Bill and Hillary Clinton, \u201cEverything is a scam, like grifters.\u201d At present, at least three of Trump\u2019s endeavors are under investigation or serious scrutiny\u2014Trump University, Trump Institute, and the Trump Foundation. All of them have the makings of scams, from dishonest business practices to the use of ostensibly charitable dollars for personal expenses. And this doesn\u2019t include Trump\u2019s real estate career, rife with stories of exploitation, wage theft, and borderline fraud. Trump takes an approach familiar to anyone who has spent time on a playground. I know you are, but what am I? Trump has projected more than just behavior onto his opponent; he\u2019s projected his entire approach to politics. After Clinton detailed Trump\u2019s ties to white nationalists and other hate groups, Trump gave a response, essentially turning her claim on its head. \u201cShe is a bigot because you look at what\u2019s happening to the inner cities, you look at what\u2019s happening to African Americans and Hispanics in this country where she talks all the time,\u201d Trump said to CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. Asked if he thinks Clinton is \u201cpersonally\u201d prejudiced, Trump replied: \u201cWell, she is, of course she is. Her policies\u2014they\u2019re her policies, she comes out with the policies and others that believe like she does also. \u2026 This is over the years, a long time. She\u2019s totally bigoted, there\u2019s no question about that.\u201d Keep in mind that this comes from a candidate who began his campaigns suggesting that some number of Mexican immigrants were \u201crapists,\u201d whose signature policies are a wall on the Mexican border and a ban on Muslim immigration, and whose \u201c outreach\u201d to black voters involves grossly exaggerated depictions of black life that rely on racist tropes about black criminality. One especially egregious instance of this projection came on Monday, during a rally in Asheville, North Carolina. Responding to Clinton\u2019s claim that \u201chalf of Trump supporters\u201d are in a \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d the Republican presidential nominee said this:  Our vision of hope stands in stark contrast to my opponent\u2019s campaign of hate. Hillary Clinton has been running a hate-filled and negative campaign, with no policy, no solutions and no new ideas.   By contrast, I\u2019ve been going around the country offering very detailed plans for reform and change. All of these reform plans are available on our website, and they\u2019re extensive, but we have no choice.  This is almost unbelievable. In his acceptance address to the Republican National Convention and in his recent speech to supporters in Phoenix, Trump painted a dark, dystopian picture of an America rendered prostrate by crime, violence, and disorder. In Trump\u2019s America, \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d roam streets, killing innocents and destroying families. His is a country where all leaders are corrupt, all institutions are rigged, and he is the only savior. \u201cHate-filled and negative\u201d is a straightforward description of Trump\u2019s campaign, and it was especially apt in Asheville, where a Trump supporter attacked a protester. Likewise, the Trump campaign is notable for its indifference to public policy. Trump has little grasp of basic details and is unable to articulate\u2014in any detail\u2014his plans for anything on his agenda. Clinton, by contrast, has released a 300-page book dedicated to her policy agenda. Overall, according to the Associated Press, Trump\u2019s campaign has released around 9,000 words in policy papers, compared with more than 112,000 from Clinton\u2019s campaign. This projection is such a regular part of Trump\u2019s message that it begins to feel like strategy, as if Trump and his team aren\u2019t running a campaign for the presidency so much as gaslighting the country. And there\u2019s no sign he plans to stop. On Tuesday, at a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, he fed the audience red meat with a full-throated attack on the Democratic nominee. \u201cHillary Clinton is running a policy-free campaign. She offers no ideas, no solutions, and only hatred and derision.\u201d He can\u2019t be serious.","label":1}
{"text":"Banana Republican: Chip Somodevilla\/Getty Images Donald Trump at the second presidential debate Sunday. ST. LOUIS\u2014The most important part of Sunday night\u2019s presidential debate happened within the first 20 minutes. The rest wasn\u2019t uninteresting\u2014at one point, Donald Trump confessed to not paying income taxes, at another broke with his running mate on what to do in Syria\u2014but it wasn\u2019t vital. It wasn\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t be, the chief takeaway. The honor goes to the first major moment of the debate. That\u2019s where, after a lengthy exchange, a menacing and almost unhinged Trump threatened to put Clinton in prison should he win the White House in November. Even in a campaign in which Republican crowds chant \u201clock her up\u201d and Trump surrogates play-act anti-Clinton tribunals, it was extraordinary and disturbing. The behavior of a despot, not of a president. The ramp-up to this was revelatory. Trump was cornered, and he responded with a burst of banana-republic machismo, vowing to investigate and prosecute a political opponent using the powers of his office. It was a remarkable moment: a presidential nominee promising to rip up the foundations of liberal democracy for the sake of getting off a good attack line. It began with the first question. One of the two moderators, CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, asked Trump to account for the now-infamous tape in which the Republican nominee claims to \u201cgrab\u201d women \u201cby the pussy,\u201d bragging about sexual assault. Trump called it \u201clocker room talk\u201d and tried to pivot to ISIS. Cooper stopped him and pressed him on the question, which he tried to avoid. Trump returned to his campaign slogan\u2014\u201cWe\u2019re going to make America great again\u201d\u2014and Cooper turned the question over to Clinton, who hit one of her themes. \u201cDonald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander in chief,\u201d said Clinton, before rattling off the laundry list of groups that Trump has attacked and insulted over the course of the campaign. He responded\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s just words, folks. Just words.\u201d\u2014and the moderators brought the debate back to audience questions, including one submitted online. This one also focused on the tape. \u201cWhen you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man, or did that behavior continue until just recently?\u201d Again, Trump called this \u201clocker room talk.\u201d But then he went in a different direction, one presaged by both his Friday night apology video and an unusual pre-debate \u201cpress conference\u201d involving three women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault. \u201cThere\u2019s never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that\u2019s been so abusive to women,\u201d said Trump of the former president. \u201cYou can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.\u201d He continued, tying Hillary to her husband\u2019s history with women. \u201cHillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.\u201d Clinton had a chance to respond, and she did, again reciting Trump\u2019s attacks on a variety of groups and individuals, from the Khan family\u2014whose son died fighting in Iraq\u2014and Judge Gonzalo Curiel, to President Obama, whom Trump repeatedly attacked as illegitimate on the basis of his birth. It\u2019s at this juncture that the Republican nominee\u2014already teetering on the edge of decorum\u2014went off the rails. He accused Clinton of starting the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy; he questioned her friendship with Michelle Obama; he accused Clinton of rigging the Democratic primary to rob Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders of the election; and he slammed her for her emails, all leading to an explosion of contempt and menace. \u201cIf I win,\u201d said Trump, \u201cI\u2019m going to instruct the attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there\u2019s never been so many lies, so much deception.\u201d He continued: \u201c[W]e\u2019re going to get a special prosecutor because people have been, their lives have been destroyed for doing one fifth of what you\u2019ve done.\u201d And when Clinton gave her response\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law of our country\u201d\u2014Trump jumped in with a quip. \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail.\u201d There\u2019s no charitable read here, or at least not one that respects the rules and structure of the English language. Trump\u2019s meaning is plain. Should he win the Oval Office, he will use his authority vis-\u00e0-vis the Justice Department to launch an investigation of his rival in the presidential election. And because he believes Clinton uniquely perfidious, this investigation would lead to her prosecution, conviction, and imprisonment. As he said, she would be in jail. Historians, commentators, and \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republicans quickly grasped the weight of his statement. \u201cOnly time I\u2019ve ever heard a candidate threatening to jail his opponent was in the Congo. He lost  ; was later convicted of war crimes,\u201d tweeted former Mitt Romney campaign manager Stuart Stevens. On television, CBS\u2019s Bob Schieffer said Trump\u2019s threat reminded him of a \u201cbanana republic.\u201d And University of Virginia historian Nicole Hemmer stressed that this was a \u201cbreathtaking violation of our democratic tradition.\u201d She\u2019s right. The United States is not a perfect democracy. But one thing we can say is that, in America, political opponents are just that: political opponents. They aren\u2019t hounded and they aren\u2019t imprisoned. It isn\u2019t a crime to be on the other side of an election. To go down that road is to take a shortcut to despotism and repression. On Sunday, to an audience of tens of millions of Americans, Trump voiced his contempt for the norms that define and safeguard our democracy with a promise to jail his chief political opponent. This, again, was the most important moment of the debate. Nothing else\u2014not Clinton\u2019s poor answers for her private speeches, nor Trump\u2019s abject ignorance\u2014comes close. And it\u2019s all the more important given Trump\u2019s larger platform. If elected, the Republican would use the force of the state against nonwhites and religious minorities, from forced deportations of unauthorized Hispanic immigrants to surveillance of Muslim Americans and a return to stop-and-frisk. Trump already promises an authoritarian state for millions of Americans. This statement\u2014planned and strategically deployed\u2014just shows the scope of his vision. In all of this, it\u2019s worth noting the complicity of the GOP leadership. An hour after Trump promised to jail his opponent if elected president, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus praised his nominee\u2019s performance. \u201cHillary Clinton spent the night struggling to defender her failed record,\u201d he said on Twitter. American democracy needs two healthy parties, at least, to survive and to thrive. Sunday showed we have just one.","label":1}
{"text":"A Preview of a Despot: Saul Loeb\/AFP\/Getty Images Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton during Sunday's town hall in St. Louis. In a normal presidential election, debates are a chance to compare two plausible candidates. This isn\u2019t a normal election. If you chatter about who won or lost on points, you\u2019re missing the story. The story in these debates is that the public is getting a chance to see, before it happens, what it would be like to have Donald Trump as president. It would be one of the most dangerous crises in the history of the United States. The first debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton, held on Sept. 26, exposed Trump\u2019s views on financial and civic responsibility. He advocated tax avoidance, international theft, stiffing vendors and creditors, exploiting the misfortunes of others, and deploying the military as a global protection racket. Viewers got a chance to see that Trump was no ordinary crook. He completely lacks a conscience. The second debate, held on Sunday, exposed Trump\u2019s views on human rights, civil rights, and the rule of law. Essentially, he doesn\u2019t believe in them. The debate opened with a question about role-modeling. CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper asked Trump about the recently disclosed 2005 video in which Trump bragged about using his star power to grope women. \u201cYou described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals,\u201d said Cooper. \u201cThat is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?\u201d Trump dismissed his taped comments as \u201clocker-room talk.\u201d Then, without missing a beat, he continued:  We have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads. \u2026 And they look at our country and they see what\u2019s going on. Yes, I\u2019m very embarrassed by it [the video]. I hate it. But it\u2019s locker-room talk, and it\u2019s one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. \u2026 We\u2019re going to have borders in our country, which we don\u2019t have now. People are pouring into our country, and they\u2019re coming in from the Middle East and other places.  Why did Trump answer a question about sexual assault by pledging to block refugees and knock the hell out of ISIS? Because to him, it\u2019s all about power. He\u2019s proud of the macho image in the tape, even if he regrets that his language was graphic enough to hurt him politically. The guy who talks big in the locker room is the guy we can count on to break some heads. Half an hour later, a Muslim woman asked the candidates, \u201cHow will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country?\u201d Trump answered her by repeating his slander that \u201cin San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment\u201d of the terrorists before they struck last December. This claim has been debunked so many times that there\u2019s no longer an innocent explanation for Trump\u2019s continued use of it. \u201cMuslims have to report the problems when they see them,\u201d said Trump. He didn\u2019t mention, but also didn\u2019t renounce, his threat to punish all Muslims for attacks like the one in San Bernardino. (\u201cIf a community isn\u2019t going to report when they know something\u2019s going to happen, those people have to suffer the consequences,\u201d Trump told a crowd in Ohio on Aug. 1.) Nor did Trump renounce his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Twice, ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz asked Trump whether \u201cthe Muslim ban still stands\u201d or \u201cis no longer your position.\u201d Trump refused to say yes or no. Instead, he said his plan had \u201cmorphed into extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.\u201d Raddatz also asked Trump whether it was \u201ca mistake to have a religious test.\u201d Trump didn\u2019t answer. Trump called for more military collaboration with Russia (whose invasion of Ukraine he has previously defended) and opposed aid to rebels who are fighting Russian forces in Syria. He asserted, contrary to the assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies, that Clinton \u201cdoesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s the Russians doing the hacking\u201d of American email accounts and Web sites to influence our election. In fact, Trump ventured, \u201cMaybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia.\u201d Raddatz noted that Trump\u2019s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, \u201csaid provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.\u201d Pence\u2019s statement was conservative orthodoxy, but Trump rejected it. \u201cI disagree,\u201d said Trump. Presented with a choice between Russian and anti-Russian foreign policy, Trump chose Russia. Vladimir Putin is Trump\u2019s spiritual running mate. Trump doesn\u2019t just admire Putin. He emulates him. Like Putin, Trump threatens journalists. Like Putin, he preaches \u201claw and order\u201d while encouraging mob violence. Like Putin, Trump says he can order the military to deliberately kill civilians. And like Putin, he refuses to tell voters what kind of wars he would wage as president. In Sunday\u2019s debate, Trump rebuffed questions about what he would do in Syria, arguing that to disclose his plans would tip off the enemy. While praising Putin, Trump ridiculed the U.S. government for its transparency. \u201cHow stupid is our country?\u201d he asked. One of Putin\u2019s goals in hacking U.S. government websites is to discredit our electoral process. He would like to destabilize American democracy. Trump has aided this project by warning that the election is \u201c rigged.\u201d In the debate, Trump piled on, claiming that Clinton had cheated Bernie Sanders out of the Democratic nomination. But that was nothing. A few minutes later, Trump went full Putin. He threatened not just to defeat Clinton, but to imprison her. \u201cIf I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,\u201d Trump told Clinton. Twice more, he repeated the threat: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a special prosecutor.\u201d Clinton, marveling at this outburst, expressed relief \u201cthat someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.\u201d To which Trump retorted: \u201cBecause you\u2019d be in jail.\u201d These are norms we don\u2019t openly trash in the United States in the 21st century. We don\u2019t settle political disputes by jailing opponents. We don\u2019t dismiss election results and promote political violence. We don\u2019t serve and emulate dictators. We don\u2019t suspend the civil liberties of minorities. We don\u2019t worship men who abuse women and brag about it. Occasionally, we\u2019ve crossed some of these lines. But no major-party presidential nominee has so baldly renounced them. For 240 years, Americans worked, fought, and died to get us this far. We could blow it all in a day. That\u2019s what I saw in this debate. I hope enough of our countrymen did, too.","label":1}
{"text":"Trump\u2019s Fearmongering, Hate-Filled Speech on Orlando Is the Scariest Thing He\u2019s Done Yet: Every time a mass shooting occurs in the United States, commentators note how scary it is that we\u2019ve almost become numb to them. But the past year has proven that we also risk becoming numb to another grave threat to America and the world: Donald Trump. His behavior in the past 36 hours has been so horrifically grotesque in so many different ways that it is easy to become emotionally immune to his hideous and bigoted comments, and the soullessness of his response to tragedy. But we shouldn\u2019t become immune: Trump\u2019s response to the Orlando attack is a frightening window into how he might govern if elected. And his speech on Monday afternoon was the most terrifying of the campaign. The fact that it was more of the same\u2014demagoguery, fearmongering, outright lies\u2014shouldn\u2019t blind us to its disgusting content. Seemingly of the belief that simply saying \u201cradical Islam\u201d will win the war on terror (in this, at least, he doesn\u2019t depart from the party he now leads), Trump mouthed the phrase many times Monday afternoon. But he also mouthed many other phrases, each one more disturbing than the next. He accused the president of consciously keeping law enforcement from doing its job; he scolded Hillary Clinton for saying Muslims were peaceful; he claimed he was right to call for a Muslim ban; he talked of huddling with the NRA to help prevent attacks. He talked of \u201cthese people\u201d; he implied that almost all Afghans were extremists; he lied about the place of birth of the alleged shooter, who was American-born. \u201cCan you imagine what they will do in large groups?\u201d Trump asked, saying Obama had tried to bring \u201clarge groups\u201d of Muslims from abroad. He claimed that immigrants would constitute a Trojan horse, implying that Muslims coming here were part of some secret plan. He\u2019s been saying this nonsense since Sunday morning. On Fox News, he hinted that Obama is either a sympathizer of Islamic terrorism, or some kind of sleeper cell. (Trump\u2019s adviser, Roger Stone, wondered whether Clinton aide Huma Abedin was a \"terrorist plant.\") He\u2019s been smearing refugees as dangerous terrorists, because in his mind, our country is overwhelmed with Syrians (we haven\u2019t been taking very many in), our children are at risk of indoctrination by Muslims, and anyone who calls for any sort of understanding is a politically correct fool. Decency is weakness; authoritarianism is safety. The lowest moment of the lowest speech in this very low campaign came near the end, when Trump, noting that Muslims must talk to authorities about their neighbors, said, \u201cThe Muslim community, so importantly, they have to work with us. They have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad. And they know it. And they have to do it forthwith.\u201d It was all there: the \u201cus\u201d that doesn\u2019t include Muslim-Americans, the not-so-vague menace behind the warning, the claim about what \u201cthey\u201d know. In the prepared version of the speech, Trump specifically mentioned prison time for people who refused to cooperate. But in the actual speech, he said this instead: \"These people have to have consequences. Big consequences.\" This last-minute edit is the essence of Trumpism. Demagogues often leave things to the imaginations of both followers and victims. Therein lies both part of their appeal and their power to frighten. It\u2019s been clear for a long time that Donald Trump must not become president. But Monday\u2019s speech was another reminder that the prospect of his victory should scare us, motivate us, and keep in our minds that stopping him is both a practical and moral necessity.","label":1}
{"text":"Is America As Good As Hillary Clinton Says It Is?: PHILADELPHIA\u2014On June 15, Politico ran a story about Hillary Clinton\u2019s bureaucratic speechwriting process. It describes how she gets input from a handful of staffers, various consultants, and her husband. She tweaks it herself, usually to make it more prosaic. \u201cClinton is known for taking a draft of a speech and changing it some indelible way to make it more literal and less readable,\u201d the piece said. Created in this fashion, the speeches are comprehensive but lack poetry, a sustained argument, or a narrative arc. Anyone who expected her to transcend this clunky method was probably disappointed on Thursday night. Her speech was workmanlike, more a series of bullet points than a story. She seemed loosest when she was making fun of Donald Trump: \u201cA man you can bait with a tweet is not a man you can trust with nuclear weapons.\u201d On Twitter, people complained about her voice. Wrote Steve Clemons, an editor at the Atlantic:  Instead of lecturing 2 citizens @HillaryClinton needs 2 have conversation w\/us. Modulate voice. Tell stories. Set hopes. Smile #DNCinPHL\u2014 Steve Clemons (@SCClemons) July 29, 2016  Tweeted Bloomberg View's Megan McArdle:  It may be sexist that Clinton\u2019s voice sounds hectoring when it gets loud. It\u2019s also a fact.  ; that fact will matter https:\/\/t.co\/dwanmRqFVM\u2014 (((Megan McArdle))) (@asymmetricinfo) July 29, 2016  Both were quickly attacked, but my guess is that a lot of people felt the same way. If you\u2019re a feminist, it\u2019s deeply moving to see a woman in a white suit\u2014one of the iconic colors of the suffragettes\u2014hug her daughter and then accept her party\u2019s nomination for president of the United States. Nevertheless, Clinton is never going to be a great orator. She\u2019s certainly not an entertainer. She clearly prefers listening to others to talking about herself. As she said, \u201cThe truth is through all these years of public service, the service part has always come easier than the public part.\u201d The question now is whether this matters. Clinton presides over the party of sanity and decency and whose convention showcased the best of America. It honored mothers who\u2019ve lost sons to police violence, even as it left Republicans envying its optimism and patriotism. Its candidate is running against a cruel and unstable madman. If America is as great as convention speakers claimed, her citizens will not decide to blow it up because they don\u2019t think Clinton is likable enough. This was precisely the challenge Clinton and the Democrats laid out this week for the country: Are you as great as we say you are?","label":1}
{"text":"Clinton on Trump\u2019s Birtherism: \u201cA Racist Lie\u201d: Debate moderator Lester Holt, bless his heart, decided to ask Donald Trump about birtherism, i.e., Trump's chief contribution to American political discourse from the day he was born through early 2015. It did not go especially well. Trump responded to the question with the laughable explanation his campaign decided to go with in the end: that it was Hillary Clinton who started the rumor, that they both spent years ardently searching for President Obama's birth certificate, and only he could successfully pressure its release. This is a lie because a) Hillary Clinton did not start birtherism, and b) there was no mainstream interest in getting Obama to produce the long-form birth certificate, because it was a ridiculous fringe theory. Clinton responded to this \"racist lie\":  He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted. He persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it. But remember, Donald started his career back in 1973, being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination. Because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department. So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. And you know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him, but I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: \"When they go low, we go high.\" And Barack Obama went high. Despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.  Clinton did not, for whatever reason, directly address the spin that it was she and her top-level 2008 staffers who were the genesis of this idea.","label":1}
{"text":"The Bizarre Political Logic That Leads Conservative Pundits to Downplay a Hurricane: Bill Pugliano\/Getty Images Rush Limbaugh is among the prominent conservatives who have decided hurricane models are a liberal conspiracy. One of the stranger and more troubling political developments of the past 15 years has been the conservative response to scientists' warnings of potentially catastrophic climate change. If climate change is real, to address it would probably require government intervention in industry. And conservatives are opposed to that. Therefore, climate change must not be real! The scientists are all lying. And if the scientists are the sort of people who would lie to us about the climate, what else might they be lying about? Hurricanes, for one thing. So goes the logic, if I may use the term loosely, of the influential conservative blogger Matt Drudge. On Thursday, as Hurricane Matthew approached the Florida coast with 130mph winds\u2014so the scientists claim, at any rate!\u2014Drudge spied an opportunity to plant his flag and catch out those nefarious forecasters and their politically motivated hurricane models. Here is what he decided would be a good idea to tweet: Lest anyone get the mistaken impression that this was pure, shameless, and dangerously uninformed speculation on Drudge's part, he followed this up by lodging some more specific allegations of meteorological misconduct. The National Weather Service, it turns out, is a secretive cabal whose members hoard the real weather data so that they can cook up fake forecasts to hoodwink the public into evacuating their homes for no reason. Why would they do all that? What climate agenda would be served by government scientists triggering a mass evacuation for a storm that turns out to be illusory? Drudge does not deign to clarify. We're left to imagine a liberal conspiracy so farsighted that it encompasses entire fields of science and multiple arms of government, yet so nearsighted that it doesn't realize it would lose rather than gain credibility by making false predictions that will be proven wrong the moment the storm passes harmlessly by. Lest you think these are the delusional ramblings of a lone wingnut, my colleague Ben Mathis-Lilley points out that Rush Limbaugh has espoused almost exactly the same theory. From Wonkette\u2019s post on the relevant segment of today\u2019s Rush Limbaugh Show:  The National Hurricane Center is part of the National Weather Service, which is part of the Commerce Department, which is part of the Obama administration, which by definition has been tainted just like the DOJ has. ... With hurricane tracking and hurricane forecasting, I\u2019ve been able to spot where I think they might be playing games because it\u2019s in the interests of the left to have destructive hurricanes because then they can blame it on climate change, which they can continue desperately continue trying to sell.  Interestingly, Limbaugh winds up by acknowledging that Hurricane Matthew is a \u201cserious bad storm,\u201d perhaps to insulate himself from the angry recriminations if the damage is severe. Drudge seems to have missed that memo. Is it possible that it's actually Drudge and Limbaugh, and not the National Weather Service, who are misleading the public about natural disasters in order to score some cheap political points? Ah, but to believe that would require trusting professional scientists over conservative pundits to tell us the truth about science. And that in turn would suggest that perhaps we should do the same when it comes to climate science\u2014which would then raise the specter once again of having to actually do something about it, perhaps via government intervention in industry. Best not to go down that road.","label":1}
{"text":"When Powerful Men Play the Victim: LONDON \u2014 During the second presidential debate, Donald Trump once again complained that he was a victim. At one point he even moaned that it was three against one, implying that the two moderators and Hillary Clinton had ganged up on him and weren\u2019t letting him speak. In reality, at 40:10 against 39:05, Trump spoke for a minute longer than Clinton overall. But that is unlikely to satisfy his complaint, nor change the perception among his supporters that he is the \u201cunderdog,\u201d while Clinton and her campaign team are the \u201cbullies.\u201d And despite being among the richest men in America, born to wealth in the most powerful country in the world, Trump\u2019s message of victimhood is resonating. You may be forgiven for pondering aloud here\u2026 WTF? And\u2026 does he believe this stuff himself? I think he does. Power is one of life\u2019s most addictive drugs, and we need to consider the withdrawal symptoms of this intoxicant among Trump supporters. When the powerful are being leveled, they become scared. Petrified of losing the deference they believe they are entitled to, they cast themselves anew as the oppressed. Used to receiving preferential treatment, they suddenly feel discriminated against. And so it has come to pass that every time a powerful group is equalized during times of great social upheaval, they cast themselves as victims. They feel threatened, then discriminated against, and they may grow dangerous. The years after the Great War witnessed Germans and Italians bemoaning their loss of status, which led to World War II. Many in the American South felt victimized and probably scared, when Lincoln ended slavery. Some responded with the Ku Klux Klan, then Jim Crow. Misogynist men felt threatened and vulnerable when women demanded universal suffrage. And Islamism emerged after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, as Arabs and Muslims were hit by a post-colonial identity crisis, no longer being able to chart the course of the world as they knew it. How is it that Trump, one of the most powerful men in America, can see himself as the victim? Easily. Here is a man so used to acting with impunity that even after the Central Park Five were proven to be innocent he wrote a column attacking them, and refused to apologize for calling for their death. Here is somebody so used to not being held to account that he felt free to boast about sexual assaults with people he had just met. Here is a relic of power so accustomed to getting what he wants that he doesn\u2019t even let facts stand in his way (Note: Facts are only for Mexicans). And therefore, when he\u2019s finally expected to account for his actions, to justify his assertions and defend his positions, he complains about being victimized. Trump is the archetypal cry-bully, so adjusted to everything revolving around him that only he can be the victim. Nobody else\u2019s pain matters, unless of course it can be used to teach them how much he has been suffering, too. Originating in the 16th century, the word \u201cbully\u201d was a term of endearment meaning lover, or boel in Dutch, and brother, or broeder. Bully then evolved into a greeting for a jolly male friend. By the mid-17th century, an alternative meaning, \u201charasser of the weak,\u201d had started to emerge. The connection between the positive origins of \u201cbully\u201d and its now almost universal negative implication of \u201cpreying on the weak\u201d is not hard to see. That boisterous \u201cmale friend\u201d probably just engaged in, well, too much \u201cjolly\u201d locker-room talk. Like the etymology of this word, bullies have gone full circle from being the strong picking on the weak to becoming the strong complaining about being bullied; in other words, held to account. An understandable desire to ditch our overbearing culture of political correctness is no excuse. As The Donald demonstrates all too often, it is possible to be politically incorrect but still have your facts completely wrong.","label":1}

{"text":"If Donald Trump Sued the New York Times or His Accusers, It Would Be a Suicide Mission: Shutterstock Donald Trump has threatened to sue the New York Times once again, this time for publishing interviews with two women who say the billionaire groped and kissed them without consent. If that sounds familiar, it should \u2014 Bill Cosby pursued the same strategy. And look how well that turned out. Trump\u2019s case would be similarly disastrous, and his lawyers surely know it. The threats of litigation are pure hot air. First, Trump has no case against the Times \u2013 or against the Palm Beach Post, which he has also threatened. The absurd letter his lawyers sent the Times states that the \u201carticle is reckless, defamatory, and constitutes libel per se.\u201d (Libel is, roughly, the written form of defamation; slander is the spoken form.) The legal term for that claim is \u201cbullshit.\u201d As a public figure, Trump would have to prove that the newspapers acted with \u201cactual malice,\u201d i.e., the deliberate intention of harming Trump\u2019s reputation. While Trump makes this accusation all the time in the press, making it in court is a different story. Absent some kind of bizarre smoking gun \u2013 an email from a Times editor, for example, saying \u201cwe gotta get Trump\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s impossible that a court would believe that the newspaper is pursuing a vendetta against Trump, as opposed to reporting on a hot story about a presidential candidate. Even if the accusers\u2019 stories turn out to be false, the Times wouldn\u2019t be guilty of defamation. Like all careful news outlets, the Timesis careful to attribute the accusations to the women themselves: \u201cMs. Leeds said\u201d \u201cshe recalled\u201d \u201cMs. Crooks recalled.\u201d This is standard journalistic practice, and of course the Times followed it to a T. The Times, itself, hasn\u2019t said that the accusations are true. It has merely reported that the accusations are being made. The only shred of a legal claim in the Trump lawyers\u2019 letter is that the Times did not adequately \u201ctest the veracity of these false and malicious allegations, including why these two individuals waited\u201d to make them \u2013 11 years and 30 years, respectively. That\u2019s a claim so false as to be delusional. The third paragraph of the Times piece clearly explains that Jessica Leeds, one of the accusers, was provoked by Trump\u2019s claim, in the second presidential debate, that he had never actually groped anyone. Nor is the Times likely to be intimidated by the prospect of a Trump lawsuit. They have their own lawyers, who surely reviewed the piece before it went out, and they know the law. Some have speculated that smaller news outlets may indeed be intimidated by such threats, but this type of exposure isn\u2019t like the Hulk Hogan tape that sunk Gawker. Any properly-vetted, reasonably sourced accusations are safe; they are about a public figure and germane to a central issue in the presidential campaign. Indeed, though Trump has alleged politics is behind the Times piece, surely his lawyers\u2019 threatening letter is, itself, political theater. And now the Times responded in kind, making the politically incendiary claim that since Trump has already bragged about abusing women, his reputation can't be harmed by the story. This is not a good legal defense, which the Times lawyers know; it is basically saying \"we dare you to sue us.\" Trump could have a stronger case against the women themselves \u2013 but, like Cosby before him, Trump would get a lot more than he bargained for. To prove defamation, the statement in question must be false, harmful, and public. These statements obviously fulfill the second and third requirements \u2013 but what about the first? Let\u2019s assume, for the sake of argument, that ultimately, the question of truth will come down to he said\/she said. Doubtless, Trump\u2019s lawyers will do their best to paint these accusers \u2013 and the many others who have already come forward \u2013 as opportunists, or sluts, or liars, or worse. They will argue that these incidents never happened, and that the women defamed Mr. Trump by saying that they did. That will be a nasty process, to be sure, but the women won\u2019t be on their own. Well-known attorney Gloria Allred, who has represented dozens of women in sexual harassment cases over the years, has already been in contact with several of the women involved. And while she did not comment on individual cases, Allred told The Daily Beast: \u201cMr. Trump's threat to sue the New York Times is outrageous. What about freedom of the press? Did Mr. Trump forget about the First Amendment or does he only talk about the amendments that he likes? He is trying to shut down a free press in this country and every citizen should speak out and protest that.\u201d Meanwhile, if Trump sues, every single thing Trump has ever said about women, from the Access Hollywood video to the Howard Stern tapes, would be admissible as evidence. Just what we\u2019ve seen so far is quite damning. If it\u2019s a case of he said\/she said \u2013 well, he boasted to Billy Bush that he kisses women non-consensually and \u201cgrabs them by the pussy\u201d all the time. Worse still for Trump, the accusers would, as part of the discovery process, likely be able to obtain tapes that we haven\u2019t even seen yet \u2013 first and foremost, those rumored tapes from the Apprentice series that include Trump using racial slurs. All of these would enter the public record. Oh, and there\u2019s more. As with the Cosby case, every single woman that Trump has kissed since his clubbing days at Studio 54 would now be a potential character witness. These women may be barred from filing their own claims of sexual assault, either by statutes of limitations or by high evidentiary standards, but they\u2019ll be quite free to testify to any encounters they\u2019ve had with Trump. In sum, while Trump could harass these women and cost them some money, everything he\u2019s ever said about or done to women will come to light. And as we pointed out in the Cosby context, this sort of hubris has cost other men their freedom, including Oscar Wilde, who sued his (male) lover\u2019s father for libel even though Wilde knew that the events in question had taken place. Even if Trump has a different memory of his contested events, it would be very, very stupid for him to follow a similar path. Either his lawyer is bluffing, or Trump is out of his mind.","label":1}
{"text":"The Vigilante Faking WikiLeaks Docs to Dupe Trump Trolls: Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast If you\u2019re not paying attention, it looks like a smoking gun\u2014 a leaked expense report tying Hillary Clinton to the media\u2019s most powerful groups. The numbers from the supposedly leaked document\u2014printed out and marked up with a highlighter, for good measure\u2014are damning: $75,000 directly from the Clinton Foundation to polling firm Public Policy Polling. Over $333,000 sent, somehow, to the Black Panthers. Then the kicker: $30,000 to the \u201cSharia Law Center.\u201d Of course, the whole thing is totally fake. The header for the page, \u201cVoter Suppression,\u201d probably should\u2019ve given it right away. But for Trump supporters on Twitter and Facebook, a Fox News contributor, and even radio hosts like Hal Turner, it is still very much real to them. Chris from Massachusetts (who declined to give his last name) got \u2019em again. He\u2019s spent all week trying to assuage anyone responding to his tweet with doubts about the paper\u2019s veracity that it is the truest WikiLeak of all. Since the release of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta\u2019s emails by WikiLeaks and Donald Trump\u2019s lewd Access Hollywood conversation, Chris is one of many useful trolls creating intentional, immediately obvious disinformation\u2014that will still dupe a too-large subset of devotees. Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin, who is now polling above 20 percent in Utah, had to put out a statement Saturday denying that he took $12,000 from the Clinton Foundation. \u201cI have no relationship to the Clinton Foundation. I oppose both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump,\u201d he said. McMullin\u2019s campaign even had to put up a section on his official website to denounce the printout, on which McMullin called \u201c The Dumbest Meme on the Internet.\u201d Glenn Beck, who earned a cool hundred-grand in this fictional land, even had to block out time in his podcast this weekend to mock it. Still, the web raged on. \u201cSharia Law? Glenn Beck? Bill Ayers? Black Lives Matter? ACORN? Public Polling?\u201d asked Trump supporter @DebbGV on Twitter. \u201cWhat exactly is this money being paid out for???\u201d Chris, who goes by MassRafTer on Twitter, has been duping Trump supporters with intentionally impossible-to-believe fake leaked documents for a few months now. \u201cThe wonderful thing is this is the third time 55 dipshits per minute have fallen for my Photoshop and MSPaint work,\u201d Chris told The Daily Beast. His most high-profile escapade was a fake internal memo by Public Policy Polling that showed the Clinton campaign reprimanding the survey company over how poor it is at collusion. \u201cYour latest poll is unacceptable. We aren\u2019t paying you $760,000 per month to show a FIVE POINT LEAD. Are you trying to make Trump win?\u201d it reads. \u201cWe will be ending our contract with your company unless results improve quickly.\u201d The stunt landed the fake memo on far-right message boards and merited a mocking two-minute segment on MSNBC\u2019s All In With Chris Hayes. Even Donald Trump Jr. retweeted it\u2014before later deleting it. Turns out Chris was a pioneer. \u201cThe first one was made to be as fake looking as possible just to see if people would buy it. Now 90 percent unbelievable would be a good number,\u201d Chris said. \u201cSo I made the new one a greatest hits of Obama and Clinton conspiracies with stuff like Larry Sinclair to make it extra obvious.\u201d Sinclair is, according to a fabricated right-wing conspiracy theory, Barack Obama\u2019s gay lover and drug peddler from the \u201990s. Still, thousands of people\u2014and counting\u2014bought Chris\u2019s fake posts. Take self-professed Trump supporter @OMFG_America, who went by @Anthony_VVeiner until Wednesday afternoon, and whose bio says his \u201chobbies include shitposting, tweeting fake news, and romantic walks on the beach.\u201d Weeks ago, he posted what he alleged was Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine yelling at his 11-year-old daughter in a leaked voicemail. By Wednesday, when the post picked up steam, the \u201cleak\u201d had over 2,000 retweets. The audio, however, was Alec Baldwin\u2019s infamous freakout from 2007, which made national news in April of that same year. Even Paul Joseph Watson of pro-Trump conspiracy website Infowars, where articles regularly appear declaring the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks an inside job, took to Twitter to refute it. \u201cStop circulating that \u2018Tim Kaine\u2019 voicemail. It\u2019s not him, it\u2019s Alec Baldwin,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhy are some resorting to hoaxes when we have real WikiLeaks?\u201d @OMFG_America later deleted the tweet, plus all of his tweets insisting it was real, and retweeted Watson. The user didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment from The Daily Beast. Chris, in the meantime, thinks he\u2019s doing a minor public service\u2014to get people be a little more discerning with random \u201cleaks\u201d and pieces of paper floating around the Internet. \u201cConspiracy-theory nonsense drives me crazy, as do the random Facebook political hoaxes you see every day,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to think people who aren\u2019t in a true-believer camp feel embarrassed when they fall for something obviously fake, and then think twice the next time.\u201d If Trump sought to blur reality in an effort to give legitimacy to illegitimate conspiracy theories, Chris is doing the opposite. He\u2019s trying to hold a mirror up to those who immediately accept any information that conforms to precisely what they want to believe\u2014no matter how unbelievable it may be. \u201cMaybe, just maybe the true believers who retweet this stuff gleefully look a little less credible every time,\u201d he said. His own bullshit has even served to reinforce more bullshit in the far-right message boards that thrive on leaks and anonymous posts with no attribution. \u201cTrump supporters use these for their own, or cite my previous hoaxes to prove new ones are real,\u201d he added. In the meantime, all Chris asks is for you to do the absolute bare minimum: Make one extra click before you retweet. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s funnier, the people who believe it\u2019s real, or the people who don\u2019t take 10 seconds to see if I think it\u2019s real, and debunk it to me,\u201d he said. Otherwise, disinformation can get out of hand, fast\u2014just the way some people want it.","label":1}
{"text":"A President Clinton would be out of control: Glenn Reynolds: He's no paragon of virtue, but it won\u2019t be that way with a President Trump. \u201cSomeone somewhere should have told her no.\u201d Those are the words of a Clinton ally quoted in a roundup of Democratic reactions to Hillary Clinton\u2019s FBI news by congressional newspaper The Hill. And, despite the fact that they come from a Clinton supporter, albeit an angry and disappointed one, they may illustrate the best reason for choosing Donald Trump instead of Clinton. Here\u2019s the full quote:  \u201cI'm livid, actually. ... This has turned into malpractice. It's an unforced error at this point. I have no idea what (FBI Director) James Comey is up to but the idea this email issue is popping back up again is outrageous. It never should have occurred in the first place. Someone somewhere should have told her no. And they didn't and now we're all paying the price.\u201d  Someone, somewhere, should have told her no. Well, yes. But who? That was the problem with Secretary of State Clinton, and it will be a bigger problem with a President Clinton. Because, by all appearances, nobody tells Clinton no, and Clinton has no compunction about breaking the rules when it suits her purposes. Thus the Clinton Foundation became a global money-laundering and influence-peddling organization without precedent in American history. Donors to the foundation were encouraged to steer money to what one employee called \u201cBill Clinton, Inc.,\u201d and later to Bill Clinton. State Department personnel did favors for people who donated money to the foundation. And to make sure that nobody found out what was going on, Clinton ran her own home-brew email server operation designed to ensure that Freedom of Information Act requests turned up nothing \u2014 and even President Obama, rather than saying no, went along, sending her emails at her non-government address under a fake name. Someone somewhere should have told her no. But if the president didn't tell her no, who would? Staff at the State Department? They might have been willing to tell some other secretary of State no, but Clinton? Too risky, it seems. They certainly went along without visible objection, and without even leaks. The press? When The New York Times reported Clinton\u2019s secret server, Politico\u2019s Glenn Thrush, far from condemning it, called it \u201c badass.\u201d Congress? Clinton has stonewalled and run rings around numerous committees investigating her. Besides, Congress had already told her no, in the form of statutes governing the treatment of government communications and classified information. She just ignored those rules and did what she wanted. Hotel magnate Leona Helmsley famously said \u201conly little people pay taxes.\u201d Clinton seems to feel the same way about obeying laws. POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media It won\u2019t be that way with a President Trump. This isn\u2019t because Trump is any less arrogant than Clinton (though it would be hard to be more arrogant). It\u2019s because more people will be willing to tell Trump no. The civil service, which leans overwhelmingly Democratic, won\u2019t be bending over backwards to do his will. The press can\u2019t stand him. And Congress, even if controlled by the GOP, won\u2019t support him if he misbehaves because so many Republicans dislike him, too. The truth is, neither one of our leading candidates for president is a paragon of virtue. But only one of them has already made a habit of flouting the law while in office, selling favors and escaping the consequences, and only one of them is likely to be able to pull it off from the White House. And that\u2019s the problem. If Secretary of State Clinton, serving under a president and with an eye on winning a second term in the White House, wasn\u2019t constrained by the rules, who will constrain her if she\u2019s president? The answer, most likely, is nobody. And, once again, we\u2019ll all be paying the price.

{"text":"Endorsement: Hillary Clinton is the only choice to move America ahead: The Arizona Republic announces its editorial board presidential endorsement for 2016. The Republic (Photo: Dorothy Edwards\/Naples Daily News) Since The Arizona Republic began publication in 1890, we have never endorsed a Democrat over a Republican for president. Never. This reflects a deep philosophical appreciation for conservative ideals and Republican principles. This year is different. The 2016 Republican candidate is not conservative and he is not qualified. That\u2019s why, for the first time in our history, The Arizona Republic will support a Democrat for president. What Clinton has (and Trump doesn\u2019t) The challenges the United States faces domestically and internationally demand a steady hand, a cool head and the ability to think carefully before acting. Hillary Clinton understands this. Donald Trump does not. Clinton has the temperament and experience to be president. Donald Trump does not. Clinton knows how to compromise and to lead with intelligence, decorum and perspective. She has a record of public service as First Lady, senator and secretary of state. She has withstood decades of scrutiny so intense it would wither most politicians. The vehemence of some of the anti-Clinton attacks strains credulity. Trump hasn\u2019t even let the American people scrutinize his tax returns, which could help the nation judge his claims of business acumen. Her flaws pale in comparison Make no mistake: Hillary Clinton has flaws. She has made serious missteps. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while secretary of State was a mistake, as she has acknowledged. Donations to the Clinton Foundation while she was secretary of State raise concerns that donors were hoping to buy access. Though there is no evidence of wrongdoing, she should have put up a firewall. Yet despite her flaws, Clinton is the superior choice. She does not casually say things that embolden our adversaries and frighten our allies. Her approach to governance is mature, confident and rational. MORE: Why does The Republic endorse, anyway? That cannot be said of her opponent. Clinton retains her composure under pressure. She\u2019s tough. She doesn\u2019t back down. Trump responds to criticism with the petulance of verbal spit wads. That\u2019s beneath our national dignity. When the president of the United States speaks, the world expects substance. Not a blistering tweet. Whose hand do you want on the nuclear button? Hillary Clinton knows the issues, history and facts. Clinton has argued America\u2019s case before friendly and unfriendly foreign leaders with tenacity, diplomacy and skill. She earned respect by knowing the issues, the history and the facts. She is intimately familiar with the challenges we face in our relations with Russia, China, the Middle East, North Korea and elsewhere. She\u2019ll stand by our friends and she\u2019s not afraid to confront our enemies. Contrast Clinton\u2019s tenacity and professionalism with Trump, who began his campaign with gross generalities about Mexico and Mexicans as criminals and rapists. These were careless slaps at a valued trading partner and Arizona\u2019s neighbor. They were thoughtless insults about people whose labor and energy enrich our country. Trump demonstrated his clumsiness on the world stage by making nice with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto only a few hours before appearing in Phoenix to deliver yet another rant about Mexican immigrants and border walls. Arizona\u2019s been there on immigration (it doesn\u2019t work) What\u2019s more, Arizona went down the hardline immigration road Trump travels. It led our state to SB 1070, the 2010 \u201cshow me your papers\u201d law that earned Arizona international condemnation and did nothing to resolve real problems with undocumented immigration. Arizona understands that we don\u2019t need a repeat of that divisive, unproductive fiasco on the national level. A recent poll shows Arizonans oppose both more walls and the mass deportations Trump endorses. We need a president who can broker solutions. Clinton calls for comprehensive immigration reform, a goal that business, faith and law enforcement leaders have sought for years. Her support for a pathway to citizenship and her call for compassion for families torn apart by deportation are consistent with her longtime support for human rights. Clinton\u2019s equality vs. Trump\u2019s lack of respect Hillary Clinton has made a career fighting for gender equality. As secretary of state, Clinton made gender equality a priority for U.S. foreign policy. This is an extension of Clinton\u2019s bold \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights\u201d speech in 1995. It reflects an understanding that America\u2019s commitment to human rights is a critically needed beacon in today\u2019s troubled world. Trump\u2019s long history of objectifying women and his demeaning comments about women during the campaign are not just good-old-boy gaffes. They are evidence of deep character flaws. They are part of a pattern. Trump mocked a reporter\u2019s physical handicap. Picked a fight with a Gold Star family. Insulted POWs. Suggested a Latino judge can\u2019t be fair because of his heritage. Proposed banning Muslim immigration. Each of those comments show a stunning lack of human decency, empathy and respect. Taken together they reveal a candidate who doesn\u2019t grasp our national ideals. A centrist or a wild card? Many Republicans understand this. But they shudder at the thought of Hillary Clinton naming Supreme Court justices. So they stick with Trump. We get that. But we ask them to see Trump for what he is \u2014 and what he is not. Trump\u2019s conversion to conservatism is recent and unconvincing. There is no guarantee he will name solid conservatives to the Supreme Court. Hillary Clinton has long been a centrist. Despite her tack left to woo Bernie Sanders supporters, Clinton retains her centrist roots. Her justices might not be in the mold of Antonin Scalia, but they will be accomplished individuals with the experience, education and intelligence to handle the job. They will be competent. Just as she is competent. If a candidate can\u2019t control his words Trump\u2019s inability to control himself or be controlled by others represents a real threat to our national security. His recent efforts to stay on script are not reassuring. They are phony. The president commands our nuclear arsenal. Trump can\u2019t command his own rhetoric. Were he to become president, his casual remarks \u2014 such as saying he wouldn\u2019t defend NATO partners from invasion \u2014 could have devastating consequences. Trump has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, a thug who has made it clear he wants to expand Russia\u2019s international footprint. Trump suggested Russia engage in espionage against Hillary Clinton \u2014 an outrageous statement that he later insisted was meant in jest. Trump said President Obama and Hillary Clinton were \u201cco-founders\u201d of ISIS, then walked that back by saying it was sarcasm. It was reckless. Being the leader of the free world requires a sense of propriety that Trump lacks. Clinton\u2019s opportunity to heal this nation This is Hillary Clinton\u2019s moment to reach those who feel left behind. We understand that Trump\u2019s candidacy tapped a deep discontent among those who feel left behind by a changed economy and shifting demographics. Their concerns deserve to be discussed with respect. Ironically, Trump hasn\u2019t done that. He has merely pandered. Instead of offering solutions, he hangs scapegoats like pi\u00f1atas and invites people to take a swing. In a nation with an increasingly diverse population, Trump offers a recipe for permanent civil discord. In a global economy, he offers protectionism and a false promise to bring back jobs that no longer exist. America needs to look ahead and build a new era of prosperity for the working class. This is Hillary Clinton\u2019s opportunity. She can reach out to those who feel left behind. She can make it clear that America sees them and will address their concerns. She can move us beyond rancor and incivility. The Arizona Republic endorses Hillary Clinton for president.","label":1}
{"text":"These Shameless Donald Trump Surrogates Should Be Applauded For Their Loyalty: Following the leaked Access Hollywood audio from the early 2000s and his second terrible debate performance in a row, Donald Trump\u2019s prospects for becoming President grow more bleak with each passing day. Let\u2019s remember, however, that it was so long ago that he steamrolled his GOP competition and looked like he might be a formidable competitor. Trump couldn\u2019t have risen to the front of the Republican pack without a little help from his surrogates. There are dozens of talking heads bouncing from show to show and channel to channel banging the drum for the Donald. While every campaign has their partisans, Trump\u2019s supporters in the media have been some of the most dishonest blowhards ever to rise up in a field known for dishonest blowhards. As the sun sets on Trump\u2019s campaign, let\u2019s look back at the people who brought him this far. Here are the Most Shameless Trump surrogates. The Arkansas attorney general was trotted out by the Trump campaign once they decided Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelity could be a useful campaign smear. She dutifully made the rounds in the media claiming that Americans don\u2019t care about Trump\u2019s tax returns and that they want to talk about Clinton\u2019s sexual history. CBS\u2019s Bob Schieffer completely grilled her anecdotal evidence and legalistic posturing on a recent CBS appearance. He pressed her to admit she has no evidence for her claims, and there\u2019s nothing she could say to contradict him. Even by Fox News standards, Hannity has been an unabashed Trump supporter from the very beginning. He has even picked fights with co-workers like Megyn Kelly over their refusal to carry water for Trump. In this clip from a few days ago, he was quick to draw parallels between Bill Clinton and Donald Trump and downplay his words as \u201clocker room talk.\u201d Even before Donald Trump declared his candidacy, Ann Coulter was by his side. Several journalists have reported that conversations with Coulter and her book Adios, America directly shaped Trump\u2019s immigration policies. When Coulter talks about Trump, as in the clip above, she talks like he is the living embodiment of her hard line right wing ideas. No matter what Trump says or does, she stands by Trump\u2019s side, as long as he builds that wall. Few Trump surrogates are as artless as Pierson. She often speaks with the nuance of the necklace of bullets she likes to wear around her neck. She\u2019s been caught in lies on-air on several occasions, and rarely does a news cycle go by that she doesn\u2019t get herself in hot water. Back in December, she responded to concerns about Trump\u2019s Muslim ban by saying, \u201cSo what, they\u2019re Muslims.\u201d Often seen on CNN, McEnany was a lowly cog in the Fox News machine until she saw her opportunity to seize the limelight during this Trump-ified election cycle. Her resume is so lean that CNN often simply bills her as \u201cTrump Supporter\u201d when they invite her on their air. It doesn\u2019t take long to find video clips where she fails miserably at her Trump supporting high-wire act. Here\u2019s one instance of just such a stumble from an attempted reference to Martin Luther King Jr. on a panel last August. Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski landed at CNN following his ouster from the campaign after he was accused of assaulting a reporter. Obviously an ethical quagmire, Lewandowski\u2019s hiring became even more suspect when it was revealed that he was taking checks from Trump as \u201cseverence\u201d while posing as a media figure. His integrity is evident in the above recent CNN clip where he defends Trump\u2019s recent comments saying \u201cwe\u2019re not electing a Sunday school teacher.\u201d After tweeting an offensive cartoon depicting Hillary Clinton last summer, Burns, an African-American pastor who spoke at the GOP convention, was quietly shuffled off of the Trump surrogate circuit. Trump couldn\u2019t successfully distance himself from Burns fast enough; the pastor brought the campaign trouble again when it was revealed that he wasn\u2019t who he claimed to be. Burns falsified aspects of his biography including claims of an Army reserve record and college graduation, raising further questions about the firebrand preacher. New Hampshire representative and Trump veterans coordinator suggested that Hillary \u201cshould be put on the firing line and shot for treason\u201d several months ago. When given the chance to walk back the comment, he doubled down on his remarks. He also called Khizr Khan, father of a slain gold star American soldier, a \u201cMuslim Brotherhood agent\u201d after Khan gave a moving speech at the DNC When called out for his controversial statements, Baldasaro has repeatedly blamed the left wing media for distorting his words, when in fact, they had been quoting him verbatim. Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani has been one of Trump\u2019s most loyal surrogates. Early this year, he invited people to take unfounded conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health as truth when he said, \u201cGo online and put down \u2018Hillary Clinton illness.\u2019 Take a look at the videos for yourself.\u201d Giuliani\u2019s relentless, reckless defense of Trump has continued through his recent troubles. When other Trump surrogates ducked scrutiny this past weekend, Giuliani jumped on the chance to make all five Trump media appearances slated for Sunday morning. Chuck Todd battered him on Meet the Press, but we have no reason to believe he won\u2019t be back for more. Perhaps the most shameless supporter of Donald Trump has been New Jersey governor Chris Christie. After exchanging heated bluster with Trump throughout the primary season, Christie began supporting Trump with a press conference that reminded Twitter of Game of Thrones. And no, he didn\u2019t look like John Snow. Tea Party mainstay Scottie Nell Hughes has been a loyal Trump defender throughout the election. She has been forced to defend riots and sexual harassment on behalf of Donald Trump, among other egregious policies and statements from the Donald. As if this wasn\u2019t enough indignity for her to suffer on Trump\u2019s behalf, Ana Navarro recently roasted Hughes for suggesting she was offended by Navarro using the word \u201cp-ssy\u201d when quoting Trump. It seems that these surrogates have no shame, but in this election cycle, Trump is truly testing the limits of even the most craven surrogates.

{"text":"St. Louis Mayor's Home Surrounded and Vandalized by Protestors: St. Louis police are geared up for a second night of upheaval after protests swelled and stormed the city's old courthouse, overtook the downtown streets, flooded such business centers as West County Mall, and left destruction in their trail, with at least one police cruiser being vandalized and 10 officers being treated for injuries by nightfall on Friday, September 15. Before dispersing, an enraged group that had splintered off from an earlier demonstration over the acquittal of officer Jason Stockley in his trial for the murder of Anthony Lamar Smith descended upon the home of St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson. It is estimated that a crowd of nearly 1,000 were followed to the Mayor's home by riot police, who would eventually deploy tear gas and make arrests after Krewson's windows were shattered and building doused with paint. The protesters responded by tossing rocks and bricks at the officers. Other properties along the Central West End neighborhood were reportedly vandalized as well. Nearly three dozen arrests had been made heading into the late hours of Saturday. Due to the threat of rioting, numerous businesses shot down and several events were canceled, including a U2 concert and an Ed Sheeran show that had been scheduled to take place.","label":0}

{"text":"Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones Confronted Over Stance on Anthem Protests: Recently, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones made waves after stating that any Cowboys player who does anything \"disrespectful to the flag\" would not play. His comments followed the continuing bashing of the NFL by President Trump, who believes players who kneel during the national anthem are disrespecting the country. However, on Tuesday, October 17, while making his way to an NFL owners meeting, Jones faced harsh criticism for his remarks by protestors. In the clip circling the web, Carl Dix, an African-American man, and Linda Solotaire, a white woman, spotted Jones and his Stephen and daughter Charlotte in the Conrad New York lobby and the pair were not shy about unloading on the owner. \u201cYou want to treat them [players] like $40 million slaves. Gladiators who are well paid to beat each other\u2019s brains out, but they have to keep their mouths shut when talking about injustice.\" Dix said. \"Look at the videos of the police getting away with murder and tell me are wrong for protesting, and that they have no right to do that.\u201d The protesters add to the list of individuals who have come out against the stance of Jones. Recently, rapper and activist Common said Jones displayed a \u201cslave owner mentality\" towards players expressing their first amendment rights. Check out the video above.","label":0}

{"text":"The lie that is Hillary:  Illustration on Hillary Clinton\u2019s corrupt background by Alexander Hunter\/The Washington Times more &amp;gt; ANALYSIS\/OPINION: Many of us remember the classic line from the \u201cSeinfeld\u201d show, that \u201cit\u2019s not a lie if you believe it.\u201d Applying that theme to the evolution of Hillary Rodham, then Hillary Rodham Clinton, and now just plain Hillary Clinton, here are the notable accomplishments of her \u201cpublic service\u201d career: \u2022 Flunked the D.C. Bar Exam. \u2022 Was removed from her House Judiciary Committee staffer job because of incompetence and lying. \u2022 The Whitewater scandal. \u2022 Married a serial liar and cheater, who occasionally had sexual encounters with nonconsenting partners. \u2022 Lied about \u201csniper fire\u201d in an attempt to simulate exposure to danger in a war zone. \u2022 The subject of a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d that led to the impeachment and disbarment of her husband \u2022 Took crockery, furniture, artwork and other items from the White House \u2014 had to return and\/or pay for them. \u2022 Said \u201cwhat difference, at this point, does it make\u201d about four brave people killed in Libya as a direct result of her failure to protect them on the anniversary of 9\/11. \u2022 Totally ignored the structure and rules for the handling of sensitive national security information. \u2022 Amassed a personal fortune with \u201cspeaking fees\u201d and payments from private sector political donors and foreign governments into transparent \u201cfoundations\u201d in obvious exchange for future political favor. Two conclusions emerge from this nefarious list of \u201caccomplishments\u201d: First, Hillary\u2019s brief solo \u201cprofessional\u201d career [without Bill] was a total failure, and of her own doing. This despite high-level political sponsorship to get her a key \u201centry level\u201d job as a legal staffer on the Nixon Impeachment investigation in the early 1970s. But she flunked the D.C. Bar Exam [perhaps the easiest in those days] and got fired from her staff job. Second, she is identified today in friendly media solely by her \u201ccareer\u201d post-marriage to Bubba. This is the part that Barack Obama recently described as making her \u201cprobably the best qualified person ever to run for president.\u201d This is both laughable and ironic, as she is better qualified than was Mr. Obama, arguably the most unqualified person ever elected president. And, as presidential aspirants go, they had one professional \u201cqualification\u201d in common: Neither had ever worked in a \u201creal job.\u201d After she and Bill left the White House [along with the furniture, crockery and art work they took with them] she simply punched her ticket with two more political gigs that were handed to her. Neither of which identify her as anything but an opportunist, saying and doing whatever necessary to perpetuate her \u201cnew\u201d political career, this while biding her time until she could run for president \u2014 twice. Her time as a senator from New York was purely a block-checking exercise to stay \u201crelevant.\u201d Best illustrating this is the question: Why didn\u2019t they go back to Arkansas? Easy, returning to Arkansas would have been the political \u2014 and financial \u2014 end for them and they knew it. It\u2019s the same reason the Obamas are not returning to Chicago. And in this context, look for an \u201cObama Foundation\u201d that rakes in money and a series of Hillary-style political appointments for Michelle \u2014 after all, she flunked the Bar Exam too. More than anything else, Hillary\u2019s campaign is counting on the \u201cnewer\u201d American voters to simply not remember her and Bill\u2019s checkered political and legal past. Accordingly, we can expect a Republican campaign replay of the 1990s: Bill\u2019s Impeachment, the Star investigation, Bill\u2019s disbarment for lying, her Rose Law Firm partner going to jail \u2014 and on and on and on \u2014 as supplemented by her latest scandals: Benghazi, \u201cspeaking\u201d fees and classified emails. So, is Hillary \u201creally\u201d qualified to be president, or is it just a lie she believes after so many years with \u201cslick Willy\u201d and a series of political jobs? Sadly, her flakey \u201cqualifications\u201d may not matter at all \u2014 because if she wins, it will likely be a repeat of the 1992 election debacle: Remember that Bill would never have been elected had it not been for the third party \u201cspoiler\u201d candidacy of H. Ross Perot, who took 20 million votes away from George H.W. Bush \u2014 literally giving the election away and beginning the Clinton protracted political soap opera we are still dealing with. Will it happen again? Will the latest rupture in the Republican Party work to elect \u201ccrooked Hillary,\u201d the other half of the Clinton sleaze team? Will horny old Bill \u2014 again \u2014 be on \u201cintern patrol\u201d in the White House and \u201cfeeling our pain\u201d? These are the \u201ctruthful\u201d parts of the lie that have most of us saying: \u201cis this really the best we can do?\u201d. \u2022 Daniel Gallington frequently writes about national security.

Last summer I was at a dinner in London. The crowd was mostly composed of Americans and Brits. Britain had just voted for Brexit, and since it was also an election year in the States, politics and other cultural issues were natural topics of conversation. Eventually, gun violence in America came up. The British book editor sitting next to me said, \"I don't understand guns in America. It makes no sense to me.\" The other non-Americans all agreed. My fellow Americans and I at the table were at a loss for words. The only answer that was given by an American was, \"Neither do we.\" The Las Vegas shooting was the deadliest mass shooting in American history. The Brady Campaign states that there was an average of 11,500 deaths per yearbetween 2011 and 2015. According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have already been more than 11,000 deaths in the United States caused by gun violence in 2017. Compare that to the average one death of an American per year at the hands of Islamic extremists. Beyond Otto Warmbier, how many Americans have been killed in the last decade due to North Korea? I had a hard time finding any. And yet here at home, when thousands die each year, when almost 60 people can be killed and 500 injured by another American with firearms, nothing will be done.

{"text":"Report: Cowboys players plan anthem protest for Monday night: Dallas Cowboys players, along with owner Jerry Jones locked arms during the national anthem before Monday night's game in Arizona. Before the anthem, the team took a knee together. The public address announcer at University of Phoenix Stadium addressed the crowd before the anthem, saying Cardinals players would lock arms during the playing of the song. \"Our players, owners and coaches will now meet in the south end zone and lock arms in a sign of unity,\" he said. \"Fans, we honor our nation's flag and the men and women of our armed forces who have sacrificed so much to protect our freedoms. We invite you to unite as well, and do the same with your fellow fans, regardless of jersey color.\" Cowboys players locked arms along their sideline as Jordin Sparks sang the anthem. Earlier Monday, the Star-Telegram reported that Cowboys players planned to stage some form of protest during the national anthem before the game. No specific plans were revealed before the game. \u201cWe have to do something,\u201d one player told the Star-Telegram\u2019s Clarence Hill. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be business as usual,\u201d said another. \u201c[President Trump] crossed a line. Something will be done.\u201d Trump over the weekend blasted NFL players who protest during the national anthem, saying owners should \u201cfire or suspend\u201d them. He continued the assault Monday morning. A majority of teams released statements denouncing the president\u2019s comments, and the on-field response across the league Sunday was unprecedented. Every team had at least one player take part in some form of protest during the anthem. Nineteen teams saw a combination of players kneeling, locking arms or the like. Five more locked arms as a group with no players kneeling. Three teams -- the Seahawks, Titans and Steelers -- opted not to take the field for the anthem altogether. The NFL rule book doesn't require players to be on the field for the anthem, and the league has already stated those teams won\u2019t be punished.  19 tms had a combo of players who knelt\/locked arms\/etcNYG, PHI, WAS, NE, BUF, MIA, DEN, LAC, KC, OAK, DET, CLE, BAL, NO, TB, ATL, IND, JAC\u2014 Mike Leslie (@MikeLeslieWFAA) September 25, 2017   Five teams - #Jets, #Vikings, #Bears, #Bengals,  ; #Texans - linked arms as a sign of solidarity  ; support.

WFAA confirmed a report from Mike Fisher of 105.3 The Fan that owner Jerry Jones and the team's leadership council, a group of veteran players, were working on a \"unified statement\" on anthem protests. Draya Michele, the fianc\u00e9e of Cowboys cornerback Orlando Scandrick, posted a cryptic message to Snapchat Sunday saying \u201csome players aren\u2019t \u2018allowed\u2019 to kneel.\u201d She didn\u2019t provide clarification on the message. Activist Shaun King wrote that players had told him they would be on a \"sh*tlist\" if they protested. On Monday, however, Clarence Hill of the Star-Telegram reported that players had not been told not to protest and any report indicating anything else is inaccurate. Last month, Jones said in a radio interview that he \u201cfeels very strongly\u201d about players standing at attention during the anthem. \u201cRecognizing the flag is a salute to our country and all of the people that have sacrificed so that we have the liberties that we have,\u201d Jones he told 105.3 The Fan. \u201cI feel very strongly that everyone should save that moment for the recognition of the flag and in a positive way.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time Jones voiced an opinion against the anthem protests in the NFL. He commended his players last year for not choosing the anthem as a time to protest. It should be noted, though, that there is no evidence to support a viral UConservative.net article that claims Jones told players they would be \u201coff the team\u201d if they protested the national anthem. Governor Greg Abbott tweeted a link to the article last month, thanking Jones.","label":0}
{"text":"The anti-Semitism we hoped to never see again: Column: An ugly narrative of hatred from the left and the right that's untethered to normative reality. Just one day after the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, Donald Trump was talking about \u201cinternational banks\u201d and \u201cglobal financial powers.\u201d His race against Hillary Clinton, he said in West Palm Beach, Fla., \u201cwill determine whether we're a free nation, or whether we have only an illusion of democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of special global interests rigging the system ... The establishment and their media neighbors wield control over this nation through means that are very well known.\u201d Those who are familiar with the language of anti-Semitism have seen this particular trope before: Hitler used it to great effect. The only difference is that Hitler was honest enough to pinpoint the \u201csmall handful\u201d as being composed of Jews. It\u2019s been decades since the motley American Jewish community has been deeply unsettled by anti-Semitism. But such is the state of things that even at my own synagogue, in an idyllic, leafy, and largely progressive New Jersey suburb, the rabbi wrapped a sermon around it. An adult student came to him with great anguish, asking for guidance about how Jews might respond to what he described as growing violence and increasingly freer expressions of hate. His answer: compassion and loving-kindness, as prescribed by the Torah. But compassion and loving-kindness have not been front and center for some time. In fact, a certain brand of Jew-hatred, one that is tinged not with right-wing paranoia but with left-wing sanctimony, has for some years now been quite the in-thing on American campuses. Undergraduates at some of our most prestigious universities and colleges in the nation, gathering under the banner of progressive humanism, have taken to barring Hillel (the largest student Jewish organization operating in the United States) from taking part in campus events that have nothing whatsoever to do with religious, ethnic, or national issues, and demonizing Israel. Yup: It\u2019s back, and not only is it back but becoming fashionable. I\u2019m not talking about Europe, where anti-Semitism from the left has long been ascendant, but America. The most recent movement to join this swelling chorus of hatred on the left is \u2014 tragically, I think\u2014 Black Lives Matter, which recently adopted a platform charging Israel with genocide. Not ISIL ( thousands of Yazidis murdered). Not North Korea (where untold millions, including children, have been killed by famine, imprisonment in slave camps, and torture.) Not Syria, where Bashar Assad's forces continue to kill Syrian citizens by the hundreds of thousands. Nope: it\u2019s Israel that some misguided folks at Black Lives Matter have singled out for accusations of genocide, even though Israel applies capital punishment only for crimes against humanity, and in practice Israel hasn\u2019t sought the death penalty in decades. In other words, Israel, alone among the nations in its neighborhood, has never practiced state-sponsored bloodshed. But none of that matters: not the facts, not the figures, not the bloody history of Israel\u2019s neighbors, not the bloody history of Europe, not that Israel was born out of desperation, not any of it \u2014 because that\u2019s how it is with anti-Semitism, whether from the left or the right. Because when it comes to hating Jews, normative reality has nothing to do with it. The only thing that matters is the narrative of hatred. Given the current license-to-hate climate, it's no surprise that the number of anti-Semitic assaults, while hardly in league with those suffered by Jews under fascist or militaristic regimes, has suddenly swerved upwards. Last year, a Jewish frat house at Emory University was defaced with swastikas, while in liberal Madison, Wis., some 30 Jewish homes were similarly defaced. The number of anti-Semitic assaults has gone up \u2014 dramatically \u2014 from coast to coast. Many synagogues have been vandalized, spray-painted, or subjected to bomb threats. And legions of apparently anti-Semitic Trump supporters have targeted Jewish journalists with everything from vulgarity to threats, and nary a discouraging word from their loud-mouthed hero. \u200b POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media Look, I myself am a dyed-in-the-wool liberal, a tree-hugger, a lover of all-things-Obama, and a card-carrying member of the ACLU to boot. But when it comes to sheer outright Jew-hatred, I simply don\u2019t see any difference between anti-Semitism coming from the right, as in the case of Nazi Germany or Saudi Arabian propaganda depicting Jews as bloodthirsty child-murderers, or from the left, as in the case of the BDS movement (Boycott, Divest, and Sanction) now raging on American campuses. After the Holocaust, anti-Semitism wasn\u2019t supposed to be something to worry about. Sure, the civilized world thought: there\u2019d always be your occasional anti-Semitic nut-job. Nut-jobs happen. But outright, pure, public and organized antisemitism? Hard to fathom. Not here, in America. Not in post-war, Europe, either. And yet, chaverim, like Freddy Krueger in the Halloween movie franchise, it\u2019s baaaaack! There\u2019s a photo making its way around the internet of an elderly woman holding up a sign that says: \u201cI cannot believe I still have to protest this s--t.\" The \u201cs--t\u201d in question is the rash of anti-woman laws and restrictions that have been fielded in recent years, including a push to shut off funding for Planned Parenthood. And sure, the sign is funny. But it also points to something most of us know but don\u2019t want to: When it comes to quelling hatred, you can never rest.

[READ MORE: GUILTY: Judge rules in former Sheriff Joe Arpaio's criminal contempt case] During his rally at the Phoenix Convention Center on Tuesday night, Trump said he didn't want to pardon Arpaio because he didn't want \"to cause any controversy.\" Trump said he was found guilty of criminal contempt for \"just doing his job.\" He added, \"I think he's going to be just fine.\" U.S. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) released the following statement today on President Trump\u2019s pardon of former Sheriff Joe Arpaio:  \u201cNo one is above the law and the individuals entrusted with the privilege of being sworn law officers should always seek to be beyond reproach in their commitment to fairly enforcing the laws they swore to uphold.

Today, President Trump has undermined the rule of law by pardoning him. This is not a \"law and order\" presidency.

The victim, identified as Nandini, alleged foul play at the end of the police, stating that she felt 'trapped' in the situation as no action was taken against the alleged illegal cow mafia, as promised to her upon reporting the activity. Describing the entire incident, Nandini said: \"We noticed illegal beef shops when we had gone on a visit to the area. 14 cows were tied there, out of which two calves were being taken to a small room in a nearby area for slaughter. Being animal lovers, we rushed to the nearest police station in Talaghattapura and gave a complaint. We were assured that action was being taken, and police officers were deployed in the area.\" \"Since I was getting no updates, I proceeded to the spot with a co-complainant and two police constables in my car itself, since no police vehicle was available. Upon reaching the spot, I saw a mob gathered there, and assumed that there would be police too, as promised. However, there was nobody, and I felt like I was trapped. The mob started hurling concrete blocks, boulders and glass bottles from all directions, screaming pro-Pakistan slogans. It was the worst experience of my life,\" she added. Nandini's car was also severely damaged by the mob.\"I didn't expect to come out alive of this incident. 150-200 people gathered within minutes, trying everything to harm us.

{"text":"Trump says Comey knew he was going to exonerate Clinton: WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to revive his long-standing complaint about the FBI\u2019s handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation, alleging that then-Director James Comey had protected the Democratic presidential nominee by prematurely \u201cexonerating\u201d her before the 2016 election. \u201cComey stated under oath that he didn\u2019t do this \u2014 obviously a fix?\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWhere is Justice Dept?\u201d Trump\u2019s latest online burst came in response to the FBI\u2019s release of heavily blacked out draft statements from May 2016 by Comey in preparation for closing the Clinton investigation without criminal charges. Trump tweeted that the draft statements, whose existence was previously known, show the FBI had exonerated \u201cCrooked Hillary Clinton\u201d long before the investigation was complete. He tweeted: \u201cJames Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!\u201d In interview excerpts released in August by the Senate Judiciary Committee, FBI officials said Comey and investigators had determined by the spring of 2016 that charges weren\u2019t warranted, and had begun thinking of how the public should be informed of that decision. Clinton was interviewed by the FBI in early July, just days before Comey announced the investigation\u2019s conclusion. That timing has prompted criticism that FBI leadership had prejudged the conclusion before completing the investigation. When Comey announced the end of the case last year, he said the FBI had found no evidence that anyone intended to violate laws governing classified materials, which it considered a prerequisite for bringing a case. He said the FBI had thoroughly investigated the case for a year before deciding to conclude it. \u201cWe went at this very hard to see if we could make a case,\u201d Comey told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee days after announcing his recommendation that Clinton not face charges. Trump, as both a candidate and now president, has long complained about the FBI\u2019s handling of the email case, though his criticism has varied. He initially cited Comey\u2019s actions in the investigation as a basis for Comey\u2019s firing in May, though Trumo later acknowledged that he was determined to replace the FBI director even without the recommendation of the Justice Department. The president complained again after Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released excerpts of interviews with FBI officials close to Comey. Those interviews showed that draft statements to close out the Clinton investigation had begun circulating among a tight circle of FBI officials in the spring of 2016. The interviews were conducted by officials from the Office of Special Counsel who were trying to determine if Comey\u2019s actions had violated a federal law that bars government officials from using their positions to influence an election. That investigation was closed following Comey\u2019s firing by Trump in May. ___ Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/etuckerAP","label":0}
{"text":"Are vehicle attacks the new form of terrorism?: The fact that vans are are easily accessible and they do not require much of a background check has been one of the main reasons for an increase in vehicle terror attacks. PHOTO: REUTERS The horrific events this week in Spain and Finland are a tragic recurrence of major terror incidents in the western nations. Once more we bear witness to the sort of nihilistic savagery that indiscriminately murders innocents with impunity. Let us be very clear about this. Those who carried out these attacks are not just murderers, they are immoral ingrates who have slaughtered the citizens of a nation that took them in and gave them the opportunities their own countries had failed to provide them. In 2017 alone, there have been numerous terror attacks involving vehicles. From the London Bridge attack, to the Drottninggatan, Stockholm attack to the Paris attack to the Barcelona attack \u2013 they keep increasing in number and we are helpless against them. Vehicles are constantly being submerged into crowds and we are motionless against them. The fact that vans are are easily accessible and they do not require much of a background check has been one of the main reasons for an increase in vehicle terror attacks. Furthermore, they are also cheap, cause great damage and are a convenient way to flee the scene. It is evident that vehicle terror attacks are slowly replacing suicide bomb attacks due the aforementioned reasons. Not only must these criminals be punished, the trail that leads to their handlers, their financiers and their recruiters must be followed to the very end \u2013 no matter who they are or where they are. It is also time the world started to rethink its counter-terrorism policy because whatever has been done so far has not only failed, it has amplified the problem. For too long, the focus has been on the nebulous constructs of \u2018radicalisation\u2019 and \u2018ideology\u2019. I feel that chasing the smoke trails of dogma will achieve nothing unless the actual players in this grotesque parade of death and terror are neutered. This wild goose chase has protected from accountability the dictators and monarchs of the Middle East whose brutality and stifling of free speech has done nothing but incubated terrorism. It takes the attention away from the government and institutions \u2013 both political and religious \u2013 from Pakistan to Saudi Arabia, who champion sectarian and anti-western sentiment to suit their political needs. Over the years, it has allowed a glossing over of the role the 2003 invasion of Iraq played in creating the arena of chaos and the deluge of armaments that enabled the rise of Islamic State (IS). It leaves unscathed the internet cabal of IS recruiters who disseminate the atrocity exhibition of their propaganda videos globally. And they seem to have no problem in luring Muslim youth from all over the world and graduating them from some crash course in violent extremism. It is self-evident that the weapons, political intrigue and invasions of powerful nations are the immediate triggers for much of this modern violent extremism. But it is equally true that it is the disunity, intolerance and sectarian sentiment among Muslim societies that provides saboteurs the flames that they easily pour gasoline on. The song remains the same: It was \u2018divide and conquer\u2019 then, it is \u2018divide and conquer\u2019 now. It is that vile loathing of Muslims by Muslims that allowed the US and Israel to ship arms to both Iran and Iraq during their decade long bloody war. It was the existing ethnic and sectarian fault lines in Afghanistan and Pakistan that allowed the US and Russia to fight a proxy war through them for 11 years. This war gave these religiously-themed militias a grand stage with a global audience and kicked off a global jihadi enterprise that had never existed before. It was Iraq\u2019s asinine invasion that facilitated the first Gulf war. Al Qaeda claimed that the war and stationing of US troops near Hijaz was its primary reason for organising and attacking western targets. And it was the willingness of Gulf States to support \u2013 and the failure of the Muslim world at large to forcefully resist \u2013 the second Iraq invasion of 2003 that unleashed the unprecedented brutality of the group psychopathy known as Daesh. This never was or will be a clash between Islam and the West neither is it in any form or fashion a global pan-Islamic insurgency. What global agenda could those busy-slaughtering-their-own possibly pursue? In the final analysis, I believe this is a problem arising from the fractious societies and destructive leadership of Muslim majority nations. The fallout in the rest of the world is a direct outcome of the intrusion and positioning of the US, Europe and Russia into these conflicts through war and transfer of weaponry. A solution to global terrorism will be predicated on political reform in the Muslim world. For the citizens of these nations, unity is the only way tyranny, terrorism and imperialist ambition will be thwarted. Peace will remain a dream unless sectarian, tribal and ethnic divisions exist. For the West, the best possible course is to pressure their leadership to stop supporting and arming the most brutal regimes in the Muslim world and to cease their ambitions of exploitation and geopolitical game of chess. Interventionism has gained the world nothing but more bloodshed and strife. Just like Muslim nations must cease differentiating between good and bad terrorism, the West must stop justifying its hegemonic ambitions such as human rights or security contingencies.","label":0}

{"text":"Mike Pence: Donald Trump is ready to lead: Many voters don't have a clear image in their minds of major party vice presidential nominees Mike Pence and Tim Kaine, despite the nearness of the 2016 presidential election. Here's a look at their similarities and differences. (Dwight Adams\/IndyStar) Wochit (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) In fewer than 40 days, the American people will choose a new president who will set the course of this nation not only for the next four years, but for a generation to come. Between the candidates, the choice could not be more clear. By electing Donald Trump, the American people have the opportunity to choose a bold leader. In a political world often reserved for talkers, Donald Trump is a doer. I\u2019ve come to know the man who invited me to join him on the Republican ticket as thoughtful, compassionate and steady. Above all, I know he is ready to lead the United States as our next president and commander in chief. Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy embodies the status quo and the failed policies of Washington, D.C. With her we will get more of the same: more taxes, more spending, more regulation and more government. As Donald Trump and I crisscross the country, it has become clear to me that there is a movement building. This movement reminds me of the one built by a leader whom we now regard as one of our nation\u2019s greatest presidents. In 1980, Ronald Reagan was regarded by the Washington political establishment as little more than a cowboy or a celebrity who entered politics late in life. He even made some Republicans uneasy. Along the way, people heard his vision of a renewed America. Americans from all walks of life flocked to a man who was so clearly unbound by Washington niceties and political correctness. Ronald Reagan spoke the truth in 1980 to the American people, just as Donald Trump has in 2016. Donald Trump is a candidate who speaks honestly and frankly about the challenges we face. I have seen this good man come alongside those whose lives and property were ravaged by floodwaters in Louisiana. I have seen people pack arenas and fairgrounds by the thousands or stand in a driving rainstorm to hear the message of a brighter future. Donald Trump believes in the greatness of this country and the boundless potential of the American people. In recent months, Donald Trump has laid out a vision to improve America\u2019s standing at home and abroad. He will rebuild our military, defeat radical Islamic terror and reject the bad deals that jeopardize our security and that of our allies. At home, Donald Trump will empower the American people to revive our economy. He\u2019ll cut taxes for all Americans and halt onerous new federal regulations. He\u2019ll rewrite our trade deals so they help American workers. He\u2019ll end the war on coal and develop new American sources of energy. Donald Trump has committed to expanding educational choice for disadvantaged kids. He will repeal Obamacare and make health care more affordable and accessible. The next president will also set the course and direction of the Supreme Court for decades. To that end, Donald Trump will appoint men and women who will strictly construe the Constitution and not legislate from the bench. Our opponent stands in every way opposed to the change offered by Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton personifies why the American people have so little confidence in our political leaders. Over three decades in public life, we have grown accustomed to the hallmarks of the Clinton way. Wherever they go, issues of ethics and improprieties are not far behind. As Hillary Clinton tries to make her case for the highest office in the land, we hear from the FBI of cellphones smashed with hammers, wiped email servers and immunity deals for her closest advisers. She will raise taxes and put more burdensome regulations on business, ensuring our sluggish economy will remain just that. She has pledged to put coal miners out of business. More U.S. jobs will go overseas. The American people once again stand at a time for choosing. On one hand, we have a candidate in Hillary Clinton who represents all that is wrong with the status quo in Washington. On the other, Donald Trump has the courage to speak his mind and the boldness to make true his vision of a renewed America. On Election Day, the choice is clear. To Make America Great Again, we must elect Donald Trump the 45th president of the United States. Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana is the Republican nominee for vice president.","label":1}

{"text":"Democrats Worry About Hillary Clinton\u2019s Ground Game: Reuters As Donald Trump pulverized his own Republican Party on Twitter Tuesday afternoon, Congressional Democrats were having a conference call about how the election is shaping up in their states. A recent Wall Street Journal poll not only showed Trump cratering, it also revealed that congressional Democrats had widened their advantage over congressional Republicans to seven points. But the good vibes stopped when talk turned to Democrats\u2019 get-out-the-vote efforts. \u201cSomebody\u2019s got to talk to the Clinton campaign and get them to do better with it,\u201d one congressman said Several high-level Democrats who spoke to the Daily Beast are specifically concerned about Democrats\u2019 ground game, which they worry may not be enough to ensure a victory for Clinton and down ballot Democrats in such a tumultuous election year. The Clinton campaign has vastly outspent the Trump campaign on the air by five to one and boasts a ground game far superior to Trump\u2019s. But in the field especially, Clinton has never measured up to the operation put in place by Barack Obama in 2008 or 2012. Some Democrats worry that just being better than Trump may not be enough for down-ticket Democrats in close races in November. \u201cI am hearing from people that they are concerned about whether or not were properly or adequately funding our GOTV efforts,\u201d Rep. Jim Clyburn, the third ranking Democrat in the House, said in an interview with the Daily Beast. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some good GOTV plans. On paper they\u2019re great. The question is what about implementation? It\u2019s one thing to see what you need to do, it\u2019s something else to execute.\u201d Clyburn said he has been traveling extensively for Democratic candidates the country and heard worries about the Democratic ground game in multiple battleground states, including Colorado, where a breakfast with faith leaders turned into conversation about worries over the Democrats\u2019 GOTV effort there. \u201cI\u2019m really concerned about Florida, Colorado, and Ohio,\u201d Clyburn said. \u201cI just don\u2019t want us to spend all of our money on television, where people are now tuning out commercials, and not do what\u2019s necessary to turn people out.\u201d Rep. G.K. Butterfield, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said he has heard similar concerns and is specifically worried about the Clinton campaign\u2019s investment in African American communities. Butterfield noted they could make the difference in a state like his home of North Carolina, which President Obama lost by 14,000 votes in 2012. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we have been unsuccessful in being able to make the case for a significant investment in grassroots get out the vote,\u201d Butterfield said. \u201cOn the Clinton side and on the DSCC side, I\u2019ve been trying to get them to increase their commitment. They have made some investments, but it\u2019s not enough. \u201c So far, the Clinton campaign has spent about $21 million on television ads in the state, but far less than the $300,000 Butterfield says could turnout 50,000 African American voters there. \u201cI just want my friends who run national campaigns to know that it is the local communities that get the job done,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s an opinion that it\u2019s not a good investment and that opinion is flawed.\u201d The good news for Democrats is that the Clinton ground game is vastly superior to Donald Trump\u2019s. A FiveThirtyEight analysis shows that in terms of field offices, the Clinton operation is far outpacing Trump\u2019s. Clinton has 489 field offices nationwide, compared to 207 offices for Trump. Clinton\u2019s numbers don\u2019t come close to replicating the Obama operation, which had 789 field offices in 2012. The pattern holds for battleground states. In Florida, Clinton has 68 offices, compared to for 29 Trump, but 103 for Obama. In Virginia, Obama had 61 offices, compared to Clinton\u2019s 27 and Trump\u2019s 11. In Ohio, she has 75, while Trump has 22. Obama had 131 Ohio field office. \u201cBarack Obama had an army of volunteers in 2012. You could flip a switch and knock on one million doors in Florida in a weekend,\u201d said a Democratic operative involved in GOTV efforts for the party in 2008, 20012, and 2016. \u201cThere is no Hillary army. Not even close. In tight races, that matters.\u201d Democrats outside of the Clinton campaign are putting major cash into efforts to supplement GOTV in must-win states. Democratic mega-donor Tom Steyer gave an additional $15 million, on top of $5 million he\u2019d already sent, to For Our Future, a super PAC focused on expand Democrats\u2019 field operations in Florida, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Amanda Brown, the campaign director, said it is designed to turn out the Obama coalition that voted in 2008 and 2012, but skipped the mid-terms. \u201cVoters who many feared wouldn\u2019t show up this time\u2014unless we met them at the door and talked to them about the issues they were most concerned about.\u201d A Democrat familiar with the Clinton campaign acknowledged the differences between 2012 and this year, but said some of the changes are designed to help downballot races. \u201cIn 2012, there was no coordinated campaign, between the top of the ticket and the bottom,\u201d the source said. \u201cIn 2016, they\u2019re on all the literature. When Clinton does an event, they\u2019re all invited and included. It\u2019s a priority.\u201d As for House Democrats, Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi told the ones on the Tuesday call that she understood the concern about down-ballot races and has shared it with the Clinton campaign. \u201cWe have had that conversation with them to say, don\u2019t take anything for granted.\u201d","label":0}
{"text":"Michael Moore Is Worried About Hillary Clinton\u2019s Chances: \u2018The Lack of Enthusiasm Is Dangerous\u2019: Andy Kropa\/AP Iamges Michael Moore doesn\u2019t know if Donald Trump has seen his latest film, the anti-Trump documentary Michael Moore in TrumpLand, which the Fahrenheit 9\/11 filmmaker rushed out into theaters and VOD last week in an eleventh-hour attempt to give Team Hillary Clinton a boost in the final weeks before Election Day. But he was certainly none too happy to see the Republican presidential candidate tweet as if the film was a ringing endorsement\u2014which it definitely, absolutely, is not. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to him, so I don\u2019t know if he just saw his name in the title and thought it was pro-him,\u201d Moore told The Daily Beast on Monday from New York. \u201cWas he stupid enough to tweet that without anybody having watched the film? Or is he just crazy as a fox?\u201d Filmed over two nights in October, TrumpLand is a one-man stage show Moore began writing in August, spurred to action after seeing Democrats around him resting on their laurels a little too heavily following the Democratic convention. \u201cI noticed the people that support Hillary were feeling really confident\u2014and I thought that was dangerous,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe more Trump screwed up and the more she won the debates, people just thought more and more that it was in the bag. I didn\u2019t feel that way at all. I guess that\u2019s because I live in Michigan and I see what\u2019s going on and I\u2019m not in an East Coast-West Coast bubble.\u201d Moore\u2019s idea was to make a point by performing his stand-up show in a Republican city. But the first theater he booked, in the Ohio town of Newark, reneged under pressure from irate local Republicans. He ended up staging it in Wilmington, Ohio, \u201cwhich was even better because there are like 26,000 registered voters there and only 2,000 of them are registered as Democrats,\u201d he giggled. Even better: The Wilmington venue, a historic local 400-seat theater, was partially restored with a $50,000 donation from Glenn Beck five years ago. Moore laughs with gratitude. \u201cI do know that the theater took a lot of grief from the Republicans in their town\u2014and there was a state senator who called and threatened to have their arts funding canceled if they didn\u2019t cancel me.\u201d They didn\u2019t cancel. Eleven days later he premiered Michael Moore in TrumpLand in New York. Last weekend Miley Cyrus Instagrammed a selfie to her 1.2 million followers watching it, proclaiming \u201cI\u2019m with her!\u201d\u2014just the kind of viral support Moore was hoping for, aiming to rouse disappointed Bernie stumpers, undecided voters, non-voters, and third partiers leaning toward Trump to get excited about Hillary. \u201cIt\u2019s also for the Hillary voters who are not very excited,\u201d he added. \u201cThe lack of enthusiasm is dangerous.\u201d \u201cTen percent of the Hillary vote got depressed with the FBI announcement,\u201d he said, emphasizing that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t take any of it seriously at all.\u201d The damage made by FBI Director James Comey declaring that more Clinton emails are under review, Moore says, is that the \u201cirrelevant\u201d emails have dampened the enthusiasm Hillary\u2019s campaign still desperately needs. \u201cThey\u2019re still going to vote for her,\u201d he said of Clinton supporters, \u201cbut they\u2019re not as enthusiastic, and maybe won\u2019t do the work for her this weekend that they were going to.\u201d Moore\u2019s own position on Hillary has shifted dramatically over the years and through this election. He backed Bernie Sanders through the primary, dubbed Clinton \u201cWall Street\u2019s paid candidate,\u201d and said he couldn\u2019t vote for her on moral grounds because of her record on Iraq. That Moore disappeared sometime in the past few months. But he says he\u2019s always felt the same way about Hillary and her husband. \u201cI really don\u2019t think it has changed,\u201d he said of his stance on Clinton. \u201cI have a great deal of admiration for her. I felt that way back in the \u201990s. I didn\u2019t agree with her or Bill [Clinton] politically necessarily, but I didn\u2019t distrust who they were as human beings. And I feel the same way right now.\u201d \u201cI feel that her vote on the war was wrong. I feel she\u2019s too close to Wall Street. And I\u2019m also excited that we\u2019re going to elect the first woman president in our history.\u201d Moore stresses the historical significance of putting a woman in the White House, even after catching heat online for tweeting that \u201cno women ever invented an atomic bomb, built a smoke stack, initiated a Holocaust, melted the polar ice caps or organized a school shooting.\u201d The blowback didn\u2019t surprise Moore, who chalked some of the criticism to entrenched sexism from his fellow men. \u201cA lot of men are having a hard time with what\u2019s happening. A lot of white guys are having a hard time with it. Eight years of Obama were a huge blow [to them] and [electing a] woman is rattling around in their brains in a way that they can\u2019t make sense out of it.\u201d \u201cBut I only speak the truth,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t see a lot of girls going into schools and shooting them up. There are two exceptions in 35 years. So of course you have an anomaly, always, for anything. Margaret Thatcher would start a war. But as I pointed out in my last film talking to the first woman president in Iceland, she said, when you have just one woman it\u2019s a token and basically that person\u2019s going to behave much like men behave because that\u2019s how she got the token position. But when women have real power they don\u2019t behave that way. And I\u2019m not trying to say that women are better than men, I\u2019m just trying to say that\u2026 women are better than men!\u201d He considered the impact that third-party mobilization of millennials, in large part toward Sanders\u2019s campaign, has had on this election season. His fellow Bernie supporters should rally behind Hillary, Moore said. \u201cThat Hillary then, that we did not like at the beginning of the year, moved toward Bernie\u2019s position,\u201d he mused. \u201cShe adopted two-thirds of his platform! It\u2019s amazing. So I say to my fellow Bernie supporters, what more do you want? She\u2019s gone more than halfway! And she isn\u2019t Margaret Thatcher. What is your problem? Come on!\u201d \u201cThere should be no anger,\u201d he continued, his voice rising. \u201cThere should be joy, because we did something historic. We got a socialist elected in 22 states. Nearly half the states voted for a socialist for president. That is stunning! People shouldn\u2019t be angry\u2014they should be taking a bow. We set the tone of the whole election in terms of income inequality! If the Democrats win the Senate, the chairman of the budget committee is a guy named Bernie Sanders! A socialist will be in charge of the budget!\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re angry about any of that, you need to see somebody.\u201d Three days after distancing himself from Julian Assange on HBO\u2019s Real Time With Bill Maher in the wake of WikiLeaks\u2019s continued attacks on Clinton, Moore defended the organization and again called Assange an anarchist\u2014just like Trump. \u201cI think Julian and WikiLeaks perform a really important service and we can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe can\u2019t say it\u2019s OK when they expose the other side but not OK when they post things about our side. Having said that, I think that [Assange] and many of the people voting for Trump would like to see the system\u2014nonviolently\u2014blow up. I can see why Trump likes him, because Trump is essentially an anarchist. Trump is going to blow up the system with no plan for what he\u2019s going to replace what he\u2019s blown up. He has no real plans.\u201d Moore\u2019s touchstones for analyzing the tumultuous 2016 election, appropriately, parallel the viewing habits of America. It\u2019s how he\u2019s able to explain why he believes Trump has gotten this far in politics, the latest in a long lineage of Republican candidates plucked from show business to elected office. \u201cI watch Celebrity Apprentice,\u201d admitted Moore. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good show. Trump is a well-liked, very popular TV star. And one thing the Republicans have learned\u2014when they run Ronald Reagan, when they run Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2014when they run stars, they win. Democrats don\u2019t do that. We don\u2019t run Oprah or Tom Hanks or any of a number of other people that would win. I\u2019ve never understood that.\u201d Moore would, for the record, get behind President Oprah Winfrey. \u201cHell yes! And bring back her show every afternoon at 4 o\u2019clock from the Oval Office. How cool would that be?\u201d He urges the Democrats to learn from the savvier GOP and put all that Hollywood liberalism to good use. \u201cIt drives me crazy,\u201d said Moore. \u201cPart of it is because they don\u2019t understand popular culture, which is odd because Hollywood is so Democratic and so liberal\u2014and yet they don\u2019t understand their own power. In fact, they run from it when they get criticized. The American public loves Hollywood! There are three or four shows on at 7 p.m. about nothing but Hollywood news.\u201d \u201cI mean, listen,\u201d he began. \u201cJennifer Hudson lost American Idol, and most people think she won. She lost to Fantasia. Who the fuck is Fantasia, and where is she now? I mean, seriously\u2014anything can happen in this election. The American public is very fickle. Last year on The Bachelorette, everybody thought Kaitlyn was going to go for Nick, and she went with Shawn. That blew everyone\u2019s mind.\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s my warning about next Tuesday. We live in a country that loves The Bachelorette, Celebrity Apprentice, and American Idol; that sits in front of their TVs seven hours a day, and they do strange things. So take nothing for granted over the next eight days. Because this could go the wrong way very quickly.\u201d","label":0}
{"text":"Common: America\u2019s Racism Toward Black People Won\u2019t End With Donald Trump: Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast There is a sequence in 13th, Ava DuVernay\u2019s thorough examination of race in the U.S. criminal-justice system and the scourge of mass incarceration, that will hit close to home for Americans\u2014particularly viewers who are black.It intercuts footage of black people being pushed, pulled, and beaten in the streets during the civil-rights movement with that of black protesters being treated in a similar fashion during Donald Trump rallies. \u201cIn the good ol\u2019 days, this doesn\u2019t happen, because they used to treat them very, very rough\u2026 and when they protested once, they would not do it again so easily,\u201d Trump bellows in voiceover. Later on, he describes himself to his army of hysterical acolytes as the \u201claw and order\u201d candidate, borrowing a notorious phrase from disgraced ex-President Richard Nixon\u2014the godfather of mass incarceration. The footage had a profound effect on the Grammy-winning rapper Common, who penned the track \u201cLetter to the Free\u201d for DuVernay\u2019s film. It was his second collaboration with DuVernay, following his song \u201cGlory\u201d for the Martin Luther King, Jr. biopic Selma, which was awarded the Oscar for Best Original Song. \u201cI really thought about how this situation is affecting us right now, that\u2019s why I wrote Shot me with your ray-gun \/ And now you want to Trump me, and We staring in the face of hate again \/ The same they say will make America great again,\u201d says Common. \u201cWhen I heard Trump in his speech saying he was the \u2018law and order candidate,\u2019 it really resonated with me when it came to Nixon and the origins of mass incarceration.\u201d 13th indeed traces the birth of mass incarceration in the U.S. back to Nixon\u2019s War on Drugs, which targeted the enemies of the conservative right: hippies and black people. \u201cThe Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people,\u201d former Nixon domestic-policy chief John Ehrlichman later confessed to Harper\u2019s. \u201cWe knew we couldn\u2019t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\u201d And so the era of mass incarceration began\u2014one where, from 1980 to 2010, the U.S. prison incarceration rate exploded from 220 to 731 per 100,000 people, despite crime rates steadily declining since the \u201990s. The problem has affected black Americans the most: They represent approximately 37.8 percent of the U.S. prison population\u2014the most of any group. Non-Hispanic whites, by comparison, represent 32 percent of the prison population in America despite making up 62.6 percent of the country. 13th is named after the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which outlawed slavery, and posits that mass incarceration is a form of modern-day slavery for African Americans. \u201cNeither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction,\u201d reads the Thirteenth Amendment. Common had just finished reading Michelle Alexander\u2019s book The New Jim Crow when DuVernay informed him of the top-secret project. He expressed his desire to make a song for the film, and was met with a surprising response: \u201cOK, maybe you can submit a song. Let\u2019s see.\u201dSo he began writing \u201cLetter to the Free\u201d during the last week of July and into the first week in August, inspired by the divisive rhetoric of the Republican National Convention, as well as how the system has kept African Americans as second-class citizens\u2014from slavery to Jim Crow to now mass incarceration. \u201cI was influenced by this whole political climate, the conditions of mass incarceration, and the injustices going on that even allow us to have a group called Mothers of the Movement,\u201d offers Common. \u201cThey continue to drive me towards art that can be a part of the change.\u201d On the eve of the U.S. presidential election, I\u2019m seated across from the dapper rapper in an office in Midtown Manhattan. The talk soon veers back to that powerful Trump\/civil-rights movement montage, and how the Republican candidate has brought racism out of the shadows and into the light. \u201cI look at these things as finally surfacing and getting out in the open. Those negative forces weren\u2019t courageous enough to come out before because they didn\u2019t have any leader to latch on to,\u201d he says. \u201cYou take the racists in our country right now and see that they are supporting Trump, who has not shown any of the qualities to be a great leader, and you think, wow, he is unfit to be president. He\u2019s not even going to run the country better for them because he doesn\u2019t have the intelligence to be president.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cThe whole birther shit man, it\u2019s like, you are saying this to the president! What is your motive? Whose life will you benefit by doing this? It\u2019s just racism. President Obama is an exceptional human being, so there\u2019s only one reason and one explanation for all the hatred.\u201d Common, whose eleventh studio album, Black America Again, was released to critical acclaim last week, went on to admonish Trump\u2019s wacky band of surrogates for supporting a candidate they know to be unfit\u2014especially former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who\u2019s spouted one ridiculous statement after another this election season, including that he\u2019s \u201csaved more black lives\u201d than Beyonc\u00e9, which\u2026 huh?\u201cYou\u2019re going to lose all integrity for someone you know is not fit to be president? You\u2019re willing to lose your integrity, lie about things, and discredit other human beings for that reason? Giuliani says a lot of things about Black Lives Matter and it\u2019s like, man, you don\u2019t even care about these things, so why are you speaking on it?\u201d says Common. \u201cLook, we know it will be a bad situation if Donald Trump becomes president, but we gotta keep working and finding out what to do, because the world isn\u2019t going to end,\u201d he adds. \u201cPeople say he\u2019ll push a button and end the world, but there are still great people in this country, so I\u2019m not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater. I still have hope.\u201d One thing that\u2019s reaffirmed Common\u2019s faith in America is the reaction to 13th, which has received heaps of praise following its release on Netflix, and is a frontrunner for the Best Documentary Oscar. \u201cWhen the movie came out, I had friends calling me up to tell me they were spending their weekend watching a documentary on mass incarceration. And it really made me hopeful for the future of this country,\u201d says Common. He then begins to choke up. \u201cAt the New York Film Festival premiere, I was standing on the balcony with Ava and Van Jones, and when the curtain went up it all hit me and I started crying. I felt the pain that a lot of black people have been through in this country and thought, wow man, we are really loving people.\u201d","label":0}
{"text":"Can Comedy Survive President Trump?: Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway\/The Daily Beast Just before midnight on the east coast Tuesday night, Donald Trump finally stopped being hilarious. Judd Apatow summed it up best on Twitter. While there is sometimes a feeling among comedians that comedy can heal all wounds, there was nothing funny about what had just happened in America.  One thing I do not want to watch right now-- comedy about any of this. That's how terrifying and disappointing this is.\u2014 Judd Apatow (@JuddApatow) November 9, 2016  Most of the late-night shows had the luxury of taking election night off, but there was The Daily Show\u2019s shellshocked young host Trevor Noah, live on Comedy Central telling anyone who might have tuned in looking to laugh that they had come to the wrong place. \u201cI genuinely do not understand how America can be this disorganized or this hateful,\u201d he said. The pre-written jokes that followed mostly fell flat. Over on Showtime, Stephen Colbert hosted a live, profanity-filled election night special of his own. But the proceedings lacked the urgently jubilant nature of his election eve show, which featured both Jon Stewart and the lead of Broadway\u2019s Hamilton urging viewers to go out and vote to prevent \u201cthat angry tax- and draft-dodging little orange groundhog\u201d from becoming president. By the end of his hour Tuesday night, the jokes were over and Colbert was reduced to nervously pacing behind his desk and ranting philosophically about the \u201cpoisonous\u201d nature of our politics. As planned, he concluded with a silly bit about the things all Americans should be able to agree on. \u201cYou cannot laugh and be afraid at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the devil cannot stand mockery.\u201d But for many of those on the losing side, it just felt too soon to laugh. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. If there was any upside to Trump defeating Clinton it was that his sheer ridiculousness would be a boon to comedy. Like President Obama, Hillary Clinton has not been the easiest figure to make fun of\u2014though Saturday Night Live\u2019s Kate McKinnon did achieve something magical with an impression that we are unlikely to see any more of after this week. But Trump has been a goldmine for late-night television, from John Oliver\u2019s most-watched-ever #MakeAmericaDrumpfAgain takedown to Seth Meyers\u2019s nightly \u201ccloser looks\u201d at Trump\u2019s horrific behavior to Samantha Bee\u2019s too-convincing conspiracy theory that #TrumpCantRead. In every case, the jokes were funny because we all knew this man would never actually be president\u2026 right? His ultimately doomed quest for legitimacy was also the cornerstone of President Obama\u2019s most searing jokes about Trump, from the 2011 White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner speech that many believe drove him to run to his #phonedrop moment on Jimmy Kimmel Live just a few weeks ago. In response to a \u201cmean tweet\u201d from Trump about Obama being \u201cperhaps the worst president in the history of the United States,\u201d the president replied, \u201cReally? Well, @realDonaldTrump, at least I will go down as a president.\u201d See what I mean? Not so funny anymore. It is also notable that while SNL was one of the only comedy shows that found a way to make Hillary Clinton funny, they never quite managed to do the same with Donald Trump. The type of satire that show trades in works when there is something to heighten, whether it\u2019s Dana Carvey\u2019s manic George H.W. Bush or Will Ferrell\u2019s dimwitted George W. Bush. But over time, as our real-life politicians have moved closer to parody, their job has gotten more difficult. Tina Fey\u2019s Sarah Palin impression was really only funny because of how accurate it was. The same can be said for Alec Baldwin\u2019s Donald Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s the head writer of his own comedy routine,\u201d Baldwin said of Trump on Election Day in his first interview about the SNL portrayal with WNYC\u2019s Brian Lehrer. \u201cWhen we sit down and think about what to say, and the writers write down what to say, Trump is supplying them all the material that they need.\u201d But as we learned after the novelty of Baldwin\u2019s technically accurate impression wore off, there was nothing inherently funny about hearing him elaborate on Trump\u2019s \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d rhetoric. Even Baldwin grew weary of embodying Trump, breaking character in what he thought would be his final appearance as the candidate this past Saturday to apologize to McKinnon for being so awful toward her this whole time. \u201cDon\u2019t you guys just feel gross all the time about this?\u201d he asked. Now, SNL has to decide how to handle President Trump. They got rid of Taran Killam, who briefly played Trump last year before he was replaced by Darrell Hammond, who was in turn cast aside in favor of Baldwin. In his interview with Lehrer, Baldwin said he \u201choped\u201d his run as Trump was over, indicating that if Clinton won, he would be done, but if she lost, he would likely be back for just one more episode. \u201cI want my weekends back so I can go be with my kids,\u201d he said, wearily. Perhaps SNL can just do what they did in September of 2015 and have Donald Trump play Donald Trump from now on. Of course, all of these aforementioned shows, and others that are bound to pop up in opposition to him\u2014looking at you female, Latino, and Muslim comedians\u2014will find a way to make Trump funny again. But will a man who has praised authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin tolerate being the target of satire? Trump once sued Bill Maher for joking that his father was a orangutan. Four months ago, Trevor Noah told me that if Trump were to become president the future of The Daily Show could be in jeopardy. \u201cI mean, this is the same man who says he wants to open up the libel laws,\u201d he said, \u201cchange them so that people like you and me can be sued if he feels that what we\u2019re saying about him is damaging\u2014even if it\u2019s based in fact.\u201d The night before the election, Samantha Bee aired the second part of her series from Moscow, which highlighted the parallels between Trump and Putin, who has all but eliminated satire from Russia. \u201cThe only worse thing for a dictator than being criticized, is being laughed at,\u201d one pro-democracy Russian journalist told her. \u201cBut that could never happen here,\u201d Bee said, optimistically, before revealing Trump\u2019s calls for SNL to be canceled after he took issue with Baldwin\u2019s harsh portrayal of him. Let me preface this next statement by saying that I do not equate the election of Donald Trump to the highest office in the land with the killing of thousands of innocent Americans. But there was something about the way we started to see late-night hosts grapple with President-elect Trump\u2014and will see several more do so tonight\u2014that was reminiscent of those first few comedy shows after the 9\/11 attacks. Something has happened in this country that doesn\u2019t feel remotely funny and yet there are comedians who are tasked with going on television and trying to navigate their way through the abyss. Don\u2019t be surprised if the late-night shows are at a loss for comedy once again tonight. On September 20th, 2001, Jon Stewart sat behind his desk at The Daily Show and choked back tears as he said, \u201cThis show in general, we feel like is a privilege. Just even the idea that we can sit in the back of the country and make wise cracks, which is really what we do. We sit in the back and we throw spitballs, but never forgetting the fact that it is a luxury in this country that allows us to do that. A country that allows for open satire, and I know that sounds basic and it sounds as though it goes without saying\u2014but that\u2019s really what this whole situation is about.\u201d We can only hope at this point that America\u2019s new president will come to see it the same way.","label":1}

{"text":"LeBron James Delivers Powerful -- And Needed -- Response To Hate Crime: LeBron James One day before Game 1 of the NBA Finals, LeBron James' Los Angeles house was vandalized with racial slurs. James did not open his Wednesday afternoon press conference with a statement about his house. But when asked about it, he had a response that was heartfelt, thoughtful and measured -- which is exactly what we've come to expect from him. \"If this is to shed a light and continue to keep the conversation going on my behalf, then I'm OK with it,\" James opened in Oakland. James has been a big part of that conversation himself the past few years as one of the most prominent athletes to take political stands. When Trayvon Martin was shot, James were a black hoodie during warmups. When Eric Garner was killed, James wore an \"I CAN'T BREATHE\" T-shirt. As police shootings and the 2016 presidential campaign brought aspects of racism to the forefront, James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade and Chris Paul spoke on race and violence at the ESPYs. James wrote a column to articulate his endorsement of Hillary Clinton for president. \"It just goes to show that racism will always be a part of the world, a part of America,\" James continued. \"And hate in America, especially for African Americans, is living every day. And even though that it's concealed most of the time, even though people hide their faces and will say things about you, and when they see you, they smile in your face, it's a life every single day. \"And I think back to Emmett Till's mom, actually. It's kind of one of the first things I thought of, and the reason that she had an open casket is because she wanted to show the world what her son went through as far as a hate crime and being black in America. \"So it's like it doesn't -- no matter how much money you have, no matter how famous you are, no matter how many people admire you, being black in America is -- it's tough. And we got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans, until we feel equal in America. But my family is safe, and that's what's important.\"  LeBron James shares thoughts on his Los Angeles house getting vandalized. pic.twitter.com\/4RFLK42xhu  LeBron James is not Muhammad Ali. He is not traveling the world fighting injustices in impoverished nations. He is not Colin Kaepernick, staging a protest before every game. But when he speaks about important issues, his words have impact -- and it's not just because he's a celebrity. He educates himself and has substantial opinions. He is cognizant of his voice and is mindful of when to use it. Last fall, a reporter asked James about Kaepernick's national anthem protests. James said he would not kneel, but recognized the need for Kaepernick to have that freedom. He then transitioned the conversation to a personal thought James had been having -- an example other black parents could relate to. \"You have the right to voice your opinion, stand for your opinion, and he's doing it in the most peaceful way I've ever seen someone do something,\" James said then. \"For me, my personal feelings is that I got a 12-year-old son, a 9-year-old son and a 2-year-old daughter, and I look at my son being four years removed from driving his own car and being able to leave the house on his own, and it's a scary thought right now to think if my son gets pulled over. You tell your kids if you just apply [the lessons you teach them] and if you just listen to the police that they will be respectful and it will work itself out. And you see these videos that continue to come out, and it's a scary-ass situation that if my son calls me and says that he's been pulled over that I'm not that confident that things are going to go well and my son is going to return home. And my son just started the sixth grade.\" James has his haters -- from both sides. There are people who feel that he's just an athlete who should stick to sports. Then there are people who think James does not do enough with his mega-reach to create legitimate progress. If you're among those who wished James would have gone even deeper into this subject Wednesday, consider that basketball is still his priority, particularly this week when he needs to focus on figuring out how to guard Kevin Durant. But James made it clear again Wednesday that if he can be this engaged in political dialogue while he's still playing in the NBA, we can only expect even more once he's retired.

{"text":"Rep. Steve King Might Be a Racist, and This Tweet Proves It: Rep. Steve King (@TPM via Twitter screenshot) On Thursday I wrote about Roy Moore waxing nostalgic about the days of slavery. And every day, The Root covers something crazy that the current sitting president has said. This current regime is not attempting to hide its racist overtones, and this latest incident is no exception: A Republican congressman from Iowa tweeted from his verified account Friday that \u201cdiversity is not our strength.\u201d I\u2019m not making this up. Let me give you some background on Iowa Rep. Steve King. He is the person who sponsored the Heartbeat Protection Act of 2017, an amendment to the federal criminal code that makes it a crime for any physician \u201cto knowingly perform an abortion: (1) without determining whether the fetus has a detectable heartbeat, (2) without informing the woman of the results, or (3) after determining that a fetus has a detectable heartbeat.\u201d Clearly, King doesn\u2019t believe in women being in charge of their own vaginas, and if his tweet is any indication, he doesn\u2019t want them sharing their vaginas outside of their race, either. \u201cDiversity is not our strength. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, \u2018Mixing cultures will not lead to a higher quality of life but a lower one,\u2019\u201d King wrote, linking to an article referencing the Orban quote. If you are unfamiliar with Orb\u00e1n, Politico describes him as a \u201cconservative subversive.\u201d He is anti-immigrant and has installed razor wire fencing and water cannons at his borders. If King thinks that Orb\u00e1n is an example to follow, that tells us everything we need to know about him, even if his latest tweets didn\u2019t already. King followed up the diversity tweet by writing, \u201cAssimilation has become a dirty word to the multiculturalist left. Assimilation, not diversity, is our American strength.\u201d Of course, the people of Twitter had strong reactions to King\u2019s statements, as well they should. We should be very afraid that this is what we have in our so-called representative government, which is purportedly built \u201cof the people, by the people.\u201d","label":1}

{"text":"Which Presidents Were Left-Handed?: James Garfield, Twentieth President of the United States. Credit: Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division, LC-BH82601-1484-B DLC There have been eight left-handed presidents that we know of. However, this number is not necessarily accurate because in the past left-handedness was actively discouraged. Many individuals who would have grown up left-handed were in fact forced to learn how to write with their right hand. And, if recent history is any indication, left-handedness seems to be far more common among U.S. presidents than it is among the general population. Naturally, this apparent phenomenon has led to many speculations. James Garfield (March-September 1881) is considered by many to be the first president who was left-handed. Anecdotes indicate that he was ambidextrous and could write with both hands at the same time. However, he served only six months before succumbing to gunshot wounds after Charles Guiteau shot him in July of his first term. What is perhaps most noteworthy about left-handed presidents is how many there have been in recent decades. Of the last 15 presidents, seven (about 47%) have been left-handed. That might not mean much until you consider that the global percentage of left-handed people is about 10%. So among the general population, only 1 in 10 people are left-handed, while in the modern-era White House, almost 1 in 2 have been left-handed. And there's every reason to believe that this trend will continue because it's no longer standard practice to steer children away from natural left-handedness. A quick count of political parties in the list above shows the Republicans slightly ahead of the Democrats, with five of the eight lefties being Republican. If the numbers were reversed, perhaps someone would argue that left-handed people are more in line with left politics. After all, many people believe that left-handedness seems to correspond to creative, or at least \"out of the box\" thinking, pointing to famous lefty artist such as Pablo Picasso, Jimi Hendrix and Leonardo Di Vinci. While this theory obviously wouldn't be supported by the history of left-handed presidents, the unusually high percentage of lefties in the White House may point to other characteristics that may give lefties an edge in leadership roles (or at least at winning elections): Language development: According to scientists Sam Wang and Sandra Aamodt, authors of Welcome to Your Brain, 1 in 7 left-handed people use both hemispheres (left and right) of their brain to process language, while almost all right-handed people process language on only the left side of the brain (the left side controls the right hand, and vice versa). It's possible that this \"ambidextrous\" language processing gives lefties an advantage as orators. Creative thinking: Studies have shown a correlation between left-handedness and creative thinking, or more specifically, divergent thinking, or an aptitude for developing multiple solutions to problems. Chris McManus, author of Right-Hand, Left-Hand, suggests that left-handedness may be associated with a more highly developed right hemisphere of the brain, the side that's better at creative thinking. This may also explain the over representation of left-handed artists. So, if you're a lefty who gets annoyed with all the right-handed bias in the world, perhaps you can help change things as our next president.","label":0}
{"text":"Bauxite man arrested after allegedly shooting man, towards first responders: BENTON, Ark. (KTHV) - On Sunday, the Benton Police Department arrested a Bauxite man that allegedly shot a man and then shot at first responders. Around midnight, a Benton police officer heard two loud bangs within a minute of each other in downtown Benton. The officer then noticed a vehicle driving fast and promptly pulled the car over. When questioned, the driver revealed he was suffering from a gunshot wound in his left thigh. He then told officers that 45-year-old Gregory Overton shot him near the 300 block of South Main Street. As Benton Fire Rescue personnel were tending to the victim's injuries, shots were fired in their direction. One of the shots was heard hitting vegetation \"directly behind\" the officers on scene. The SWAT team was called out to the scene and Overton was arrested shortly after their arrival. Police recovered a gun they believe was the one used by Overton. He faces charges of first degree battery, a terroristic act, aggravated assault, criminal mischief, discharge of a firearm within city limits, and tampering with physical evidence. The investigation is ongoing and Benton police expect more charges to be filed.","label":0}

{"text":"BOOM! Wikileaks Confirms Hillary Sold Weapons To ISIS.: Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is a controversial character. But there\u2019s no denying the emails he has picked up from inside the Democrat Party are real, and he\u2019s willing to expose Hillary Clinton.Now, he\u2019s announcing that Hillary Clinton and her State Department were actively arming Islamic jihadists, which includes the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria. Clinton has repeatedly denied these claims, including during multiple statements while under oath in front of the United States Senate. WikiLeaks is about to prove Hillary Clinton deserves to be arrested:  The Reagan administration officials hoped to secure the release of several U.S. hostages, and then take proceeds from the arms sales to Iran, to fund the Contras in Nicaragua. In Obama\u2019s second term, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton authorized the shipment of American-made arms to Qatar, a country beholden to the Muslim Brotherhood, and friendly to the Libyan rebels, in an effort to topple the Libyan\/Gaddafi government, and then ship those arms to Syria in order to fund Al Qaeda, and topple Assad in Syria. Clinton took the lead role in organizing the so-called \u201cFriends of Syria\u201d (aka Al Qaeda\/ISIS) to back the CIA-led insurgency for regime change in Syria. Under oath Hillary Clinton denied she knew about the weapons shipments during public testimony in early 2013 after the Benghazi terrorist attack. In an interview with Democracy Now, Wikileaks\u2019 Julian Assange is now stating that 1,700 emails contained in the Clinton cache directly connect Hillary to Libya to Syria, and directly to Al Qaeda and ISIS.  Here is the incredible transcript:  JUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: Julian, I want to mention something else. In March, you launched a searchable archive for over 30,000 emails and email attachments sent to and from Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server while she was secretary of state. The 50,547 pages of documents span the time from June 2010 to August 2014; 7,500 of the documents were sent by Hillary Clinton herself. The emails were made available in the form of thousands of PDFs by the U.S. State Department as the result of a Freedom of Information Act request. Why did you do this, and what\u2019s the importance, from your perspective, of being able to create a searchable base? JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, WikiLeaks has become the rebel library of Alexandria. It is the single most significant collection of information that doesn\u2019t exist elsewhere, in a searchable, accessible, citable form, about how modern institutions actually behave. And it\u2019s gone on to set people free from prison, where documents have been used in their court cases; hold the CIA accountable for renditions programs; feed into election cycles, which have resulted in the termination of, in some case\u2014or contributed to the termination of governments, in some cases, taken the heads of intelligence agencies, ministers of defense and so on. So, you know, our civilizations can only be as good as our knowledge of what our civilisation is. We can\u2019t possibly hope to reform that which we do not understand. So, those Hillary Clinton emails, they connect together with the cables that we have published of Hillary Clinton, creating a rich picture of how Hillary Clinton performs in office, but, more broadly, how the U.S. Department of State operates. So, for example, the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including ISIS, that\u2019s there in those emails. There\u2019s more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton\u2019s collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone.  It appears that Hillary Clinton committed perjury, just like her husband was caught doing as President.","label":1}
{"text":"CNN Commentator: White People Don\u2019t Get to Complain About Black Protests: Symone Sanders, a Democratic strategist and political commentator for CNN, ripped into conservative Ben Ferguson, also a CNN commentator, for daring to complain about the NFL kneeling protests, saying white people have no right telling black people what to do. Sanders forgets that we live in a free country where criticisms aren\u2019t limited to people with certain skin tones, but she can\u2019t see past her own racist anger to follow a logical train of thought. She has a huge problem with folks like Ferguson, or Donald Trump, telling NFL players they should stand for the national anthem. Ferguson made the case that our national leaders should not attend a football game where players are disrespecting the country they took an oath to defend. He likens kneeling against the flag as \u201cbasically giving the middle finger to the men and women who have fought to protect this country.\u201d Therefore, a president should be able to speak out against such actions. CNN anchor Fredricka Whitfield also made her disagreement with Ferguson known and attempted to correct him for having an opinion.

Whitfield laughed and agreed, \u201cYeah, nobody\u2019s done that,\u201d referring to the middle finger comment.

{"text":"Police union hires Chicago cop who shot Laquan McDonald to work as janitor: Corrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this story misstated the status of Jason Van Dyke\u2019s court proceedings. CHICAGO \u2014 The city's police union has hired the cop facing first-degree murder charges in the fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald to work as a janitor. Jason Van Dyke, who was charged in November for the incident that set off weeks of protests in the city, will be paid $12 per hour. News of the hiring by the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police, which was first reported by WFLD-TV in Chicago, has spurred outrage from activists in the city. The Rev. Michael Pfleger, a Catholic priest and prominent activist on the city's South Side, called the move by the union \"a disgrace\" and a setback for efforts to restore fraught relations between the police department and the African-American community. \"The Police Union says to Chicago ... we don't give a damn what he did, what you think, he is one of ours, and we are going to take care of him,\" Pfleger wrote on his Facebook page. The union has shown support for Van Dyke since he was charged on the same day the city was forced by court order to release chilling dashcam video that showed Van Dyke, who is white, fire 16 shots at the black teen. Van Dyke was charged 400 days after the incident. Van Dyke opened fire within seconds of arriving on the scene, saying that he feared for his life. At least five police officers at the scene backed up Van Dyke in official police statements following the shooting, according to investigative documents released by the city. Van Dyke told investigators that McDonald was moving toward him when he started firing. The dashcam video, however, appears to show McDonald moving away from Van Dyke when the officer opened fire. Van Dyke was suspended without pay after he was charged. The officer's attorney, Dan Herbert, had previously said that Van Dyke was having trouble finding work in the aftermath of the incident. Van Dyke, who has pleaded not guilty, remains free on bail as he awaits trial. Van Dyke began working nights at the FOP headquarters about three weeks ago. Dean Angelo Sr., the union president, defended the hiring. \u201cWe do this for our membership and this is what the FOP stands for, fraternalism,\" Angelo told WFLD. \"This officer is in a very difficult situation financially; he has a family and we would do it for anybody that works as a Chicago Police officer.\" Follow USA TODAY Chicago correspondent Aamer Madhani on Twitter: @AamerISmad","label":0}
{"text":"Obama won't criticize FBI director over Clinton email investigation: Press Secretary Josh Earnest stated that President Obama does not believe FBI Director James Comey was trying to impact the election by announcing the FBI will reopen Hillary Clinton's email investigation. USA TODAY NETWORK WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House professed its neutrality Monday in the growing debate over FBI Director James Comey's decision to notify Congress that he had resumed the agency's investigation into former secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails. \"I\u2019ll neither defend nor criticize what Director Comey has decided to communicate to the public about his decision,\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters after speaking to Obama about the issue. He described Obama as \"pretty even-keeled\" about the news, even in the midst of his aggressive campaign schedule on Clinton's behalf. Earnest's statement came amid growing criticism of Comey's handling of the investigation, both from Democrats and even some Republicans. \"Director Comey is a man of integrity, he's a man of principle, and he's a man of good character,\" Earnest said. \"He's in a tough spot. And he's the one who will be in a position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism.\" The FBI does not usually notify Congress about pending investigations. But in a letter to congressional committees Friday, Comey said he felt obliged to do so because he had previously testified that the investigation had been completed. Justice Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said the FBI discovered Clinton emails on a computer co-owned by Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her now-estranged husband, former congressman Anthony Weiner. The FBI is investigating Weiner's communications with an underage girl. The Democratic presidential nominee's emails have been a campaign issue since The New York Times reported that she used a private email server to send and receive official emails, many of which turned out to be classified. In between the lines of Earnest's non-criticism of Comey, however, were suggestions that the White House isn't entirely happy with how Comey has handled the emails. Comey's July news conference contained \"some rather harsh condemnations\" of Clinton, and much of his subsequent congressional testimony \"provided fodder to Secretary Clinton's critics,\" Earnest said. He said Obama believes the FBI director's substantial authority to conduct investigations should be \"tempered by an adherence to longstanding tradition and practice and norms that limit public discussion of facts that are collected in the context of those investigations.\" But Earnest also said President Obama does not believe that Comey intended to influence the election, or that he was \"secretly strategizing\" to benefit Clinton's opponent, Donald Trump. That would suggest that Obama does not believe Comey violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from using their office to intentionally influence an election, and which would give Obama grounds to remove Comey from office.

Since the Democratic convention, where her speech on the first night was widely regarded as perhaps the highlight of the four-day gathering, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of Hillary Clinton's top surrogates, as she's cast Clinton's GOP opponent, Donald Trump, as unfit to be a moral leader for the nation. At a campaign event Thursday, the first lady again took on the Republican presidential nominee, reacting to his latest, perhaps most explosive controversy yet: the recently released 2005 recording in which he's heard graphically discussing groping women, which was followed this week by accusations from multiple women that he'd made unwanted sexual advances toward them, which he has denied. \"Last week, we saw this candidate actually bragging about sexually assaulting women,\" the first lady said in Manchester, N.H., \"and I can't believe that I'm saying that a candidate for president of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women.\" She continued: \"I can't stop thinking about this. It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted.\" The first lady said it would be \"dishonest\" and \"disingenuous\" for her \"to just move on to the next thing like this was all just a bad dream.\" \"It's not something we can just sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election season,\" she added of the Trump recording. She also seemed to allude to reports that surfaced Wednesday night in The New York Times and elsewhere of women accusing Trump of sexual misconduct in years past, saying that \"it now seems very clear\" the recording released last Friday wasn't \"an isolated incident.\" \"I listen to all of this, and I feel it so personally,\" she said, adding that women, in particular, likely felt the same way. \"The shameful comments about our bodies, the disrespect of our ambitions and intellect, the belief that you can do anything you want to a woman \u2014 it is cruel, it's frightening, and the truth is, it hurts,\" she said of Trump's comments. Following her remarks at the Democratic convention, the percentage of Americans who said they viewed the first lady favorably rose to 64%, according to a Gallup survey, a figure that makes her far more popular than either of the presidential nominees. During that speech, Obama, without naming him, asserted that Trump was unfit to fulfill the role of national role model. \"This election, and every election, is about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four or eight years of their lives,\" the first lady said. \"And I am here tonight because in this election, there is only one person who I trust with that responsibility, only one person who I believe is truly qualified to be president of the United States, and that is our friend, Hillary Clinton.\" Obama revisited that theme Thursday in New Hampshire, laying out what she said were the stakes for the nation's children. \u201cIn our hearts, we all know that if we let Hillary\u2019s opponent win in this election, that we are sending a clear message to our kids: that everything they\u2019re seeing and hearing is perfectly OK,\" she said. \"We're telling our sons that it's OK to humiliate women,\" the first lady said. \"We're telling our daughters that this is how they deserve to be treated. We're telling all our kids that bigotry and bullying are perfectly acceptable in the leader of their country.\" She added: \"If we have a president who routinely degrades women, who brags about sexually assaulting women, then how can we maintain our moral authority in the world?\" Watch her speech below (beginning just after the 25-minute mark):","label":1}
{"text":"Paris attack heightens European tensions with Muslims: Another police officer in Paris was killed in a shooting Thursday morning as a manhunt for two of the gunmen suspected in an attack on French satirical magazine 'Charlie Hebdo' continued. VPC Corrections and clarifications: An earlier version of this story misstated German Chancellor Angela Merkel's first name. The terrorist attack on the satirical weekly in Paris threatens to create deeper animosities between Europe's growing Muslim minority and a native population that is increasingly embracing anti-Islam and anti-immigration movements. \"The radicals are trying to exacerbate tensions that are already there,\" said Jonathan Laurence, author of Integrating Islam: Political and Religious Challenges in Contemporary France. \"They're trying to drive a wedge between Muslims and the West.\" From France and Germany to Sweden and the United Kingdom, a backlash is spreading against Muslim immigrants, including tens of thousands of recent refugees from Syria's long civil war. In France, which has Western Europe's largest Muslim community, the anti-immigration National Front Party won 25% of the vote in the most recent elections in May, and radical anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim protests have taken place in multiple German cities in recent days. Until now, those and similar movements in other Western European countries have focused on limiting immigration and protecting the rights of publications to criticize Islam. They also have tried to halt what they view as excessive accommodations to Muslim culture: the use of Arabic language, headscarves worn by women, establishment of mosques, and serving halal food in school cafeterias. Wednesday's attack will provide a security element to those arguments, said Laurence, who teaches political science at Boston College. It \"ties a foreign threat of violence in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan and Libya and brings it home and raises the conflict temperature to a dangerous levels within Europe,\" he said. Nile Gardiner, director of the Margaret Thatcher Center on Freedom at the conservative Heritage Foundation, also predicted greater cultural conflicts in Europe. \"It's inevitable there are going to be greater tensions now in France,\" Gardiner said. \"These attacks will elevate the issue of homegrown jihadists to the top of the political agenda.\" A similar discourse will take place all over Europe, as it has already in the United Kingdom, Gardiner said. \"There's a massive homegrown terrorist threat in the U.K. It's also an issue in Belgium, Holland, Germany and across Western Europe,\" he said. \"This attack will up the stakes.\" French and other European officials have warned of heightened terrorist threats from citizens who identify with radical Islamist groups in North Africa and the Middle East, while political and populist leaders have railed against their countries' immigration policies, which they've characterized as lax and threatening to European culture. The attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine, which poked fun at Muslim, Catholic and Orthodox Jewish clerics, fits into a pattern of radical Muslim reprisals against European critics in the world of culture. In 1989, Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa (legal decree) calling for the death of author Salman Rushdie over his allegedly blasphemous portrayal of Islam's prophet Mohammed. Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh was murdered in 2004 for his film, Submission, about the treatment of women in Islam. And Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard escaped an assassination attempt in 2010 for his 2005 cartoon portrayal of the prophet, which caused riots and protests across the Muslim world. Thousands of Germans took part this week in anti-immigration rallies in Dresden, Berlin and Cologne, organized by a group known as PEGIDA, a German acronym for Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West. Germany's political establishment, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, denounced the rallies as undemocratic and hateful. The group was started by PEGIDA leader Lutz Bachmann in October to protest plans to add 14 centers for about 2,000 refugees in Dresden. Demonstrators reject charges they are far-right extremists or neo-Nazis. They say they are concerned by an influx of 200,000 refugees in 2014, many from war-torn Syria. Similar sentiments have been expressed in Sweden by members of the far-right, anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats Party, which centrist parties sought to isolate and weaken last month by forming a broad parliamentary coalition. In France, the National Front Party headed by Marine Le Pen has gained support among working-class voters who believe the mainstream politicians have failed to address their concerns about crime, immigration and jobs. \"There's a growing sense across France that immigration laws have been too weak,\" Gardiner said. He predicted that French officials would crack down on preachers of hate in radical mosques in Paris and other large French cities, and on French citizens seeking to fight with radical Islamist groups in Iraq or Syria. Whether that means far-right groups gain support depends on French President Francois Hollande's response, Gardiner said. France has been at the forefront of European nations in the fight against Islamist extremists in the Middle East and North Africa, focusing on its former 20th-century colonies. Hollande sent 3,000 troops to Mali to battle Islamist extremists who'd taken over a large swath of that former colony. He also joined the U.S.-led coalition launching airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria. And on Monday, Hollande said he would strike at Islamist militants in Libya who try to cross or send weapons into neighboring Niger, where France has a base. France's domestic immigration issues also stem from its colonial past, including a civil war for independence from French control in Algeria that led to a flood of refugees into France in the early 1960s. \"France has this colonial legacy to deal with when negotiating the integration of the millions of descendants of these colonial subjects,\" author Laurence said. \"It's a political problem. What the violence does is prevent a political solution because it tends to polarize and make it appear the problem is not resolvable politically and can only be resolved militarily.\"","label":0}
{"text":"Trump\u2019s Speech: Dog Whistles to the Sovereign-Citizen Set: Trump\u2019s Thursday speech marked a turning point. There is now no scenario in which this country repudiates him and merely goes about its business. It\u2019s easy to forget how silly most people thought Donald Trump was, all the way back in January. It was before any primaries or caucuses. Trump led in most polls, but people still couldn\u2019t really quite believe that people were actually going to vote for him. I spent much of that month at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, reporting for The Daily Beast on the militants who had taken it over. In the intervening months, Trump has morphed from a vague joke or a thumb in the eye of the establishment, depending on your point of view, to a fascist megalomaniacal wreck of a candidate who is unlikely to be elected because he is fundamentally incapable of seeing past his own nose. As Trump has become an ever-more-worrisome figure, you can track his descent into right-wing madness easily. There were the Red Meat days, where he was merely a bigot. Then came the alt-right phase, the joyous celebration of Daddy Trump and Pepe the Frog and the oven jokes on Twitter. Trump has by now lied so often and so blatantly that many people thought it a little joke when we found out he\u2019d bragged about sexually assaulting women. Of course he did, he\u2019s Donald Trump. But for once the man was telling the truth, and in the last day or so America has watched with dawning horror as we realize that if he wasn\u2019t lying about being a sex criminal, perhaps he has not been lying about the walls and the deportations and the locking up of his political opponents. Maybe he\u2019s actually been telling the truth about himself this whole time. I watched his speech Thursday, and if I closed my eyes, I could smell the campfire smoke at the Malheur refuge and feel the Oregon winter wind on my face. Here were the conspiracies, the references to the shadowy international cabals, the whispers about the illegitimacy of the Department of Justice and the Trilateralist coopting of the FBI. It was like listening to an immodest Ammon Bundy. We have to protect ourselves from not just the government (because it is only a pawn) but from the people who really run it. We should be watchful, resilient, ready\u2014and though he is reluctant, he will sacrifice himself, for he is the only one who can save us from the terror. Donald Trump shouted out every fevered dystopian fantasy I heard on the refuge, with the exceptions of Agenda 21 and abortion as population control. \u201cThey control the Department of Justice,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have essentially corrupted the director of the FBI.\u201d \u201cThis is a conspiracy against you, the American people, and we cannot let this happen or continue. This is our moment of reckoning.\u201d This is precisely the logic that led a few hundred people to take up arms against the government in Oregon, though at least Ammon Bundy started with a reasonably legitimate premise. Donald Trump doesn\u2019t even have two Americans jailed twice for the same crime to legitimize his quest. What he has is a small but growing fringe that talks about We the People instead of Americans. We have already seen the violence at his rallies, we have seen the vicious street attacks, we have worried about the rise of the right. What I have not until Thursday heard was something that spiked my nativist upbringing, words delivered in a very particular order that made me want to go buy another rifle and check my food storage. I was raised among white people, sent to an elementary school in which there were no black kids, and then moved to the mountains of Utah for high school, where the neo-Nazis recruited at illicit drinking parties because kids who would have a beer were already disaffected in an overwhelmingly Mormon culture. There is a part of me that remembers the coding, the tones, remembers the fear that the government might come and massacre us again as they had in times not that long ago. I reject it violently, but you don\u2019t ever forget what you were raised to believe even if you learn better. It would take a linguist to comb through that speech and parse out which words came from where. I am only a writer steeped in the language of right-wing revolution. I was outraged by Trump before. But now I am worried. There is no scenario in which this country repudiates him and then goes about its business; we allowed his rise and we have emboldened the people that we ignored for so long. We have three weeks to go yet, more scandals and reactions and fear and terror, and at the end of it, we will have an unknowable number of people who will absolutely and without question think that Hillary Clinton\u2019s election is an unmistakable sign that it is time for the governed to withdraw their consent. Not a majority; not even many, compared to the millions of people who live in America. But enough. Thursday, Donald Trump traveled a step further down the path of militant right-wing revolution. It wasn\u2019t a call to arms, exactly. But it was far past the point of comfort.","label":1}

Danny Tarkanian is taking yet another shot at political office and this time he's announced that he will be challenging Dean Heller in the Republican primary with hopes of getting elected to the United States Senate. Danny Tarkanian, son of famed UNLV men's basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, has unsuccessful run for office five times. He's hoping the sixth time is the charm. Tarkanian posted the following statement on his website: \u201cOver the past several weeks, I have been inundated with text, emails, and phone calls from people of all walks of life across the state of Nevada who are upset with Dean Heller for campaigning one way in Nevada and voting the exact opposite in Washington DC. The refrain is the same: he turned his back on us. Today, after much thought and discussion with my family and friends, I have decided to run for the United States Senate. I am running for United States Senate because Nevada deserves a Senator who will keep his word and vote in Washington DC the same way he campaigns here in Nevada. I am a conservative Republican who supports the policies of President Trump to repeal Obamacare and end illegal immigration. I will continue to support President Trump's policies that have led to a 20% increase in the stock market in just six months. I will join Senator Lee, Senator Cruz, and Senator Paul fighting for real reforms against the liberals in our party. I look forward to campaigning across the state of Nevada and earning your support. It is time to take a stand. Together, we will make our state, and our country, proud.\u201d With rumors of Republican's growing upset with Heller's opposition to President Trump's policies, it comes as no surprise that Tarkanian will placate towards the disgruntled sector of the party. Time will tell if this platform will be enough to give Tarkanian that elusive political victory. Copyright 2017 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

{"text":"Justice Dept to offer Hillary a PLEA bargain \u2014 there\u2019s just ONE catch: Liberals tried their hardest to distract America from the crimes Hillary Clinton committed, but it looks like they lost that too. America chose not to vote for Hillary Clinton after leaked emails revealed her as a threat to national security. Democrats work long hours trying to play it off as a simple mistake even though Clinton was well aware of how to handle classified information. Naturally, their next defense was to attack the President in a lame attempt for impeachment by falsifying reports of Russian collusion in the hopes that this tactic would distract the public from the real issue. Hillary Clinton knowingly endangered the safety of America by flouting her top security clearance in thousands of emails where she disclosed information on an open email server that she should have never had in the first place. Although two investigations were opened by the FBI in regards to this crime nothing came from either one. Now, it\u2019s time for a third investigation to be conducted by the DOJ and things aren\u2019t looking good for Clinton this time around. According to reports, the Justice Department reopened the investigation into Clinton\u2019s homebrewed email server. Suddenly, it appears Clinton may not be in the clear after all. From the Daily Wire: \u201cThe Justice Department has reopened the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s mishandling of classified material on her private email system while she was secretary of state, and is considering offering her a plea bargain if she will agree to plead guilty to charges of breaking the law, according to a Clinton attorney,\u201d The discussion of a plea bargain took place late last month and was offered by a high-ranking Justice Department official to the Clinton lawyer. During the exploratory talks with the prosecutor, the Clinton attorney was told that despite former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s decision last July not to prosecute Hillary, the Justice Department has reexamined the email case and believes there are ample grounds for prosecuting Hillary on a number of counts. As part of the plea, Clinton would be forced to admit guilt: Under the Justice Department\u2019s plea offer, Hillary would be required to sign a document admitting that she committed a prosecutable crime. In return, the DOJ would agree not to bring charges against Hillary in connection with the email probe. Also as part of the agreement, the Justice Department would not proceed with an investigation of Hillary\u2019s pay to play deals with foreign governments and businessmen who contributed to the Clinton Foundation or who paid Bill Clinton exorbitant speaking fees. Well, it\u2019s little more than a slap on the hand but at least it requires an admission of guilt.","label":1}

Chief Jeff O'Dell identified the two killed as Sgt. Richard \"Sam\" Howard and Officer Matthew Baxter. Both of them were fathers. Florida Gov. Rick Scott said he was \"heartbroken.\" President Donald Trump tweeted a message to the Kissimmee Police Department early Saturday morning. \"My thoughts and prayers are with the Kissimmee Police and their loved ones,\" Trump said. \"We are with you.\" Howard and Baxter, who were both wearing their uniforms, were shot about 9:30 p.m. in a neighborhood known for having drug activity, O'Dell said. Both officers were taken to Osceola Regional Hospital where doctors pronounced Baxter dead Friday night and Howard dead Saturday. Everett Miller is accused of shooting at police officers Friday night in Kissimmee. Four suspects were in custody early Saturday morning, O'Dell said. Detectives arrested Everett Glenn Miller, a 45-year-old military veteran with a history of mental health issues, at the Roscoe's Bar at 2344 N. Orange Blossom Trail. Police officers said he was in possession of a 9 mm and a .22 revolver. O'Dell said officers used Baxter's handcuffs to take Miller to the Osceola County Jail. Prosecutors charged Miller with first-degree murder, resisting arrest without violence and carrying a weapon to an establishment licensed to dispense alcoholic beverages, records show. \"I am so proud of the sworn and civilian members of our department by acting quickly to identify the suspect and bring him to justice,\" O'Dell said. \"We will mourn over the next few days.\" Osceola County Commissioner Fred Hawkins Jr. said the last Kissimmee police officer who was killed on duty was in 1983. \"Heartbreaking loss of two of Kissimmee's finest officers,\" Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs tweeted. \"Please join in prayers for families, friends and law enforcement.\" Police officers and deputies from St. Cloud, Orlando, Orange County and Florida Highway Patrol troopers were assisting the Kissimmee Police Department.

An attorney for the Liberty Counsel told Local 10 news that the Liberty Counsel is not a hate group. \"We hate no one, and love all people. All people have inherent dignity and deserve respect because they are created by God in His image,\" Richard Mast said in an email. President Donald Trump, facing mounting pressure from Republicans and Democrats alike, did what he declined to do over the weekend during an event at the White House on Monday when he directly condemned white supremacists and neo-Nazis in a brief statement to reporters. \"Racism is evil -- and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,\" Trump said in response to the attacks in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. \"Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America,\" Trump said. The comments came in a hastily scheduled White House event in the Diplomatic Reception Room, where Trump -- speaking with the help of a teleprompter -- spoke straight to camera after meeting with FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to discuss the Department of Justice's civil rights investigation into the attack. \"To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend's racist violence, you will be held fully accountable,\" he said. \"Justice will be delivered. \" Trump had been excoriated for his unwillingness to condemn the groups behind the violent protests that left one woman dead who was hit by a car allegedly driven by a man with ties to white supremacy groups.

'White Lives Matter' rally canceled by Texas A ;M officials due to safety concerns President Donald Trump, facing mounting pressure from Republicans and Democrats alike, did what he declined to do over the weekend during an event at the White House on Monday when he directly condemned white supremacists and neo-Nazis in a brief statement to reporters.  \"Racism is evil -- and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,\" Trump said in response to the attacks in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend.  \"Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America,\" Trump said. The comments came in a hastily scheduled White House event in the Diplomatic Reception Room, where Trump -- speaking with the help of a teleprompter -- spoke straight to camera after meeting with FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to discuss the Department of Justice's civil rights investigation into the attack. \"To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend's racist violence, you will be held fully accountable,\" he said. \"Justice will be delivered. \" Trump had been excoriated for his unwillingness to condemn the groups behind the violent protests that left one woman dead who was hit by a car allegedly driven by a man with ties to white supremacy groups. After blaming the violence \"on many sides\" Saturday, Trump stayed silent for close to 48 hours, letting his trademark bluntness and campaign pledges to call terrorism what it is, succumb to silence and vagueness.

{"text":"Fox News\u2019 Eboni Williams Tears Into David Clarke For Calling John Lewis \u2018John Who?\u2019: Prior to President Donald Trump\u2019s visitto the opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum today, Fox  ; Friends brought on Trump supporter and former sheriff David Clarke to discuss the president\u2019s appearance. And things got very tense very fast. Right off the bat, co-host Pete Hegseth asked Clarke what he thought about Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), a civil rights icon, deciding not to attend the opening because Trump would be in attendance. Clarke reacted by immediately dismissing Lewis. \u201cJohn who?\u201d Clarke mocking stated. \u201cJohn Lewis \u2014 he was bloodied on the Selma bridge, Sheriff, when trying to protest voting rights and a variety of other things,\u201d guest host Eboni Williams said in response. Clarke shot back that he knew who Lewis was and that he had become one of the \u201cmost irrelevant members of Congress,\u201d adding that Lewis has been \u201creduced to being a caricature\u201d before praising Trump for realizing that \u201cactions speak louder than words.\u201d \u201cSheriff let me say this to you,\u201d Williams said. \u201cFor you to say that nobody cares about John Lewis is inaccurate because I assure you that there are many people across this country that absolutely do care about him.\u201d She added, \u201cAs for your commentary on his political record as a congressman, I\u2019m actually not even addressing that part because this museum opening is about the civil rights of American citizens, so when it comes to his record on that, Sheriff Clarke, I think that it\u2019s pretty undisputed.\u201d The ex-sheriff replied by saying that most people under the age of 35 don\u2019t know who John Lewis is before bringing up that if it weren\u2019t for Republicans, there\u2019d be no Civil Rights Act because President Lyndon Johnson had to get GOP votes to pass it. \u201cI appreciate that history lesson but as somebody that holds a degree on the subject I really don\u2019t need you to update me on who was required for Lyndon B. Johnson to pass the Civil Rights Act,\u201d Williams stated. \u201cApparently, you\u2019ve forgotten some of your history,\u201d Clarke retorted, leading Williams to smile back and tell him that she doesn\u2019t actually have anything against Republicans. Meanwhile, Hegseth jumped back in to help Clarke out by stating he wouldn\u2019t have even known about the museum if it wasn\u2019t for Trump\u2019s visit today. Of course, Clarke was completely in agreement with that comment. Watch the clip above, via Fox News.

The sign was also posted within 500 feet of an elementary school. Hart, who was allowed to keep his sign, said he is neither a supporter of Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump. He said his signs are protected by free speech, and if they continue to be taken down, he\u2019ll put them back up somewhere else.","label":0}
{"text":"Updates: Oregon occupation trial in Portland: PORTLAND, Ore. \u2013 Seven of the armed protesters who occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Eastern Oregon earlier this year stood trial in Portland. The defendants included brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy, the purported leaders of the occupation whose father, Cliven Bundy, led another armed standoff in Nevada in 2014. The Bundy brothers faced federal charges for both the Oregon and Nevada occupations. The Oregon occupation centered on felony charges of conspiracy. Federal prosecutors argued all of the defendants kept federal employees from doing their jobs during the occupation. Some also faced felony charges of theft of government property and possession of firearms at a federal facility. Related: What to know before the Bundy trial begins Jury selection began Sept. 7 and opening statements started Sept. 13. This is a log of updates from the trial. Oct. 27: The jury announced that a verdict was reached on all but one charge. The defendants were all found not guilty for conspiracy and possession of a firearm at a federal facility. The jury did not decide whether Ryan Bundy was guilty of theft of government property. Bundy supporters celebrated outside of the courtroom. Meanwhile, Ammon Bundy's lawyer, Marcus Mumford, was tased in the courtroom after he argued his client should be released from prison immediately. Oct. 26: One juror was dismissed after another questioned his impartiality. He was replaced with a woman from Central Oregon, known as \"Juror No. 18.\" Oct. 25: As jury deliberations continued, a note submitted to the judge questioned one juror's impartiality. Another note asked if the jurors needed to reach an agreement on all seven defendants. Oct. 18: The Bundy trial reached closing arguments. The lawyer for Ammon Bundy claimed his client was falsely accused, while a federal prosecutor told the jury to use common sense. Oct. 11: Ryan Bundy, who is representing himself, called his wife Angela to the stand. Bundy began crying before asking his wife about the standoff. Oct. 6: Ammon Bundy, who has been labeled the leader of the armed occupation, denied he was the leader of the standoff despite earlier testifying he was \u201csort of\u201d in charge. Oct. 4: Ammon Bundy\u2019s wife told reporters that she believes the \u201cjudge is very biased\u201d in the case. Sept. 29: Ammon Bundy\u2019s lawyers tried to stop the trial amid appeals, but the trial continued. Sept. 28: Defense makes case. The first day of the defense's case saw eight witnesses take the stand: four FBI agents, two refuge employees, a Siletz tribal member who visited the refuge and a Burns man who helped the occupiers for two days in January. Sept. 27: Parade of guns. The prosecution rested its case after presenting all 34 guns recovered from the refuge and more than 16,000 rounds of live ammunition. Sept. 26: Jurors shown video. Prosecutors showed jurors a video of protesters using assault rifles at the refuge as evidence the occupation was not a peaceful protest. Sept. 23: Threat of contempt. Judge Anna Brown threatened to hold Ammon Bundy's lawyer in contempt of court if he continues to bring up the death of protester Robert \"LaVoy\" Finicum. Sept. 21: Driver was government informant. An Oregon State Police trooper testified a government informant was driving Ammon Bundy when the Oregon standoff leader was arrested on his way to a community meeting. Sept. 19: Office trashed. A fish biologist testified that occupiers left her office at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge \"completely trashed.\" Sept. 16: Motion for mistrial. Ammon Bundy's lawyers filed a motion for mistrial, citing testimony from Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward, according to an Oregonian report. Ward was reportedly asked if he knew about the 2014 standoff led by Cliven Bundy, Ammon and Ryan's father. He referenced a story he saw about two people associated with that standoff who shot two police officers in an unrelated incident. Bundy's lawyers claimed the judge should have immediately struck the comment from record. The judge denied the motion. Sept. 15: Bundy dresses down. In a statement read by one of his attorneys, Bundy said he wants to drop the facade he is presumed innocent, and wear jail scrubs to dress like the political prisoner he is. Sept. 14: The first witness testified. Harney County Sheriff David Ward said the occupiers warned him that his county would be \"invaded by armed citizens\" if he didn't protect his constituents from the federal government. Sept. 13: Opening statements began. A handful of protesters showed up Tuesday outside the federal courthouse in downtown Portland, waving upside-down American Flags. They said they planned to march around the courthouse during the trial's lunch breaks. Sept. 12: The judge ruled that Facebook posts made by the defendants could be used as evidence against them. Sept. 7: Jury selection began. Prosecutors and defense attorneys chose twelve jurors and eight alternates from a pool of more than 250 Oregonians. The jury includes eight women and four men from throughout Oregon. The Associated Press contributed to this report.","label":0}

{"text":"The Democratic Party's obsession with Hollywood celebrities was bound to blow up | The Fresno Bee: The Democratic Party\u2019s obsession with Hollywood celebrities was bound to blow up. The party\u2019s reliance on the entertainment industry reached a crescendo during the 2016 presidential campaign when, according to the Wrap, at least 167 Hollywood elites endorsed Hillary Clinton. And these were not passive endorsements. For Democrats, celebrities became a meaningful source of money, message delivery and even a tool for crowd-building at Clinton\u2019s anemic campaign events. Anyway, Clinton lost and Donald Trump became president. And then came Harvey Weinstein, who, after having long been celebrated and enabled by the Democratic Party establishment, is now being exiled. But with some 30 women accusing Weinstein of offenses ranging from sexual harassment to rape, is the Weinstein scandal big enough to cause a break between the Democratic Party and the entertainment industry? The answer is no. Breaking News Be the first to know when big news breaks Recaptcha requires verification. protected by reCAPTCHA Privacy - Terms Privacy - Terms In January, I cited a useful piece written by New York Post writer and editor Maureen Callahan, \u201cWhy celebrity endorsements didn\u2019t help Hillary at all,\u201d and her words warrant repeating: \u201cThat those who have money, fame, privilege and status and have no cause to worry \u2013 and fail to do so \u2013 can only further divide the country and alienate those who, rightly, feel unseen, unheard and looked down upon.\u201d And after Clinton lost, Callahan wrote, \u201cthose celebrities who reacted publicly often did so with a pungent brew of self-pity, condescension and didacticism.\u201d Today, rather than pause and reflect, many Democrats, led by no less than Clinton, are attempting to deflect from the outcry over Weinstein and the long cover-up of his behavior by citing Trump \u2013 as if he is equally guilty. He is not. Clinton, who is obviously conflicted on the subject as she has a history of targeting women who have accused her husband of sexual assault and of enabling the alleged serial abuser, actually said, \u201cLook, we just elected someone who admitted sexual assault to the presidency.\u201d When I saw that comment, I was stunned to the point that I thought it might have been a spoof written by the Onion. The hypocrisy on display is stunning. It is a sure sign of the Democrats\u2019 detachment that they thought being surrounded by Hollywood\u2019s liberal stars would deliver votes. In Clinton\u2019s case, her appeal was so narrow that she began to rely on the rich and famous to not just provide extra flare at rallies, but also to actually be the headline attraction at her campaign events while she was just making an appearance on the sidelines. So, what will the half-life of the Weinstein scandal\u2019s impact be? Call me a cynic, but the Democrats will stick with Hollywood and there will be more Harvey Weinsteins. The Democrats need Hollywood and Hollywood is legendary for this behavior. Some Democrats knew this about Weinstein, and it is safe to say they probably know it about others today. The Democrats tolerate it because they are convinced that the star power \u2013 and the money \u2013 is worth it. The Democrats need the type of Hollywood show-ponies that Weinstein could control, in part because beyond criticizing Trump, Democrats really don\u2019t have a lot to say. They have become beholden to the special interests of entertainment industry elites, trial lawyers, environmentalists and an assortment of groups with a grievance. The entertainment industry is a core part of the Democratic coalition. Period. Yet Democrats are quickly moving on from the Weinstein scandal. While some have superficially distanced themselves from the now-disgraced mega-donor, the fact is that Democrats are largely holding on to his money. According to Politico, the Democratic National Committee has gotten rid of only a mere 10 percent of Weinstein\u2019s $300,000 in contributions. But is any of this a surprise? After all, you reap what you sow. And the Democrats\u2019 addiction to Hollywood is permanent. They are in denial. Addicts can\u2019t kick their habit unless they are committed to doing so.

{"text":"The Story of This Man\u2019s S*x Doll Being Stolen Is a Wild Ride From Start to Finish: The Mystery of the Stolen Doll There are some seriously strange people on the planet. Unfortunately in today\u2019s world, they are able to broadcast themselves on different social media outlets. Before our current technological advances, we knew they were out there, but we didn\u2019t really see them much. That\u2019s all changed now and the weirdos of the world are everywhere. One man proves that when he explains the case of his missing adult doll. This story is wild and will leave you guessing until the very end. Check out the story. Source: Instagram @b.l.o.themovie The Mystery of the Stolen Doll The journey begins when one man posts a picture of his new friend. He claims he did not purchase the doll, but that instead she was given to him. I feel it\u2019s important to mention that this man has a terrifying YouTube channel and I believe he is under the impression that he has fans. He seems be saying that the doll was given to him from an unknown fan. It\u2019s definitely a strange thing to post to Facebook. Then, the unthinkable happens! Oh no, she has been stolen! It would seem that an intruder had broken into this famous young man\u2019s home and the only thing they took was his beloved doll. He is alone and sad but luckily the police will keep him informed if they discover any information regarding this horrible crime. Good news, the doll has been found! Bad news, she has been chopped to bits by a crazy meth addict\/cook who was pulled over for a measly traffic violation! Coincidentally, this perpetrator will be locked away for life due to the amount of meth discovered in his car! Our guy is still very sad. \u201cGess\u201d he don\u2019t deserve \u201chappyness.\u201d The Mystery of the Stolen Doll Now, for the truly unexpected ending. This man (who is pictured above displaying his confidence) reveals that he, in fact was lying. He was eaten up with the guilt of his lie that he felt the only solution was for him to come clean. Do not forget, all of this he decided was appropriate to share on Facebook. He revealed that he was actually \u201cusing\u201d the doll when a terrible thing happened. He must have been pounding away a bit too violently when her lady parts ripped in half. Thank god this man is using an object instead of a woman because he got so mad at the doll that he chopped it to pieces and threw it away. Don\u2019t worry\u2014 he apologized to his friends and fans for lying. He left us with this, \u201cI was embarresed and Im sorry for lieing to friends and fans.\u201d Well, at least he apologized.

{"text":"Is feminism and women misandry for men just women showing their true faces for men?: Now throughout history women have always had a need for men to provide, give protection for them, strength, ingenuity, get food for them, and help build society up for them. Many feminist like to argue that the lack of female inventors was due to male oppression but the thing is when human existence was young, there was no social structure or patriarch put in place and women had the same equal opportunity as men to come to the discovery of tools\/make fire. Hell, a social experiment was done on survivors where men and women were serrated into 2 teams and men worked together to improve their living situation while women were left clueless and passively content with the way things are. So the driving force for our society progression has been men in term of technological advances and males were still valued and needed and women because of this were submissive, showed respect and were kind to men. Thanks to technological advances male physical strength is no longer needed as much by society, nor is male protection; a gun beats a big hulking man. Also seeing from the Western bubble we live in, many Western women will never experience the harsh effect of war or need a man to defend her against invaders which has only resulted in them no longer needing men as much. Thus, we see that in many aspect male duties that women once needed are no longer necessarily needed and this coincides right around the time in which feminism showed up. With feminism women seem to have now showed their true face and feeling for men it seems and have varying levels of misandry for men. It is like a fake ass friend who is nice to you because they need you but once you are no longer needed reveal what they truly think about you. Updates: By the way for those saying i hate women, this is not about hate but just me making a question based on observation. Feminism came around the time, society was stabilised with plenty food\/water\/shelter, there was no war or need for physical strength and basically where many of the usefulness women had for men became ended up becoming less and less important. This question is just asking based on this coincidence. Nah, lol, but misogyny is obviously poisoning brains of some weak and pathetic men who ignore the difference between feminism and feminazism:   As for the remark about communism and trump, I never mentioned either so I don't understand what your trying to say. If what I stated, if the organizations (which you neglected to address) and the protestors who are comprised of feminist (again you neglected to adress) if the intellectuals and the ones creating the philosophy and teaching it (which again you neglected to adress) are not actual feminist then what is a feminist and why would we call such a minority group within this particular group that has apparently completely different ideals and philosophies, feminist? What is a feminist then if not what I have presented? @hellionthesagereborn I never asked for your opinion, I said I don't care what you think, I know what kind of idiots invented so-called \"straw argument\", that bullshit is used just because they don't know what else to say as a reply to an argument they can't win, so they promote they \"fallacy\" idiotism (calling it \"logic\"), pretending to be \"smart\" by driveling Latin phrases, desperately trying to degrade other people with their egotism and annoying objections, but guess what, they always fail, or they get their asses kicked. Luckily for them, they are just \"internet warriors\", but in real life, they don't dare to face another person, they live like outcasts, in their parent's basements.Feminazi writers are not Feminists, I can say that I'm \"Alien\", or \"Doctor\", or \"Angel\" - but I'm not, Feminazis are just pretenders, not true Feminists.You can keep on living in your world of illusions, quasi-philosophy, and pseudo-intellectualism, but you'll never find a girlfriend that way No whats happening is feminist and liberals have been conditioning women to hate men, its not inherint otherwise things would be much worse (look at the propaganda against men and then see that most women despite treating men poorly do not treat them nearly as bad as you would expect with how much they are represented as monsters). Its basically the same thing that happens to a spoiled child. When you don't hold them to a standard, when you don't punish them for wrong doing, when you tell them they are above every one else from birth and then have both parents and schools and society stating the exact same things, how women are now is inevitable. Men would turn out the same way too except no one would ever put men on a pedestal to the detriment of women, we are biologically as well as socially inclined to revere women and view men as disposable.","label":1}

{"text":"Creepy Clown Threat Prompts Spooked Floridians To Trick-Or-Treat While Armed: sdominick via Getty Images Spooked Floridians say they are arming themselves against the threat of creepy clowns this Halloween. According to media reports, some residents in Brevard County plan to carry guns and other weapons while trick-or-treating on Monday night as protection against the kind of \u201ccreepy\u201d or \u201ckiller clown\u201d attacks and sightingsthat have swept the nation in recent months. \u201c I\u2019ll be carrying for sure, I\u2019m not leaving to chance,\u201d Kimberly Kersey, who planned to take her children trick-or-treating in Palm Bay, told Florida Today. \u201cI\u2019m terrified of clowns already and if one messes with me or my kids it\u2019ll be to the hospital or morgue they go.\u201d Pam Metz, of Titusville, said she will be \u201ccarrying around a bat on Halloween night.\u201d Lt. Mike Banish repeated that warning this week, cautioning that clown attack victims could think they were being robbed and that there was a very real possibility of \u201csomeone getting shot.\u201d Creepy clown reports first surfaced in August, when people dressed as a sinister version of the slapstick comic performers were allegedly attempting to entice young children into wooded areas in South Carolina. Since then, reports of clown attacks or sightings have spread to more than 20 states, AFP reported. Authorities said many of these clown reports were later shown to be hoaxes or unverifiable. Police chiefs across the country have spoken out against the craze, including Brian Lindquist of the Farmington Police Department in Minnesota, who issued a warning to a clown calling himself \u201cBobo\u201d: It later emerged that a child in the area had posed as \u201cBobo\u201d to scare a friend. Several creepy clowns have been arrested, including a man trespassing with a hatchet and a couple who left their 4-year-old daughter at home alone to go off haunting their town. But Benjamin Radford, clown expert and author of Bad Clowns, recently told HuffPost there was usually \u201cnothing to be worried about.\u201d","label":0}
{"text":"GOP Pins Its Dwindling Senate Hopes On The FBI: FBI Director James Comey WASHINGTON \u2015 Whether or not FBI Director James Comey wanted to upset next week\u2019s election by revealing the bureau is again looking at Hillary Clinton emails, the National Republican Senatorial Committee is trying to leverage that news to buttress its dwindling chances of keeping the Senate. According to HuffPost Pollster\u2019s detailed poll modeling, the Republicans\u2019 chances of maintaining a majority in the upper chamber are down to 17 percent \u2015 a precipitous fall from a couple of weeks ago when they had about a 60 percent shot at holding on. That fall has continued since Comey\u2019s October surprise, but the NRSC is pretty sure the oft-discussed and investigated Clinton emails will reinvigorate their chances. To that end, the committee dropped a new ad Tuesday aimed primarily at the web that tries to use the new news to motivate voters whose distaste for GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump might have clouded their memories about how little they like his Democratic rival. \u201cIt\u2019s time to start asking why are Democrat Senate candidates still standing with Hillary Clinton?\u201d the spot states. A montage then runs that includes Clinton meeting with Arab leaders, a smashed computer, and 1984-like footage that appears lifted from an old ad supporting President Barack Obama in 2008. \u201cThey already know about the smashed private email servers, sketchy meetings, shady political donations, special immunity deals,\u201d the commercial continues. \u201cNow Hillary Clinton is under FBI investigation\u2026 again,\u201d it says, before noting that a pro-Clinton Super PAC, Priorities USA, is backing the Democrats. (The ad is called \u201cPriorities H.R.C.\u201d) \u201cIf these Democrat Senate candidates are letting her get away with these scandals now, just imagine what they would let Hillary Clinton get away in the White House, the spot concludes. The FBI has still not suggested its latest review of the former secretary of state will change its earlier decision that she broke no laws, and there\u2019s little evidence that Comey\u2019s announcement has moved voters. But the NRSC at least thinks Comey\u2019s move could help the GOP. \u201cDemocrat Senate candidates across the country must now spend the last week of the campaign explaining to voters why they are so eager to vouch for Hillary Clinton\u2019s honesty and trustworthiness,\u201d said NRSC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek. Watch the spot below. If the GOP\u2019s new ad didn\u2019t make clear how Republicans feel about Comey\u2019s decision to raise the issue of Clinton\u2019s email near the end of the election, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) told supporters over the weekend that Comey\u2019s letter to Congress Friday was a gift. In audio obtained by CNN, Burr was frank in describing how tough it would be to get his own voters out to the polls. \u201cI know that people are on the fence. Some of them are Republicans. We got to get \u2018em off the fence, folks. We gotta get them to the point where they say, \u2018I\u2019m gonna do it,\u2019\u201d Burr told supporters in an eastern North Carolina gun shop. \u201cAnd we were given a gift yesterday,\u201d said Burr, who is locked in a tough re-election fight with former Democratic state Rep. Deborah Ross. \u201cI walked into a rally in Smithfield, and I said, \u2018Let me show you what I got today,\u2019 and I pulled out of my pocket my letter from Jim Comey, opening up the investigation again.\u201d This post has been updated with comments made by Sen. Richard Burr.","label":0}
{"text":"Paul Manafort Insists He\u2019s Clean, Nothing To See Here, Folks: WASHINGTON \u2013 When last we saw Paul Manafort, international consigliere and erstwhile chairman of the Donald Trump campaign, he was heading out the door and into radio silence. His six-month campaign stint ended in August after he lost clout with the boss and following a wave of stories about his lucrative role as a consultant to and lobbyist for a pro-Russia Ukrainian leader. But Manafort resurfaced on Tuesday to deny to HuffPost that he was under investigation for alleged ties to Russia, its hackers or its president, Vladimir Putin. Or for anything else. Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, have complained that FBI Director James Comey \u2013 so willing to besmirch Hillary Clinton by revealing the bureau\u2019s interest in Huma Abedin\u2019s emails \u2013 was unwilling to discuss an FBI investigation into Trump\u2019s ties to Putin. Part of that probe allegedly focused on Manafort\u2019s work in Eastern Europe. In fact, the FBI has found no direct link between Trump and Russia, at least thus far, according to The New York Times. Comey\u2019s reluctance to discuss the status of such a probe could well be because there\u2019s nothing to reveal. \u201cThere is no story,\u201d Manafort insisted to me. \u201cThis is just Harry Reid and Clinton deflection.\u201d Comey, for his part, has not commented. NBC News reported Monday that Manafort was the subject of an \u201cinquiry\u201d into his foreign business activities \u2013 an assertion that he hotly denies. \u201cThe NBC story is an outrageous smear,\u201d Manafort said to me. \u201cThere is nothing of my business activities to investigate. There is no FBI investigation and even NBC admitted that there is no criminal investigation.\u201d \u201cThis is presidential politics and nothing more,\u201d he added. As Manafort\u2019s own carefully worded denial suggests, there could, at some point, be an inquiry into his work, perhaps into whether he registered as a \u201cforeign agent\u201d for Ukraine in the U.S. or whether he inappropriately funneled money from Ukraine into lobbying efforts. But those evidently would be topics for another, lower-temperature time. \u201cThere is NO activity,\u201d Manafort said. In the meantime, his old boss (they evidently haven\u2019t spoken much, if at all, since August) could become president of the United States. \u201cI think it is now even money\u201d that Trump will win, Manafort said. \u201cIt\u2019s moving like Reagan-Carter in 1980.\u201d HUFFPOST READERS: What\u2019s happening in your state or district?

{"text":"Surprise, Surprise, Donald Trump\u2019s Supporters Are Trying To \u2018Rig\u2019 The Election: The GOP presidential nominee has repeatedly called for his supporters to watch polling places throughout the election and intimidate voters. His supporters are doing just that. Some groups have vowed to conduct fake \u201cexit polls,\u201d videotape voters and use fake identity badges to pose as voting officials. One supporter told it like it is, just like his hero Trump does, and revealed to The Boston Globe who he\u2019d be looking for at the polls: \u201cWell, it\u2019s called racial profiling. Mexicans. Syrians. People who can\u2019t speak American.\u201d Trump has complained \u2015 prior to a single ballot being cast \u2015 that the election is \u201crigged\u201d and told his voter base to be wary voter fraud. His supporters are doing just that. A Trump supporter in Iowa was arrested this week for casting two ballots in the general election, claiming fears over a \u201crigged\u201d election. She\u2019s one of three people suspected of voter fraud in Polk County, Iowa, though she was the only one arrested. His running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R), has proclaimed voter fraud on his home turf. Now there appears to be just that. The Indiana Voter Registration Program boasts that it was able to sign up 40,000 new voters in the state \u2015 many of them African-American \u2015 until Republican leaders stepped in to claim voter fraud. Now State Police Superintendent Doug Carter is investigating an \u201cunusually high number of date of birth and first name changes\u201d among the new voters. Indiana Democrats claim the investigation itself is politically motivated. Police haven\u2019t yet found evidence of real voter fraud among Democrats there. Worry over a \u201crigged\u201d election has run rampant among Trump\u2019s voter base. But those constituents are one step behind Trump, who on Friday changed his tune completely after the FBI announced that it was reviewing new emails to determine whether they\u2019re connected in any way to his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. \u201cIt might not be as rigged as I thought, right?\u201d he said at a rally in New Hampshire after the news broke. \u201cThe FBI, I think they\u2019re going to right the ship, folks.\u201d Once again, hysteria that Trump\u2019s vitriol manufactured has led to crime or sketchy circumstances \u2015 among his own supporters.

{"text":"The Oppression and Mass Execution of African-American Men will Cripple America: Black Men in Ferguson (Hands Up, Don\u2019t shoot) The not guilty verdict and acquittal of all charges against George Zimmerman in the case of Trayvon Martin, the decision to not indict Cleveland Police Officers-Timothy Loehmann and Frank Garmback for the murder and the cover up shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, and the failure to indict ex-police officer Darren Wilson in the case of Mike Brown, along with other similar cases, have angered many people, largely because most people still feel that \u201cjustice\u201d was not served in these cases. Many believe these cases exhibit the state-sanctioned killings of young African-American men. In many ways, those who are offset by the murders are right. What we can all agree on is that the facts overwhelmingly show that all the mentioned cases are tragedies, without question! Many believe that race played a role in most, if not all, of these judgments. So, what does this demonstrate about our country\u2019s ability \u2015 or lack thereof \u2015 to provide justice for all and protect it\u2019s citizens? Let\u2019s discuss these questions. Let\u2019s be honest, circumstantially most Black people believe they just don\u2019t have the privileges or immunities of citizenship or due process \u2015 of life, liberty or even equal protection of laws granted to other citizens (they are right in many ways). Within the African-American community, most, when asked, will say that they have never stopped being marginalized, criminalized and convicted for their skin color, beginning during slavery, and lasting into the economic and psychological era of slavery that we now call the new Jim Crow. Strangely enough, there is a similarity between all these cases, but there are some lingering questions we must ask ourselves. We could ask, \u201cWhy would any police routinely be allowed take the life of citizens, time after time, and not abide by their public mandate, which is to \u2018serve and protect?\u2019\u201d Today, we have questionable cases like Alton Sterling and others. The police murders keep stocking up, and for the most part, the only change around the country is that we are seeing more tragic cases of police murder everyday. As a nation, did we fail? Ultimately, some of these more disturbing questions will be answered by police internal affairs investigators, government officials and civic leaders. Other questions \u2014 the deeper, subliminal ones that ask about equality and intolerance \u2014 must be answered within our classrooms and our courtrooms. These deeper questions have now gone out from our living rooms and onto our televisions in our homes. Their very existence attests that we, as a black nation, have failed our Trayvon Martins, Mike Browns and our Tamir Rices, as well as all young black men. Before his highly controversial death at the hands of a white police officer, Michael Brown had graduated from Normandy High School \u2013 a school whose academic standards and finances were so poor that it had been declared \u201cunaccredited\u201d by Missouri state education authorities. During the 2011-2012 school year, 829 young black men and women were meted out one out-of-school suspension by Ferguson-Florissant. That\u2019s 8.1 percent of the 10,197 black children attending the district\u2019s schools, according to data submitted to the U.S. Department of Education. A recent study by the Office for Civil Rights shows that the percentage of young black men suspended from school (as Trayvon Martin was) is far greater than that of their peers of other nationalities. However, Chief Charles Hurley of the Miami-Dade School Police Department (MDSPD) had implemented a policy in 2010 that reduced the number of criminal reports, manipulating statistics to create the appearance of a reduction in crime within the school system. Less than two weeks before Martin\u2019s death, the school system commended Chief Hurley for \u201cdecreasing school-related juvenile delinquency by an impressive 60 percent for the last six months of 2011.\u201d Another study, by The Sentencing Project, examines vastly disproportionate rates of incarceration for African-American Men. We should be asking ourselves, \u201cWhy do these disparities exist?\u201d Deep rooted victim complexes. Please Note: Trayvon Martin and Mike Brown both were not just victims of their seemingly racist killers alone. They all are victims of the lopsided school systems that failed them. They are victims of a police force that overwhelmingly assumes first that most young black men are criminals, thugs and near animals \u2015 followed by an outright fear of them. They are a victims of bad legislation, like the Florida\u2019s Stand Your Ground law, that gives anyone who wills the unfettered right to kill blacks and others if they feel threatened in any way. They are victims of a certain moral blindness \u2013 which means every single black person, in the eyes of a racist, symbolizes a terrible crime from their ugly past, a reminder that their life is a fraud. These racists need to simply own up to their ugly past of slavery and make it right by society, instead of denying, shifting blame, lying, twisting the facts and making black people into these ungodly creatures that they look down on, laugh at and yet, oddly, fear. This is a failed attempt to be at \u201cpeace,\u201d with themselves. This must stop. The truth will eventually surface. We need more love in our communities! We need to love and accept our children unconditionally. Regardless of our child\u2019s age, we have to instill feelings of acceptance and self-worth. Teach children, by how you treat them, that they are valuable and worthy of love. It doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t agree with every choice or interest of your child.Tomorrow, look around your community, your home. Do you have any Trayvon Martins? As an educator, you have the power to stave off feelings of emptiness after another young Mike Brown\u2019s death. Talk to your children about racism \u2015 tell them that Tamir Rice was just an innocent child whose death was motivated by racism. Question any legislation that endorses police vigilantism. Speak up against police inaction. Then, tell your child that he is protected, first by God, and then you. Afterward, we must champion our children\u2019s rights. Then add a training session to the life lesson for your young men and women about the existence of systematic racism and oppression \u2015 be honest with them, tell them the odds are against them, but they can overcome if they have righteous will and fortitude. Nothing will fully fill the void created in the lost lives of Tamir, Trayvon and Mike for family, friends and teachers. But Tamir, Trayvon and Mike\u2019s empty desks must become symbols of awareness and change \u2014 a sign to our society that the current state of affairs is not acceptable, and we won\u2019t let racists, or anyone else, destroy us and our future without a fight!

{"text":"Hillary Clinton Says Donald Trump \u2018Choked\u2019 On Border Wall: LAS VEGAS \u2015 Hillary Clinton questioned Donald Trump\u2019s ability to close a deal during Wednesday night\u2019s presidential debate here. \u201cWhen it comes to the wall that Donald talked about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president, didn\u2019t even raise it,\u201d Clinton said, referencing a meeting between Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in August. Pe\u00f1a Nieto said afterward that he told Trump Mexico wouldn\u2019t pay for the wall as Trump had repeatedly promised his supporters. Clinton dissed Trump\u2019s visit with Pe\u00f1a Nieto in the course of an answer in which she portrayed herself as the much more humane candidate on immigration. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rip families apart,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be sending parents away from children. I don\u2019t want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country. We have 11 million undocumented people. They have four million American citizen children.\u201d Trump, for his part, initially seemed to confirm that he wanted to focus on deportation, saying that Mexican drug lords had to be rounded up, which has been a core theme of his campaign. \u201cWe have some bad hombres here and we\u2019re going to get them out,\u201d Trump said. But he glossed over his plans to deport as many other undocumented immigrants as possible. He also veered between arguing Clinton wants amnesty and an open border and insisting she wanted a wall along the southwest border and tying her to President Barack Obama\u2019s deportation numbers. He was referring to Clinton\u2019s vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which mandated the creation of hundreds of miles of border fencing that is still unfinished. Trump has said his border wall would be different from the fencing that currently exists \u2015 in suggesting Clinton\u2019s position was the same as his, he was really just arguing against his own claims that she opposes border security. \u201cHillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn\u2019t built. But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.\u201d Each of the candidates brought guests to call out while they discussed immigration. Trump invited four people whose family members were killed by undocumented immigrants, while Clinton called out 11-year-old Karla Ortiz, a U.S. citizen whose parents are undocumented. Immigration is a huge issue in Nevada \u2015 undocumented immigrants make up 7 percent of the state\u2019s population, a higher share than any other state, according to the most recent estimates from Pew Research Center. The fates of those undocumented immigrants and their families would be vastly different under Trump or Clinton. Trump launched his campaign by vowing to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico \u2015 that Mexico would pay for \u2015 to prevent what he painted as a scourge of criminals crossing the border without authorization. He repeatedly promised over the ensuing year that all undocumented immigrants would have to leave the country should he become president, although some might be able to return legally. In August, Trump encouraged speculation that he was reconsidering his hardline stance on deportations, before confirming in early September that he would ramp up enforcement and attempt to drive out other undocumented immigrants by making it harder for them to live in the country. Clinton supports legislation to grant legal status to many of the undocumented immigrants with longstanding ties to the country, and eventually allow them to gain citizenship. In the meantime, she has said she would use her executive powers to protect some from deportation \u2015 going beyond what President Barack Obama attempted. She also made a spate of other immigration reform promises, such as shutting down private detention centers and expanding access to lawyers for people in deportation proceedings. Immigration isn\u2019t typically the top issue for Latino voters, but does rank higher among them than the overall population. And Trump appears poised for a bigger loss with Latino voters than failed 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who infamously called for undocumented immigrants to \u201cself-deport\u201d and then received only 27 percent of the Latino vote. Latino voters heavily favor Clinton to Trump: An NBC News\/Wall Street Journal\/Telemundo poll released this week found that 70 percent would choose Clinton and 17 percent would choose Trump in a head-to-head matchup.

{"text":"Joe Arpaio: Disgraced sheriff pardoned by Trump to run for Arizona Senate seat: Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio speaks in support of Donald Trump during a Trump campaign rally The controversial sheriff who Donald Trumppardoned has announced he is running for the US Senate to help \"Make America Great Again\". Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio \u2013 who the Justice Department claims oversaw the worst pattern of racial profiling by a law enforcement agency in US history \u2013 said he will run for the Senate in Arizona next year. \"I am running for the U.S. Senate from the Great State of Arizona, for one unwavering reason: to support the agenda and policies of President Donald Trump in his mission to Make America Great Again,\" Mr Arpaio tweeted on Tuesday. Read more The announcement puts him in the middle of a crowded Republican primary race to replace current Arizona Senator Jeff Flake \u2013 a frequent critic of Mr Trump. US Representative Martha McSally and former state Senator Kelli Ward are both vying for the seat. Mr Arpaio told the Washington Examiner that he planned to \"work hard\" and not \"take anything for granted\" in the race. \"But I would not being doing this if I thought that I could not win,\" he added. \"I\u2019m not here to get my name in the paper, I get that everyday, anyway.\u201d Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez called the announcement \"sad and disturbing,\" and said his party would fight \"tooth and nail\" to prevent Mr Arpaio from holding office. Mr Arpaio was Mr Trump's first pardon, and one of his first supporters. He was convicted of criminal contempt of court last year for defying an order to stop officers from detaining people based solely on suspicion of their immigration status. The former sheriff's strict stance on immigration helped catapult him to national fame, and into the President's good graces. During his six terms in office, Mr Arpaio led a department with \u201ca pervasive culture of discriminatory bias against Latinos,\u201d according to the Justice Department. Under Mr Arpaio's tenure, Latino drivers were unfairly targeted for traffic stops, and Spanish-speaking prisoners were punished for failing to understand officer's orders in English. Inmates were occasionally forced to wear pink underwear and sleep in sweltering \"tent cities\" as punishment. Mr Trump called the sheriff a \"great American patriot\" and claimed he had \"done a lot in the fight against illegal immigration,\" in an interview with Fox News in August. \"Was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing his job?\" he wondered at a campaign rally later that month. The President's decision to pardon Mr Arpaio was condemned by many on the left and right \u2013 including Arizona's two Republican Senators, Mr Flake and John McCain. Mr Arpaio dismissed the Senators' comments on Tuesday, telling NBC News: \"I don't have to talk to them.\" The 85-year-old also played off concerns about his age, saying he only planned to serve one term. \"I\u2019ll gun anybody,\" he told NBC. \"What\u2019s the age got to do with it?\" Mr Trump has yet to endorse in the race.","label":0}

In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, the former Democratic presidential nominee admitted that while she \"probably would have\" put herself in the producer's camp prior to the accusations, she felt \"sick\" and \"shocked\" after numerous Tinseltown A-listers came forward with their own accounts of sexual misconduct from the former Weinstein Company executive. \"I was appalled,\" the one-time Secretary of State said. \"It was something that was just intolerable in every way. And, you know, like so many people who've come forward and spoken out, this was a different side of a person who I and many others had known in the past.\" The politician, who has received campaign donations from Weinstein in the past, continued her condemnation. \"People in Democratic politics for a couple of decades appreciated his help and support,\" she said. \"And I think these stories coming to light now\u2014and people who never spoke out before having the courage to speak out\u2014just clearly demonstrates that this behavior that he engaged in cannot be tolerated.\" While Clinton says that she cannot return the Miramax co-founder's past monetary contributions, she hopes to channel his donations toward charity. \"What other people are saying, what my former colleagues are saying, is they're going to donate it to charity, and of course I will do that,\" she concluded. \"I give 10 percent of my income to charity every year, this will be part of that.

{"text":"The 11 states that could decide the result of the US Presidential election: Donald Trump with Hillary Clinton taking centre stage When voters go to the polls on November 8 the outcome of the US presidential election will be decided in a few key battlegrounds. Of the 50 states only 11 will determine whether it is President Hillary Clinton or President Donald Trump who enters the White House. And of these 11 states there are three that matter more than anywhere else: Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. If Clinton can win just one of these three states then she is all but secured of becoming the country\u2019s 45th President. Under the US system each state has number of electoral college votes reflecting its population size. Little New Hampshire has just four electoral college votes while California has 55. To win the presidency you need get 270 of the 538 electoral college votes up for grabs. And Clinton already has a major advantage. There 18 states - the Blue Wall - that have voted Democrat in the last six Presidential races and there is no evidence they are going to change colour this time round. This means she already has 242 electoral college votes in the bag. Trump needs to protect the 206 electoral college votes won by Mitt Romney in 2012 and then find another 64. Here\u2019s where Clinton and Trump are fighting for the votes: Florida The Sunshine State is the big one. With 29 electoral college votes it is a must win for Trump if he has any chance of getting to the White House. For Clinton a win in Florida, even if she loses in Ohio and Pennsylvania, will secure her victory. According to the US website FiveThirtyEight Clinton has a 70% chance of winning in Florida. In the ten polls of the state carried out since October 18 , Clinton has led in nine, with just one putting Trump ahead by 1%. But others have detected a late shift to the Republican and say the result is a toss up. Latest odds from FiveThirtyEight: Clinton 70% Trump 30% Ohio Since the Second World War only once has Ohio failed to back the winning presidential candidate. That was in 1960 when it went for Richard Nixon over John F Kennedy. Otherwise it has been the case of \u201cwin Ohio, win the presidency.\u201d But this year could be different. Trump\u2019s anti-globalisation message has struck accord with the blue-collar workers in the state. The last five polls have put him narrowly ahead . With 18 electoral college votes, he must bank the Buckeye State to have any chance. Latest odds from FiveThirtyEight: Clinton 54.4% Trump 46.4% Pennsylvania This former industrial heartland should be natural Trump territory. And with 20 electoral college votes in play, the Republican needs to win the Keystone State. But Pennsylvania last voted for a Republican in 1988 and is now considered a Democrat shoo-in. All the polls have put Clinton comfortably ahead with a lead of between 5% and 11%. Latest odds from FiveThirtyEight: Clinton 88.4% Trump 11.6% Georgia The Southern State with 16 electoral college votes used to be solid Democrat territory until it turned against the party in 1964 in protest at the Civil Rights Act. The last time it voted Democrat blue was in 1992 when they went for Bill Clinton. There is an outside chance it could vote for a Clinton again but most of the polls have Trump ahead by between two or three points. Latest odds from FiveThirtyEight: Clinton 28.9% Trump 71.1% Arizona This should be a Republican stronghold and 11 electoral college votes in the bank for Trump. It has voted for the Grand Old Party in every Presidential election since 1952 except for 1996 when it backed Bill Clinton. Democrats are hoping to pull off another surprise result this year. The polls have the race neck and neck between Trump and Clinton with neither being able to establish a clear lead. Latest odds from FiveThirtyEight: Clinton 56.4% Trump 43.6% Iowa If you want to take temperature of American politics travel to Iowa. The state has swung between Democrats and Republicans like a dog which cannot decide its owner. It went for George W Bush in 2004 and then Obama in 2008 and 2012. With just six electoral votes the prize is not huge but could prove decisive in a tight race. The last three polls have put Trump marginally ahead. Latest odds from FiveThirtyEight: Clinton 52.3% Trump 47.7% Michigan After years of voting Republican, Michigan went blue in 1992 and has stayed with them ever since. Trump had hoped to reverse the pattern in the Great Lake State which has suffered from industrial decline. But barring a last minute setback the state is set to stay with the Democrats. Clinton has led in every poll in the last month and looks set to pick up the 16 electoral college votes. Latest odds from FiveThirtyEight: Clinton 89.3% Trump 10.7% Nevada Once a Republican stronghold, Nevada has become a battleground state in recent elections. The Silver State went for Bill Clinton in the 1990s before returning George W Bush\u2019s Republicans. In the last two presidential races they backed Barack Obama. With six electoral college votes, the race is neck and neck between Trump and Clinton. Clinton led in several polls but the latest surveys point to a narrow win for the business mogul. Latest odds from FiveThirtyEight: Clinton 71.1% Trump 28.8% New Hampshire One of the 13 founding states New Hampshire is surrounded by a sea of Democrat blue. But this little state, with just four electoral college votes, revels in its independence. It last voted Republican in 2000 and there are few signs it will return red this year. In every recent poll Clinton has been in the lead. Latest odds from FiveThirtyEight: 85.1% Trump 14.9% North Carolina In 2008 Barack Obama broke the trend by winning the state for the first time since 1976. But the Democrat tenure was short lived as they were evicted by the Republicans in 2012 - one of the few states Mitt Romney took back from Obama. The Democrats are campaigning intensively this time round with repeat visits from Clinton and sending Michelle Obama there to help. With 15 electoral college votes it could ease Clinton\u2019s path to the White House if she can pull off a surprise win. Of the last 8 polls in the state, Trump has only been ahead in one. Latest odds from FiveThirtyEight: Clinton 68.5% Trump 31.5% Wisconsin After backing Ronald Reagan in the 1980s Wisconsin has been solidly Democrat in every presidential race since 1988. But the run of blue wins were not a walkover and Obama only won by a narrow margin four years\u2019 ago. With ten electoral college votes, Clinton will be keen to win in the Badger State. The latest polls point to her being on course for victory. Latest odds from FiveThirtyEight: Clinton 87.2% Trump 12.8%","label":0}
{"text":"Liberty U. Students: \u2018Donald Trump &amp; Jerry Falwell Jr. Don\u2019t Represent Us\u2019: Liberty University students want to be free \u2014 of their president\u2019s surrogacy for Donald Trump. On Wednesday, a group of students calling themselves \u201c Liberty United Against Trump\u201d released a letter dissociating themselves from the Republican nominee and his chief Evangelical surrogate:  In the months since Jerry Falwell Jr. endorsed him, Donald Trump has been inexorably associated with Liberty University. We are Liberty students who are disappointed with President Falwell\u2019s endorsement and are tired of being associated with one of the worst presidential candidates in American history. Donald Trump does not represent our values and we want nothing to do with him. A majority of Liberty students, faculty, and staff feel as we do. Donald Trump received a pitiful 90 votes from Liberty students in Virginia\u2019s primary election, a colossal rejection of his campaign. Nevertheless, President Falwell eagerly uses his national platform to advocate for Donald Trump. While he occasionally clarifies that supporting Trump is not the official position of Liberty University, he knows it is his title of president of the largest Christian university in the world that gives him political credentials. Associating any politician with Christianity is damaging to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. But Donald Trump is not just any politician. He has made his name by maligning others and bragging about his sins. Not only is Donald Trump a bad candidate for president, he is actively promoting the very things that we as Christians ought to oppose.  The slow-motion suicide of the Religious Right \u2014 which has been very publicly conducted over the course of this election cycle \u2014 is, among much else, a product of distinctly generational loyalties. It\u2019s no coincidence that most of the Evangelical leaders who have bent the knee to Trump are Baby Boomers: As Yuval Levin has argued, it\u2019s a whole generation, on both Right and Left, for whom nostalgia is the overarching mood. For Christians who came of age during the years of the Moral Majority, that entails a yearning to figure out how to restore the cultural consensus of postwar Christian America \u2014 a yearning that ignores that such an America only ever half-existed, at best, and that has led many to reduce the high duties of faith to the mechanics of national politics. But a much more confident faith is on display among younger Evangelical leaders \u2014 Russell Moore, for example, president of the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s Ethics  ; Religious Liberty Convention. These Liberty students are another example. Here\u2019s how they end their statement:  We are not proclaiming our opposition to Donald Trump out of bitterness, but out of a desire to regain the integrity of our school. While our president Jerry Falwell Jr. tours the country championing the log in his eye, we want the world to know how many students oppose him. We don\u2019t want to champion Donald Trump; we want only to be champions for Christ.  Amen. Take a moment to read the statement in full.     ","label":1}
{"text":"How Democrats Corrupt English to Create Hysteria: Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer discuss the GOP tax-reform bill on Capitol Hill in November. (Reuters photo: Joshua Roberts) Whenever passable Republican legislation materializes \u2014 a rarity these days \u2014 Democrats quickly warn that thousands, or perhaps even millions, of lives are at stake. Tax reform? Health care? Bogus international treaties? Internet regulations that were instituted only last year? It really doesn\u2019t matter. Longstanding conservative ideas are not only wrong; they portend the end of America as we know it. Why are liberals so apocalyptic and bellicose about tax reform (a rare cut that is, according to the sometimes-reliable Washington Post fact-checkers, only the eighth largest in history)? Well, everyone in politics tends to dramatize the consequences of policy for effect. A modern Democratic party drifting toward Bernie-ism, though, is far more likely to legitimately perceive any cuts in taxation as a limiting of state control, and thus an attack on all decency and morality. Taxation, after all, is the finest tool of redistribution. So it\u2019s understandable. But that\u2019s not all of it. With failure comes frustration, and with frustration there is a need to ratchet up the panic-stricken rhetoric. It\u2019s no longer enough to hang nefarious personal motivations on your political opponents \u2014 although it certainly can\u2019t hurt! Good political activists must now corrupt language and ideas to imbue their ham-fisted arguments with some kind of basic plausibility. Many liberal columnists, for example, will earnestly argue that Republicans \u2014 who at this moment control the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the White House, thanks to our free and fair elections \u2014 are acting undemocratically when passing bills. As you know, democracy means raising taxes on the minority. What else could it mean? But the most obvious and ubiquitous of the Left\u2019s contorted contentions about the tax bill deliberately muddles the concept of giving and the concept of taking. This distortion is so embedded in contemporary political rhetoric that I\u2019m not sure most of the progressive foot soldiers even think it\u2019s odd to say anymore. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t lower everyone\u2019s taxes, because it creates deficits and makes it harder to expand important programs like Medicaid\u201d doesn\u2019t have quite the same jolt as \u201cYou\u2019re killing the poor!\u201d And yet, whatever you make of the separate tax bills in the House and Senate, the authors are not taking one penny from anyone (unless you consider debt a tax on future generations, which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case for either party). In fact, no spending is being cut (unfortunately). Not one welfare program is being given a block grant. Not one person is losing a subsidy. It\u2019s just a traditional wide-ranging tax cut without any concurrent spending cuts. To believe that taxing at a moderately lower rate is the same as \u201ctaking\u201d from the poor, you must believe the following: Some arbitrary rates concocted by politicians many years ago for corporations, child credits, or deductions are now baselines that all future generations must hold sacred and\/or the state has a natural right to your property, and whatever you keep is stolen from the collective. Or, of course, you might just be extraordinarily dishonest. Because it\u2019s perfectly legitimate and comprehensible to stake a position that argues that government has a duty to create a fairer nation by redistributing money from the well-off to the less fortunate. Our progressive federal tax code already places most of the tax burden on the wealthy, but perhaps you believe they should pay more. I get it; you\u2019re worried about income inequality. On the other hand, it is preposterous to claim \u2014 as many journalists have \u2014 that lowering rates across the board is a state-sponsored \u201ctransfer\u201d of wealth. And no amount of pseudoscientific explainer charts will alter reality.  These perversions of basic language aren\u2019t new, but they are becoming more prevalent.  For that matter, overturning the Obamacare mandate to purchase health insurance \u2014 a market coercion masquerading, for purely legal purposes, as a tax \u2014 does not mean that any Americans will have lost \u201caccess\u201d to health-care insurance, as the vast majority of liberal pundits claim. That the Left deliberately confuses consumer choice with a lack of availability says something about its growing authoritarian inclinations. These perversions of basic language aren\u2019t new, but they are becoming more prevalent. Democrats routinely refer to legal actions they disapprove of as \u201cloopholes\u201d and claim that conservatives are trying to \u201cban\u201d contraception because they don\u2019t want buying it to be a collective responsibility. These aren\u2019t typical political euphemisms; these are a corrosion of language that we shouldn\u2019t allow to be normalized.

{"text":"The Ryan Lochte story just keeps getting weirder: Lochte wasn\u2019t entirely truthful. Source:AP AMERICAN swimmer Ryan Lochte has changed elements of a story claiming he and fellow teammates were robbed at gunpoint by thieves impersonating police in Rio. The 32-year initially claimed he was in a taxi with several members of the US swim team before they were pulled over, forced to the ground and had their wallets stolen. When he initially refused to lay down, Lochte said one of the robbers cocked a gun and put it against his head. However, he has since changed tack slightly, reportedly telling NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer they weren\u2019t in fact pulled over, and he did not have a gun put to his head. Instead, he said the swimmers had a gun pointed in their direction when they emerged from a petrol station rest room and tried to get into a taxi, only for the driver to prevent them from getting in. He then claimed the driver refused to move before two men approached the car and told them to get on the ground. He stuck to his story about refusing to lay down while his teammates obliged, saying: \u201cI have no reason to get on the ground. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t make a story up. We\u2019re victims in this,\u201d Lochte reportedly told Lauer.  Matt Lauer on NBC says Ryan Lochte changed his story in call today. No longer says gun was put to his head, nor that they were pulled over\u2014 Jon Swaine (@jonswaine) August 18, 2016   Lauer: Lochte now says they were ambushed after using gas stn restroom when cab driver refused to drive, gun was \"pointed in his direction\"\u2014 Jon Swaine (@jonswaine) August 18, 2016  As if the story couldn\u2019t get more confusing, American sportscaster Bob Costas later interviewed Lauer about his interview with Lochte. Lauer said the swimmer had altered parts of his story, but the guts of it remained true. \u201cHe did (tweak his story),\u201d Lauer said. \u201cHe stuck to most of the story. He did change one thing. I would say he softened some things, or stepped back. \u201cOne thing he did not say this time \u2014 he didn\u2019t say he was pulled over by these people pretending to be police.\u201d Lauer then told Costas why Lochte may have changed details about having a gun cocked to his head. \u201cI think he feels it was more of a traumatic mischaracterisation. I think people listening at home might think that it was an embellishment at the time, but that is up for people to decide.\u201d Earlier, Lochte had told NBC\u2019s Billy Bush the robbers pulled out police badges when approaching him. Lochte re-telling his story. Source:Twitter \u201cI was with a couple of swimmers. We were coming back from a friend\u2019s house. We got pulled over in our taxi. These guys came out with a badge, a police badge. No lights. No nothing. Just a police badge. \u201cThey pulled us over. They pulled out their guns.\u201d Lochte\u2019s story was called into question when footage emerged of the swimmers appearing to re-enter the Olympic Village with their wallets. Yesterday a Rio judge ordered Lochte, Gunna Betz and Jack Conger\u2019s passports be seized so they could be brought in for further questioning, suggesting there were doubts about the veracity of their claims. Lochte, though, had already flown home to the US, but as reported by The Daily Telegraph, Betz and Conger were detained at Rio airport on their way home. It\u2019s understood they were escorted off their plan for questioning. Federal police reportedly boarded the plane and took the swimmers with them.","label":0}
{"text":"Las Vegas shooting: At least 50 dead, 200 injured: A \"crazed lunatic\" turned an outdoor concert into a bloodbath, killing 59 people in what is now the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. Thousands of country music fans ran for cover Sunday night as a gunman fired hundreds of bullets at them from a hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, officials said. At least 527 people were hurt in the gunfire and ensuing stampede at the Jason Aldean concert, police said. PHOTOS: Las Vegas Strip shooting RELATED: Brother of Vegas gunman speaks out RELATED: Concerts targeted by rampage killers, terrorists \"About five feet from me, you could see a guy with a bullet wound right in his neck, motionless,\" witness Taylor Benge said. \"From there on ... people just started dropping like flies.\" Alexandria Cheplak, 25, called her father as she ran from the bullets. \"Everyone's dying around me,\" Jon Cheplak recalled her saying. \"Everyone's dying. They shot my friend ... I've got to get out of here.\" The gunman, identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, unleashed a hail of bullets from the 32nd floor of the nearby Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said Monday. But why the massacre happened remains a mystery. \"I can't get into the mind of a psychopath,\" the sheriff said. Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman described the gunman as \"a crazed lunatic full of hate.\" Latest developments -- Police had no prior knowledge of the gunman before the attack, Sheriff Lombardo said. \"I don't know how it could have been prevented,\" he said. -- Paddock bought multiple firearms in the past, but investigators believe the firearms were purchased legally, a law enforcement official said. The official said initial reports suggest at least one rifle was altered to function as an automatic weapon. -- Police found 23 rifles inside Paddock's hotel room, Las Vegas police said. -- 19 additional firearms were recovered from Paddock's home in Mesquite, Nevada. Law enforcement also found explosives, 1,000s of rounds of ammunition and electronic devices. -- Law enforcement executed a search on Paddock's second home in northern Nevada, Lombardo said. Festival turns into massacre The massacre started around 10:08 p.m. Sunday (1:08 a.m. ET Monday) at the Route 91 Harvest festival, Lombardo said. Benge was enjoying the concert with his sister when he heard a relentless onslaught of \"200 to 300\" bullets. \"The firing went on forever,\" witness Kimberly Chilcote said. She and her husband ran in short bursts -- sprinting and hiding to avoid being targeted. \"There were purses and shoes everywhere ... there were bodies and blood,\" she said. \"We just kept running.\" Benge lauded the heroics of his sister, who \"threw herself on top of me and said, 'I love you, Taylor,'\" he said. \"Even after an hour and 30 minutes, I didn't know if I was safe.\" Witness Bryan Hopkins said he survived by jumping into a walk-in freezer at the Mandalay Bay hotel. And country singer Jake Owen, who was on stage with Aldean, said children were among the crowd. \"I saw kids on their parents' shoulders tonight,\" he said. \"This is something they'll never forget.\" The investigation Police said they believe Paddock acted alone. \"Right now, we believe it's a sole actor, a lone-wolf-type actor,\" the sheriff said. So far, the massacre has no known link to overseas terrorism or terror groups, a US official with knowledge of the case said. And a woman who was described as a \"person of interest\" after the attack is now not believed to be involved in the shooting, police said in a statement. \"Marilou Danley is no longer being sought out as a person of interest,\" the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said. \"LVMPD detectives have made contact with her and do not believe she is involved with the shooting on the strip.\" The gunman's brother, Eric Paddock, said he was stunned to learn Stephen was responsible for the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. \"We're still just completely befuddled. Dumbstruck,\" Eric Paddock said outside his home in Orlando, Florida. He described his brother, a retired accountant, as \"a wealthy guy. He liked to play video poker. He went on cruises.\" The last time Eric Paddock spoke to his brother was when Stephen texted him, asking how their mother was doing after losing power from Hurricane Irma. Eric Paddock said he knew his brother owned a few handguns and maybe one long rifle, but said he did not know of any automatic weapons. Blood donations needed With hundreds of victims still hospitalized, officials feared the death toll will keep rising. The sheriff implored the community to donate blood. And before dawn Monday, throngs of donors had already lined up outside a blood bank. Shanda Maloney tweeted a photo while she stood in line at 4:30 a.m. \"This. Is. Vegas. This is our community. These are our people. Thank you to everyone here donating,\" she tweeted. Maloney told CNN she also gave transportation to anyone who needed it after the attack. \"I just started picking people up and giving people rides,\" she says. Aldean speaks out Aldean posted a statement on Instagram saying that he and his crew were safe. \"My Thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved tonight. It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night. #heartbroken#stopthehate,\" he wrote. Two Las Vegas police officers are being treated at a hospital after they were injured during the shooting, Lombardo said. One is in critical condition, and the other had minor injuries. \"Pray for Las Vegas,\" Mayor Goodman tweeted. \"Thank you to all our first responders out there now.\" Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval said on Twitter that a \"tragic  ; heinous act of violence has shaken the #Nevada family\" and offered prayers to all those affected by \"this act of cowardice.\" 'We just ran for our lives' Rachel De Kerf filmed her escape from the venue using her cell phone, starting just after the first shots were fired. She described ongoing gunfire, and played out the video she had recorded during which more than five minutes of gunfire were intermittently audible. \"The gunshots lasted for 10-15 minutes. It didn't stop,\" she said. \"We just ran for our lives.\" De Kerf's sister, Monique Dumas, said that everyone instantly crouched when they heard the shots. \"The band was rushed off the stage, the floodlights came on the crowd, and you see on the right hand of the stage the person who was injured, so they're calling for medics, calling for security, then there was gunfire again,\" Dumas said. 'Go, go, go' SiriusXM Country radio host Storme Warren was on the side of the stage as Aldean was performing when the shots rang out. \"I thought it was fireworks going off and maybe it mistriggered, and then it happened again. And when it happened the third time, we knew something was wrong,\" Warren said. \"The shells were hitting the deck of the stage when I was on it,\" he said, adding that he could still hear the shells as he went under the stage for protection. \"It seemed there was a pause in the gunfire and the people in the yellow shirts were telling the people to 'go, go, go, go' ... the gunfire never ended, it seemed like it went on and on and on,\" Dumas said. A concertgoer told CNN affiliate KLAS that everybody was lying on top of each other trying to get out of the shooter's way. \"My husband and I ran out toward our car, and there were people hiding underneath my car for cover,\" she said. \"There was a gentleman who was shot and he said, 'Can you help me?' And so I put him in my car and I had like six people in my car, people without shoes, running, just to get away.\" 'Like shooting fish in a barrel' Audio of the shooting suggested that the shooter had used a military-style weapon, CNN law enforcement analyst James Gagliano said. \"Automatic weapon(s) like that -- had to be numbers of magazines or a very large drum, it sounded to me like a belt-fed weapon, a military-style weapon and then to be shooting down, to use the analogy, it was like shooting fish in a barrel in that space,\" Gagliano said. MGM Resorts, which owns the Mandalay Bay, tweeted its condolences. \"Law enforcement and emergency personnel responded quickly to the incident and secured the scene,\" it said in a statement. \"Law enforcement requested that we put hotels in the vicinity on lockdown to ensure guest safety. We will provide more information as it becomes available.\" Later, Lombardo said guests at Mandalay Bay could return to their rooms. Police had completed the search of Paddock's room at the resort, he said. Those looking for information about loved ones still missing after the attack can call 866-535-5654. And Facebook has set up a crisis response page to help people determine whether their loved ones are safe. The-CNN-Wire \u2122  ; \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

{"text":"Bill O\u2019Reilly Uses Anti-Semitic Dog Whistles Against George Soros To Hit Media Matters: Bill O\u2019Reilly sank to new lows last night when he attacked liberal philanthropist George Soros with anti-Semitic dog whistles. O'Reilly called Soros \u201cthe shadow puppet master behind corrupt far-left groups like Media Matters\u201d and said he \u201chas his tentacles into political organizations.\u201d This, as Media Matters has been hammering O\u2019Reilly over his many fabrications that have been uncovered recently. But first, O\u2019Reilly used another, racial dog whistle to suggest President Obama is an uber welfare queen. It all happened in O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Talking Points commentary last night. It purported to be about the \u201cBlockupy\u201d protests in Frankfurt, Germany. Or, as O\u2019Reilly said, \u201canti-capitalist violence on display.\u201d But as with just about any subject on Fox, it wasn\u2019t long before O\u2019Reilly exploited this news story to go after Democrats. First, Obama:  O'REILLY: And it all comes back to the same thing: private enterprise being strangled by big government spending and regulations. Entitlements, free stuff, giving people the means to live\u2014giving it to them, rather than having them earn their way. Here in America, President Obama is sympathetic to the big government economic intrusion.  Then Soros - after a swipe at Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders:  O'REILLY: We do have a quasi-socialistic senator in Elizabeth Warren, who if Hillary Clinton goes down, could compete in the Democratic sweepstakes for president. We also have Senator Bernie Sanders, a socialist, who Vermont voters have elected ten times. But the most frightening of all is this man, George Soros, billionaire who made huge money trading currencies rooting for countries to fail. Soros has now taken his ill-gotten gains and is financing the most radical left-wing organizations in America. He is a shadow puppet master behind corrupt far-left groups like Media Matters. Soros has his tentacles into political organizations like the Center for American Progress which has provided operatives for the Obama administration, some of whom are now going over to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Few Americans even know who Soros is, but the 84-year-old uber leftist is behind much of the political strife in this country. So let\u2019s be clear. When a bank opening in Frankfurt, Germany causes injury to nearly 100 police officers and millions of dollars worth of damage, there is a problem. We Americans have to wake up and counter the problem.  This is nothing short of disgusting. It\u2019s also reminiscent of Glenn Beck\u2019s rhetoric. The same rhetoric that prompted 400 rabbis to write a letter of complaint to Fox News calling it \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cbeyond repugnant.\u201d As Media Matters explains, O'Reilly (like Beck) adopted Nazi rhetoric:  Depictions of Jewish people as \u201c puppet masters\u201d controlling the government and the media are anti-Semitic stereotypes that go back decades. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s claim that Soros\u2019 \u201ctentacles\u201d have infiltrated the upper echelons of political society is also a play on overtly anti-Semitic imagery. The white supremacist, neo-Nazi online forum Stormfront.org contains a trove of examples, including a March 19, 2013 post called \u201cThe 6 Tentacles of Jewish Supremacy Revealed.\u201d The image of a Jewish octopus engulfing the globe or ensnaring political institutions dates back to at least the 1930s, when it was a common theme in Nazi propaganda.  The timing of this dirty viciousness is suspicious. In recent weeks, Media Matters has published nearly 50 posts (by my count) about O\u2019Reilly\u2019s fabrications since Mother Jones first raised the issue in its February 19th article questioning O\u2019Reilly\u2019s accounts of reporting on the Falklands war in Argentina. Rather than answer the still-open questions about his veracity, O\u2019Reilly resorts to ethnic smears. Watch it below, from last night's The O'Reilly Factor.","label":1}
{"text":"Fox\u2019s Earhardt: Trump\u2019s Tweets Prove He\u2019s Perfect For Dealing With N. Korea And Russia: Fox  ; Friends ignored the gift to Vladimir Putin that Donald Trump offered up during his press conference in Poland today. Instead cohost Ainsley Earhardt argued that Trump's attacks on American media make him \"the kind of guy you're going to want\" going up against North Korea and Putin. We can just imagine the Fox  ; Friends poutrage we\u2019d have seen this morning if President Barack Obama attacked Fox News, our intelligence agencies and former President George W. Bush on foreign soil. But since it was Dear Leader Donald Trump attacking CNN, MSNBC, the intelligence community and Obama, it was all part of presidential Awesomeness! During his press conference in Poland, Trump made childish, vindictive and narcissistic comments when asked about his Tweeted gif showing him \u201cwrestling\u201d CNN:  TRUMP: I think what CNN did was unfortunate for them. As you know, they have some pretty serious problems. They have been fake news for a long time. They have been covering me in a very, very dishonest way. [\u2026] NBC is equally as bad, despite the fact that I made \u2018em a fortune with The Apprentice, but they forgot that.  I\u2019m old enough to remember when Fox accused Obama of not loving America. But with Trump in the White House, it's America's fault! After Trump attacked two large American media companies on foreign soil, cohost Ainsley Earhardt scolded the reporter for asking the question.  EARHARDT: It\u2019s interesting, after a 15 minute press conference, the reporter stands up, and the first question is about North Korea and he coupled that with that CNN question about the wrestling video. It\u2019s like, come on, can we talk about the issues?  On Fox, \u201ctalking about the issues\u201d means praising Trump more substantively. So Kilmeade jumped in to argue that the Tweet was no reflection on Trump\u2019s Awesome Things-That-Matter Awesomeness.  KILMEADE: I know you guys have thought about this, but hopefully people at home have put this together. I know the president comes out and he puts out these videos and people think, \u201cthat\u2019s unpresidential\u201d or \u201cthis is not right\u201d or \u201cthis is different, why is he tweeting that?\u201d But in the big picture, when things matter, when it comes to international security and world war, like North Korea, when it comes to relations with Russia, when it comes to the Middle East and Syria and ISIS, he is cool and calculated like a 40-year diplomatic veteran. Look at North Korea. We might have to take some very tough action against North Korea. He isn\u2019t saying, \u201cThis little clown has no right doing this, he was given\u201d\u2014he\u2019s being very cool and calculated and very\u2014and parses his speech because he knows the impact. [Transcript excerpt via Media Matters]  But that wasn\u2019t quite enough Trump Awesomeness for Earhardt. She suggested that Trump\u2019s Tweets were an integral part of Dear Leader\u2019s Magnificence:  EARHARDT: Well, the very reason that the left doesn\u2019t like him is because he\u2019s not going to be intimidated. He will put these videos out there to say this is fake news. Yet, that\u2019s the kind of guy that you\u2019re going to want to represent the United States of America when he does have to come up against North Korea, when he does have to have talks tomorrow with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. [Transcript excerpt via Media Matters]  Then cohost Steve Doocy played the clip that contained Trump's gift to Putin. It was in response to NBC\u2019s Hallie Jackson asking Trump if he would \u201cdefinitively say that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.\u201d Trump\u2019s answer was mind boggling. First, he equivocated, saying he thinks it was Russia but \u201cit could have been\u201d other countries, which undoubtedly pleased Putin at the same time that it undercut our own intelligence agencies. Trump also falsely claimed Obama \u201cdid nothing\u201d about the Russia interference - which Trump had just refused to definitively acknowledge. So how did the Curvy Couch Cheerleaders respond? First, by showing a large banner that said, \u201cTHE MEDIA\u2019S RUSSIAN OBSESSION.\u201d Then cohost Doocy said contemptuously that Jackson had tried to ask a third question, despite the rules only allowing two. \u201cTime ran out,\u201d he sneered. Then Doocy changed the subject. Watch Fox News sell out the United States in favor of Trump below, from the July 6, 2017 Fox  ; Friends.","label":1}

Soap manufacturers Dove have issued an apology on Twitter and Facebook after a blatantly racist Facebook advert went viral and became the target of justified consumer rage this weekend. The advert was released on Saturday (October 7) and showed a static compilation of four photos. The first frame shows a black woman in a bathroom with a bottle of Dove body wash in the corner. The frames then show the woman reach down, lift her shift off to reveal a smiling white woman.

{"text":"FBI is investigating the Clinton Foundation: The FBI has been quietly investigating the Clinton Foundation for months, reviving a probe that was dialed back during the 2016 election amid tensions between Justice Department prosecutors and FBI agents about the politically charged case, according to people familiar with the matter. The investigation is being run out of the FBI\u2019s field office in Little Rock, Arkansas, where the foundation has offices in the William J. Clinton Presidential Center, the people said. Agents are trying to determine if any donations made to the foundation were linked to official acts when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, these people said. It was not immediately clear what specific donations or interactions agents were scrutinizing, and there was some skepticism inside both the Justice Department and the FBI that the case would ultimately lead to any charges. The very existence of such a probe will likely lead to accusations from Democrats that the Republican administration is pursuing old, dead cases to punish political enemies. President Donald Trump has repeatedly urged the Justice Department to prosecute Clinton and her aides. But while the Clinton Foundation investigation was effectively stopped in 2016, that stoppage at the time was described by people familiar with the matter as temporary because Justice Department officials were concerned that if details of the probe were to become public, it would appear that investigators were trying to hurt Clinton\u2019s chances in the election. In a statement, Clinton Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian said: \u201cTime after time, the Clinton Foundation has been subjected to politically motivated allegations, and time after time these allegations have been proven false. None of this has made us waver in our mission to help people. The Clinton Foundation has demonstrably improved the lives of millions of people across America and around the world while earning top ratings from charity watchdog groups in the process. There are real issues in our society needing attention that the Clinton Foundation works hard to solve every day. So we\u2019re going to stay focused on what really matters.\u201d Republicans, in particular, have long raised concerns about what they viewed as corruption and conflicts of interest at the Clinton Foundation, in particular Hillary Clinton\u2019s dealings with its donors while she was secretary of state. The Clinton Foundation probe dates back to 2015, when FBI agents in Los Angeles, New York, Little Rock and Washington, began looking at a variety of different figures who had made donations to the charity, based largely on news accounts, according to people familiar with the matter. In 2016, Justice Department prosecutors rejected a request from FBI agents to expand and intensify the foundation investigation, these people said. Republican lawmakers had called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions in July and again in September to explore various Clinton Foundation dealings, as well as other matters, by appointing a special counsel to look into Clinton-related issues. In November, the Justice Department wrote that Sessions would direct senior prosecutors to look into the cases about which they raised concerns and hinted that some might already be under investigation. Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote that part of what the department would do was assess whether \u201cany matters currently under investigation require further resources,\u201d though he said his letter should not be construed as confirming or denying any probe. By that time, according to the people familiar with the matter, agents were already investigating the Clinton Foundation. The Clinton Foundation inquiry is separate from the FBI\u2019s high-profile investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, though Republicans have said that probe, too, needs to be reopened. The email investigation focused on whether Clinton or her aides mishandled classified information by using the private server. Then-FBI Director James Comey recommended in July 2016 the case be closed without charges, and though work on it briefly resumed in October - soon before the presidential election - he ultimately did not change his mind, and the Justice Department endorsed his recommendation. Justice Department officials have said senior prosecutors are also reviewing investigative records on the Clinton email case to see if any of the concerns raised by Republican lawmakers merit appointment of a special counsel for further investigation. The Clinton Foundation has raised billions of dollars since it was formed and generally receives high marks from philanthropy watchdog organizations. But, because of its global donor base and Hillary Clinton\u2019s former position as America\u2019s top diplomat, it also faced questions about contributions from countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Algeria.","label":0}

They are all labeled \u201cgreat men\u201d in their own right if you are looking merely at influence, power and wealth. But they are shameful icons of the treatment of women. Many of us are secretly hoping for a political thread through these names, a denominator that we can wave and shove in the faces of our opposition. The latest newsmaker, Harvey Weinstein was a generous donor to causes and especially to Democratic candidates. But this isn\u2019t a political story. This is a human story. We need to quit idolizing the men who do this, looking the other way, and ignoring this kind of behavior. As men, we need to defend our women. This is both a human imperative and a godly calling. The revelations of one of Hollywood\u2019s main power brokers using his influence to manipulate women is rolling through the ranks of the elite. Harvey Weinstein producer is now Harvey Weinstein the predator. Suddenly the once popular star-maker is persona non-grata. He has spent most of his life surrounded by stars, media and the limelight. Now he juggles lawyers, public relations firms, and handlers hoping for a break from the bad news that just won\u2019t stop. Over the coming weeks more women will no doubt step forward. Emboldened by the voices of others, they will have the courage to say that yes, they too were victims. We saw this with Bill Cosby, America\u2019s dad. The man who made us laugh. The man who broke down so many racial divides. The man who seemed so genuine. He was a fraud, drugging dozens of womenthroughout the years, using his aw shucks nature to lure women to his bed. And Bill O\u2019Reilly, the top rated cable show host and firebrand of conservatives was fired after a half dozen women came forward claiming sexual harassment. No matter how true his opinions might be in your mind, you cannot escape the fact that his \u201ctalking points memo\u201d left off a few vital details. Another Bill \u2013 Clinton \u2013 had more than his share of dalliances. At least three women accused him of unwanted sexual advances. Another five, including White House intern Monica Lewinsky, said they had had consensual affairs with him. Clinton was impeached on charges of lying about the Lewinsky affair before a grand jury and of obstruction of justice. And still women\u2019s groups fawn over him, his charm and appeal to their causes. And our current president, Donald Trump, has also used his position, fame and money to lure in women. Unlike some of the others, his has been less hidden, as he has openly called women names, demeaning them in one comment and action after another. Yet men and women both are forgetting all of that as long as America is \u201cgreat again.\u201d Can we really separate the man from the method?  Photo by Jorge Flores via CCLI Unsplash You see, there is no politics when it comes to this kind of abuse. It crosses all lines. We so desperately want to shine the light on this kind of behavior and make it a \u201cleft-right\u201d issue, but we can\u2019t. It\u2019s a \u201cWrong\u201d issue. In all of these cases, I think it\u2019s impossible to stand for the man when they won\u2019t stand for the women in their life. How many of us voted for Bill Clinton or Donald Trump, knowing this was going on behind the scenes. \u201cI don\u2019t condone that behavior, but I sure like their political stands.\u201d We can\u2019t applaud the art, laugh at the jokes, pay for the entertainment. None of this is cute. None of this is excusable. Especially for those of us who claim Christ to be our King. Jesus was a prominent defender of women\u2019s rights in his culture. Don\u2019t believe me? Read it for yourself. His interactions with women were culture tweaking. He spoke to them openly and as equals. A former prostitute was given full equality. He treated his mother with tenderness. His most amazing miracle, his resurrection, was first told to women who had the privilege to be the first to spread the news. Of all the major faiths, Christianty teaches men to treat women as God sees them. Jesus broke all the rules of the day. He forbade the hierarchy of the day, giving equality to all men\u2026and women. He went to the cross for women \u2014 our daughters, our wives, our mothers, our sisters. I am stunned that major political parties and even women\u2019s rights groups promote and defend Islam, which demeans women to the core. Many groups were applauding Saudi Arabia\u2019s recent decision to allow their women to drive. \u201cHow progressive!\u201d Can we drop our politics, just for a moment, to talk about our shared humanity? Every woman, no matter how strong and independent she is, admires the man who will stand up to defend the honor, the femininity, and the uniqueness of the woman in his life. Today, I see all kinds of men willing to stand up for the flag, but will we stand up for our women?","label":1}

{"text":"IL Man Gets $15,000 Plus Attorneys\u2019 Fees After July 4 Arrest for Burning Flag: On July 4, 2016, a day on which we\u2019re supposed to celebrate our freedoms, 22-year-old Bryton Mellott of Urbana, Illinois spent the morning in jail because he had desecrated an American flag and posted the image on Facebook:  Along with the image, Mellott wrote this:  I am not proud to be an American. In this moment, being proud of my country is to ignore the atrocities committed against people of color, people living in poverty, people who identify as women, and against my own queer community on a daily basis\u2026  It didn\u2019t matter whether or not you agree with his actions. The flag is merely a symbol, and burning it is perfectly legal. In 1989, the Supreme Court even banned any statutes that punished people for doing that. (Interesting trivia: Justice Antonin Scalia was in the 5-4 majority defending free speech. Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor was on the other side.) Mellott was charged with flag desecration, which is still on the books as a punishable offense under Illinois law, but it\u2019s a law that\u2019s unenforceable. The official line from the police was that Mellott wasn\u2019t arrested and detained for burning the flag but rather (in the ACLU\u2019s words) to \u201censure his own personal safety.\u201d Earlier this year, Mellott, with the help of the ACLU of Illinois, announced that he had filed a federal lawsuit against the people involved in his arrest. His ultimate goal was to declare the flag desecration law unconstitutional:  \u201cI hold the opinion that open dissent is the highest form of American patriotism;\u201d Mr. Mellott said in prepared remarks announcing the lawsuit. \u201cIt was a frightening display of irony that on the Fourth of July, I should be taken from my workplace to sit in a county jail for exercising this liberty.\u201d \u2026 \u201cThere simply was no justification for Bryton to be arrested for his political statement,\u201d said Rebecca Glenberg, ACLU of Illinois senior staff attorney. \u201cIf police were concerned about Bryton\u2019s safety, they should have taken action against whomever they thought was compromising his safety, not against the person engaged in constitutionally protected speech.\u201d \u201cWe are asking the court to strike down the Illinois law to ensure that law enforcement in Urbana and across Illinois know that this statute cannot be enforced.\u201d added Glenberg.  Both sides have now settled the case, but the compromise is decidedly in Mellott\u2019s favor. He\u2019ll get $15,000 along with an additional $20,000 for attorneys\u2019 fees. The downside is that the statute against flag desecration, which is still unenforceable, remains on the books.  The Urbana Police Department and the officers\u2019 attorney were unavailable for comment Monday after the announcement of the settlement. The defendants named were officers Kenneth Sprague, Jeremy Hale, Matthew McElhoe and Andrew Charles. \u2026 In a statement, Mellott said he was pleased with [Judge Colin] Bruce\u2019s ruling that his actions were protected. \u201cWhile this is a fact the police department should have known already, I certainly hope that they have learned from their mistake,\u201d he said.  I hope they have, too. What those officers did was wrong, and it\u2019s appalling they didn\u2019t realize their mistake that day. The officers should have admitted their stupidity and apologized for what they did. Instead, it took an arrest and a lawsuit to get thousands of dollars and no comment.

{"text":"NRA Sponsored Domestic Terrorist Kills Over 50 In Las Vegas Shooting: With the help of the NRA, America\u2019s premier terrorist organization, a white man kills over 50 and wounds over 500 in Las Vegas shooting. Another day, another senseless gun tragedy in America, brought to you by the National Rifle Association, America\u2019s premier terrorist organization. On Sunday, Stephen Paddock, 64, committed the worst mass shooting in recent U.S. history. Paddock fired from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel, killing over 50 and wounding over 500 before taking his own life. At least 10 rifles were found in Paddock\u2019s room, because in America, the NRA make sure every domestic terrorist has easy access to firearms. In fact, the NRA is a deplorable terrorist organization that hides behind the second amendment and the interests of a small but vocal and threatening minority, while putting the vast majority of decent Americans in harm\u2019s way.  1.4 million Americans have died from gunfire since 1968, more than in all of the country\u2019s wars through history combined. No other group \u2014 not ISIS, not Al Qaeda, not foreign governments \u2014 has been more successful at killing Americans than the NRA.  And:  It is impossible to determine the exact number of deaths that can be directly attributed to the NRA\u2019s efforts, because for 20 years, it has successfully fought to prevent any public health studies at the federal level into gun violence.  Market Watch reports that contrary to public opinion, the NRA does not speak for all gun owners, and only a small, deranged minority of gun owners are actually NRA members:  Only a tiny percentage of Americans are members of the NRA. The association\u2019s annual membership fee is $40. Last year its membership dues came to $160 million. So that\u2019s 4 million members. Out of an estimated 55 million gun owners.  Yet despite the relatively small numbers, the NRA terrorizes politicians and civilians alike. Commenting on the Las Vegas shooting via Twitter, 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton declared that it is time for politicians to stand up to the terrorist organization known as the NRA:  Our grief isn\u2019t enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again.  Clinton is right. As a nation we live with and tolerate a culture of gun violence. All the while any proposal to enact sensible reform to curb gun violence is squashed by the the NRA as they intimidate and bully politicians, while spreading deception and misinformation to the general public. They are the equivalent of the 20th century tobacco lobby, merchants of death, claiming their product is safe while countless Americans die. The logic of guns in America is a curious and disturbing example of a collective conceptual confusion, fueled by irrational fears and misinformation distributed by the domestic terrorist organization known as the NRA. The country is made numb by the horrors involving guns that happen day after day, year after year, while politicians are held hostage by the NRA. Also commenting on the Las Vegas shooting, comedian Michael Ian Black notes:  The NRA is a terrorist organization. There\u2019s no other way to say it.  And this tweet via leading scientist and atheist Richard Dawkins:  Durn tootin\u2019, great shootin\u2019. Cool dude sertin\u2019 he\u2019s 2nd Mendment rahts. Hell yeah!

{"text":"American-born Muslims more likely than Muslim immigrants to see negatives in U.S. society: While Muslims born in the United States and their immigrant counterparts share a pride in being American, U.S.-born Muslims are less likely than immigrants to feel comfortable with their place in broader American society. Muslim immigrants and those born in the U.S. both overwhelmingly express pride in their national identity. About nine-in-ten U.S.-born (90%) and foreign-born (93%) Muslims say they are proud to be American, according to a 2017 Pew Research Center survey.  Like the larger American public, majorities of both U.S.-born Muslims and Muslim American immigrants say they believe people who want to get ahead can do so with hard work (65% and 73% respectively). Roughly six-in-ten of all Americans (62%) share this belief. However, U.S.-born Muslim Americans are less likely than immigrants to perceive positive feelings from their fellow Americans. Indeed, just three-in-ten U.S.-born Muslims say the American people are friendly toward Muslim Americans, compared to 73% of immigrants who feel this way.   And U.S.-born Muslims are more likely than their immigrant counterparts to say there is discrimination against Muslims, and to say they have personally experienced at least one of several specific types of discrimination, such as people acting suspicious of them or calling them offensive names, being singled out by airport security or by some other law enforcement, or being physically attacked or threatened. Nine-in-ten (91%) U.S.-born Muslims say there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims, compared with 65% of immigrants who say this. And six-in-ten U.S.-born Muslims (61%) say that in the past 12 months they have experienced at least one of the specific types of discriminatory behavior asked about in the survey, compared with 39% of immigrants who say this. As might be expected, those who have personally experienced discrimination are more likely to say that there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims. U.S.-born Muslims also are more likely than immigrants to say that political institutions are unfriendly toward their group. For instance, most U.S.-born and foreign-born Muslims say the Democratic Party is \u201cfriendly\u201d or \u201cneutral\u201d toward Muslim Americans, but immigrant Muslims are particularly likely to feel this way. Likewise, U.S.-born Muslims are more likely to say the Democratic Party is unfriendly (23%) than foreign-born Muslims (5%). And while many U.S. Muslims say that the Republican Party is unfriendly toward Muslim Americans, seven-in-ten U.S.-born Muslims hold this view, while only half of foreign-born Muslims say this. The same holds for views on President Trump. Large majorities of U.S. Muslims say that Trump is unfriendly toward Muslims, but U.S.-born Muslims are more likely to hold this view (85% vs. 67%).

{"text":"The biggest moments of racism in 2017 | Solomon Jones: Steve Helber \/ AP In August 2017, white nationalist demonstrators walked into the entrance of Lee Park surrounded by counter demonstrators in Charlottesville, Va. The rally erupted in violence, killing Heather Heyer. It was one of the most racist moments of the year, says columnist Solomon Jones. In 2017, racism not only won the day. It won the year. That\u2019s my takeaway from a 12-month span that saw America inaugurate a president who ran on a hate-filled platform that denigrated and demeaned anyone who was not a white male. Some would say that another -ism \u2014 sexism \u2014 was the watchword for 2017. But I would argue that the much-needed #MeToo movement, which finally began the process of rightly punishing sexual predators, was the mirror we needed. It showed us that while sexism will be punished going forward, racism will remain the status quo. For those who doubt the veracity of that statement, I offer you the four biggest moments in racism from the year 2017. 1. The inauguration of Donald Trump President Trump walks with first lady Melania Trump during the inauguration parade. The January ceremony was the crowning achievement of a candidate who replaced the veiled racism of past presidential hopefuls with the overt bigotry of a man who doesn\u2019t give a damn. Trump understood the racial resentment that many Americans harbored after eight years under Barack Obama, America\u2019s first black president, and Trump used it to his advantage. Having benefited from five years of peddling the racist lie that Obama was born in Kenya and therefore unqualified to be president, Trump repeatedly returned to the well of racism. Trump asserted that undocumented Mexican immigrants were rapists and criminals. Trump proposed that Muslims \u2014 most of whom are black and brown \u2014 should be banned from the United States. Trump said a judge presiding over a lawsuit against Trump\u2019s company could not rule fairly because of the judge\u2019s Mexican heritage, prompting House Speaker Paul Ryan to say, \u201c Claiming a person can\u2019t do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment.\u201d But Ryan still backed Trump for president, as did the vast majority of the GOP. That\u2019s what led to the inauguration of Donald Trump, and paved the way for the normalization of racism. 2. The travel ban People carry posters during a rally in Times Square. The rally was held in support of American Muslims and against President Trump\u2019s executive order banning travel from seven Muslim-majority nations. In January, shortly after his inauguration, Trump penned an executive order that he said was focused on keeping America safe from terrorists. But many, including myself, saw it as an attempt to implement Trump\u2019s ban on Muslims entering the country. The ban initially applied to travelers from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. It also permanently banned refugees from Syria. For those keeping score, these countries are primarily composed of black and brown people. And none of these countries is Chechnya, home to the white Muslims who carried out the Boston Marathon bombing. After various court battles over the ban, the Trump administration fashioned a third version that included North Korea and Venezuela \u2014 two non-Muslim countries. The Supreme Court then allowed the travel ban to be implemented while court challenges continue. That, my friends, tells everyone who\u2019s watching that in the eyes of America, terrorists are only black and brown people who practice certain religions. They\u2019re not white guys who shoot hundreds of people from a hotel room in Las Vegas. 3. The rise of the (In)justice Department Attorney General Jeff Sessions addresses the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference at the Philadelphia Convention Center. Nothing says racism like a Justice Department decision to \u201creview\u201d consent decrees calling on police departments to change their patterns of abusing black people. But in April, Jeff Sessions, the former Alabama senator who is now the U.S. attorney general, saw no problem with essentially shelving the Justice Department agreements made with 14 abusive police departments under the Obama administration. At the time, Sessions told a conservative radio host that consent decrees can \u201c reduce the morale of the police officers.\u201d That\u2019s an interesting viewpoint. Here\u2019s mine: Nothing lowers morale more than being shot dead by a police officer because your skin color was perceived as a threat. 4. Charlottesville A photo of Heather Heyer rests among a makeshift memorial in Charlottesville, Va. Heyer was struck and killed by a car while protesting a white nationalist rally in August. When thousands of neo-Nazis and white supremacists gathered to protest the removal of a Confederate monumentfrom a liberal college town in Virginia, it was the culmination of Donald Trump\u2019s quest to normalize racism. Can you imagine a large-scale march of white supremacists taking place in 2007, or 1997? How about 1987? Neither can I. Nor can I imagine the president of the United States saying both sides are to blame when violence erupts from such a march, yet that\u2019s what Donald Trump said in 2017 \u2014 the year that race relations went backward. Trump said anti-racism protesters were partly to blame for the Charlottesville violence even after 32-year-old Heather Heyer was killed. She died when reputed neo-Nazi sympathizer James Fields, 20, allegedly drove his car into a crowd of anti-racism protesters. Fields was subsequently charged with first-degree murder in Heyer\u2019s death. The fact that Heyer was a white woman is significant, because her willingness to stand up against white supremacists tells an irrefutable truth: Not everyone is a racist. And that fact, more than anything else I saw in 2017, gives me hope. It tells me that perhaps things can change as America drags the heavy weight of racism into a new year.

{"text":"Advice issued in wake of Las Vegas attack: See all 2 photos YOUNGSTERS are being reminded what to do if caught up in a terrorist attack in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting. The mass shooting at the Mandalay Bay Hotel left 59 people dead and another 527 injured. Police are still working to establish the motive behind the attack despite Islamic State having claimed responsibility. Gunman Stephen Paddock, aged 64, opened fire from from a 32nd floor window of the hotel towards the open-air country music festival. Last week, Counter Terrorism Police in the UK launched a new safety campaign directed at 11 to 16-year-olds, teaching them what to do if they are caught in a gun or knife terror attack. Advice includes not to stop and use their phone until they are safely away from danger. The campaign is using celebrities, including TV star Bear Grylls and England footballer Jamie Vardy, to try and get the message across. The UK terror level is still at severe and the advice to children is to run if they are able to do so, hide if they are not and to tell the police of the threat only when it is safe to do so. Children are also being advised to warn others about an ongoing threat and not to stop and use their phones until they are safely away from danger. Previous counter terrorism campaigns have been directed at adults but new age-appropriate safety advice is now being given out to engage with young people. The NSPCC, Childline and Educate against Hate has team up with the National Counter Terrorism Security Office to help and support parents. The campaign was launched following the Manchester Arena bombing, where children were targeted, and attacks in London. National lead for protective security, deputy assistant commissioner Lucy D\u2019Orsi, said: \u201cWe appreciate that talking to young people about terrorism can be scary, for parents and children alike. \u201cBut the atrocities in London and Manchester have sadly resulted in some of the youngest victims of terror this country has ever seen, and if we are able to teach children to act in a way which could potentially save their lives then it is our responsibility to do so. \u201cWe are particularly concerned when we see people \u2013 young and old \u2013 using their mobiles to film scenes when they should be moving away from the danger. The recent incident in Parsons Green is a good example of this. \u201cOur research showed that many young people think filming would be a good thing to provide evidence for police. We must get them to understand that the priority must be their safety.\u201d Later phases of the campaign will launch the messaging at youth groups such as the Scouts, Guides and Cadets.","label":0}

{"text":"Intimidating on Obamacare: The Wall Street Journal has an important editorial noting that some of the emails released earlier this week admitted exactly what we\u2019ve known all along: that the Obama White House orchestrated a campaign to bully the Supreme Court into upholding Obamacare in 2012. After all, why let the law stand in the way of a good plan to politicize the Court?  This week\u2019s leaks show Hillary Clinton ally Neera Tanden laying out a strategy to intimidate the Supreme Court to uphold ObamaCare. Ms. Tanden runs the Center for American Progress, the think tank that is essentially an arm of the Clinton campaign. CAP\u2019s former chief, John Podesta,is now the Clinton campaign chairman, and on June 2, 2015 Ms. Tanden sent an email to Jake Sullivan, a key Clinton aide, copying Mr. Podesta and Jennifer Palmieri, another campaign operative. The subject line was \u201cKing v. Burwell,\u201d the second big legal case contesting the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, three years after the first case in which the Chief sided with the four liberals to uphold the law. Ms. Tanden wrote that, \u201cAs Jennifer will remember, it was pretty critical that the President threw the gauntlet down last time on the Court, warning them in the first case that it would politicize the role of the Court for them to rule against the ACA. As a close reader of the case, I honestly believe that was vital to scaring Roberts off.\u201d  It worked so well the first time that they were considering doing it again in King v. Burwell, this time through Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign:  In her June 2015 email, Ms. Tanden recommended to her Clinton colleagues that they do the same thing again. \u201cI\u2019m not arguing that Hillary spend a lot of time attacking the Court,\u201d she writes. \u201cI do think it would be very helpful to all of our interest in a decision affirming the law, for [Chief Justice] Roberts and perhaps [Justice Anthony] Kennedy to see negative political consequences to ruling against the government. Therefore, I think it would be helpful to have a story of how progressives and Hillary would make the Supreme Court an election issue (which would be a ready argument for liberals) if the Court rules against the government.\u201d      ","label":1}

{"text":"Trump Threatens to Deal Another Blow to the Palestinian Cause: President Trump walks with Palestinian President Abbas at a reception ceremony in Bethlehem, May 23, 2017. (Reuters photo: Mohamad Torokman) By cutting off hundreds of millions in American aid to the Palestinian Authority, the president could radically alter the Middle East. President Trump set off another Twitter firestorm last week when he hinted that he may be considering cutting off hundreds of millions of dollars in annual U.S. aid to the Palestinians. Trump was angered over Palestinian unwillingness to engage in peace talks with Israel after the Trump administration announced the move of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Given that the U.S. channels its Palestinian aid through third-party United Nations organizations, it\u2019s unclear how much money Trump is talking about it. But in total it may exceed $700 million per year, according to reports. A decade ago, the U.S. row with the Palestinian Authority would have been major news. But not now. Why? The entire Middle East has radically changed \u2014 and along with it the role and image of the Palestinians. First, the U.S. is now one of the largest producers of fossil-fuel energy in the world. America is immune from the sort of Arab oil embargo that in 1973\u201374 paralyzed the U.S. economy as punishment for American support of Israel. Even Israel, thanks to new offshore oil and natural-gas discoveries, is self-sufficient in energy and immune from Arab cutoffs. Second, the Middle East is split into all sorts of factions. Iran seeks to spread radical Shiite theocracy throughout Iraq and Syria and into the Persian Gulf states \u2014 and is the greatest supporter of Palestinian armed resistance. The so-called \u201cmoderate\u201d Sunni autocracies despise Iran. Understandably, most Arab countries fear the specter of a nuclear Iran far more than they do the reality of a democratic and nuclear Israel. A third player \u2014 radical Islamic terrorism \u2014 has turned against the Arab status quo as well as the West. Because Palestinian organizations such as Hamas had flirted with Iran and its appendages (such as the terrorists of Hezbollah), they have become less useful to the Arab establishment. The terrorist bloodlettings perpetrated by groups such as the Islamic State and al-Qaeda have discredited terror as a legitimate means to an end in the eyes of the Arab world, despite previous support for Palestinian terrorists. Third, the world itself may have passed the Palestinian issue by. Israel was founded in 1948. Palestinian rhetoric that they would push the Jews into the sea is by now stale. There have been seven decades of failed intifadas and suicide-bombing campaigns, along with full-scale Arab\u2013Israeli wars. Equally futile were endless \u201cpeace processes,\u201d \u201cpeace initiatives,\u201d \u201croad maps,\u201d and \u201cmultiparty talks,\u201d plus Middle East \u201cconferences,\u201d \u201csummits,\u201d and \u201cmemoranda\u201d all over the world, from Madrid and Oslo to Camp David. In the meantime, most other \u201crefugees\u201d the world over have long ago moved on. Around the time Israel was created, some 13 million German speakers were ethnically cleansed from East Prussia and Eastern Europe. The word \u201cPrussia\u201d no longer exists as a geographical or national label. Seven decades later, the grandchildren of refugees do not replay World War II. \u201cPrussians\u201d do not talk about reclaiming their ancestral homelands in present-day Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. German-speaking youth do not demand a \u201cright of return\u201d to their grandparents\u2019 homes to the east. Fourth, the Palestinians have never been able to craft a successful, transparent, consensual government. After 30 years of waiting, the world has mostly given up on their rhetoric of self-government and reform on the West Bank. Since the Palestinian proclamation of independence in 1988, there have been only two \u201cpresidents\u201d: Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas. Neither has allowed open and transparent elections. A Palestinian president gets power by seizing it. He loses it only by dying in office. Over the same period, Israel has elected seven different prime ministers from a variety of political parties. The Palestinian political party Fatah is engaged in a deadly rivalry with the terrorist-inspired Hamas organization that has run Gaza for over a decade. The beef is not over democracy, but over which faction will bury the other. The Palestinians\u2019 inability to rule the West Bank in constitutional fashion is why hundreds of thousands of expatriate Palestinians voice their solidarity from a safe distance while living in North America or Europe. More than a million Palestinians prefer to stay put in Israel. They are convinced that they will have more security, freedom, and prosperity in a democratic state than under dictatorial Palestinian rule a few miles away. Trump may be rash and unfamiliar with the stagnant Middle East peace process, but his political instincts are probably correct. Polls show that less than 20 percent of Americans support the Palestinian cause. Many U.S. citizens are tired of subsidizing those who claim that they do not like their benefactors in the United States. It finally may be time for the Palestinian factions to fund their own causes and go their own ways.

{"text":"Trump Can Fix It: Trump campaigns in Johnstown, Pa., October 21, 2016. (Reuters photo: Jonathan Ernst) It is hard to believe that this clangorous campaign of defamations is in its last week. Of course, in the first year of Donald Trump\u2019s largely self-financed campaign, which broke all records for the sale of silly T-shirts, hats, and badges, his pandering was sometimes outrageous, but it was brilliant. As Senator Marco Rubio said as he bowed out of the race, having been bombed in his home state of Florida by Trump by nearly a million votes, \u201cThere was a tsunami approaching and only Mr. Trump saw it.\u201d The political class that had admitted 12 million illegal immigrants, while waffling about \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d and doing nothing, complacently assumed that the country had acquiesced in this cynical outrage. After all, someone had to do the menial work in the U.S. It was a pandemic of almost terminal hypocrisy and when Donald Trump focused national attention on it, he had to be defamed as a racist. Donald Trump has a big mouth and a loose tongue, but he has, unlike many of his accusers, a perfect record as an equal-opportunity employer, and there is not a scintilla of evidence that he is a racist. He was probably correct that the judge of whom he complained was biased, but was unrigorous and very ungracious in imputing this to his ancestry. Mr. Trump is a great talent, but rigor and grace, like modesty, are not at the forefront of his fine qualities. Not as easily dismissed are Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on several of the free-trade agreements in place or contemplation. He has no problem with Canada as a fair-trading partner of comparable per capita wealth to the United States, and offered the United Kingdom a free-trade deal with minimal negotiations if it does depart the European Union as it has voted to do. What he objects to are free-trade agreements that amount to the importation of unemployment into the United States. There is nothing intellectually wrong with this; the desire of all Americans for cheaper goods and natural resources and agricultural products should be balanced against the interests of the U.S. work force. This is not a euphemism for protectionism that allows uncompetitive American enterprises to milk a tariff-insulated market. This was the greatest and most continuous political issue in the United States from the Civil War to the end of World War II, and Trump does not deserve to be branded as a Luddite guardian of feather-bedding and monopolistic practices. Just as outrageous was the portrayal of Trump as a misogynist. His personal conversation is less coarse than Mrs. Clinton\u2019s, and the tape of his exchange eleven years ago with Billy Bush (of the ubiquitous Bushes), while repulsive, was not how he speaks. He shut Hillary down for months by pointing out that she was an enabler of the most egregious \u201cobjectifier\u201d of women in American presidential history, and her campaign waited until they must have thought it unanswerable to drop this fragmentation grenade. Trump apologized for his comments, and entered the second presidential debate under greater pressure than anyone in the history of these exchanges, going back to Kennedy and Nixon in 1960. His campaign was disintegrating. An inconvenient fact, which the Washington media chose not to recognize, is that he overcame the Bush-tape disaster and won the last two debates; qualities of leadership do lurk beneath his efflorescent egotism. This election has not been so dismal in policy terms. Mrs. Clinton, thanks to the unelected party grandees who are ex officio delegates \u2014 the same people who sandbagged her eight years ago in favor of Obama \u2014 narrowly beat off a cuckoo challenge from a democratic Marxist. Senator Sanders was magnificently correct in excoriating the essentially totalitarian American prosecutorial system, and even in his objections to excessive concessions to Wall Street engineers of the velocity of money, but his general tax policy, neutral-isolationist foreign policy, and trenchant clamping of his lips around the (unnatural) gas-pipe of global warming, made him an implausible candidate. And Donald Trump, while recruiting the blue-collar reactionaries and bringing them back into the political system after decades of sullen abstention, favors universal health care and a generous hand to disadvantaged African Americans. Both candidates have a sane foreign policy, which would steer between the mindless interventionism of George W. Bush and Barack Obama\u2019s Panglossian appeasement of America\u2019s enemies. In England, in the last two weeks, I engaged in three widely publicized debates about the U.S. election. The British public largely clings to the view that the United States is a useful oaf of a country of philistines which occasionally tosses up \u201cone of us\u201d like FDR or JFK, and my audiences had drunk the anti-Trump Kool Aid. I opened each time by predicting that there would not be, because there could not be, any argument for the reelection of the Democrats. Their only campaign has been to smear Trump, whose antics have made him an easy target. Because George H.W. Bush was the only president since Theodore Roosevelt who had sons with an aptitude for politics, and Bill Clinton was the only president since Franklin Roosevelt who had a wife with an aptitude for politics, those two families held one of the three greatest public offices in the country for 32 years from 1981 to 2013, and have handed these positions back and forth between each other. Coincidentally, the last 20 years have been the worst period of presidential misgovernment in the country\u2019s history, surpassing even the twelve years before the Civil War, and between Wilson and FDR. Practically all commentators predicted a race of polemical vehemence unlike any since 1800, when Thomas Jefferson exchanged slanders and libels with John Adams and Alexander Hamilton, and the shadowy maneuverer Aaron Burr almost emerged as president. It was always going to be portrayed as a race between the grotesque caricatures of the Ugly American braggart and materialist and the sleazeball superannuated feminist. When it became clear that Trump had tapped into an electoral geyser (which to me was when he took 49 percent of the minority Republican vote in the arch-liberal state of Massachusetts in a 14-candidate race), and that he would be nominated, it was also clear that he would, in the words of George Wallace nearly 50 years ago, shake the political class \u201cby the eyeteeth.\u201d It is often hard not to adapt to Trump FDR\u2019s comment on his mentor and rival, Alfred E. Smith, that he \u201cloved him for his enemies.\u201d  Trump is the only person who might clean out this Augean stable.  In the end, the majority of Americans could be persuaded not to vote for Trump, as the candidate not complicit in the decline of America these past 20 years, only if they were so horrified by his vulgarity that they overlooked the poor performance of the Bush-Clinton-Obama regency and the ethical frailties of the Democrats. Trump\u2019s offenses are matters of taste, not indictable transgressions, and the revolt of the FBI against the sleazy straddle of Director James Comey\u2019s verbal condemnation of Mrs. Clinton as a perjurer while declining to indict her has blown the race open. Mrs. Clinton has tried to ignore the revelations that her chief aide, Huma Abedin, may have perjured herself, as she has ignored the FBI director\u2019s assertion that she herself lied under oath. She merely \u201cshort-circuited\u201d her FBI interrogators. Rabid partisans like James Carville and Tim Ryan have claimed a conspiracy between the Kremlin, the FBI, Trump, and nameless hobgoblins. It was like Alexander Haig\u2019s conjuration of an \u201cunknown spirit\u201d that erased Rosemary Woods\u2019s Watergate tape in 1973. Trump\u2019s manager, Kellyanne Conway, accurately explained why what has occurred is more odious than Watergate. Richard Nixon, an outstanding president, was crucified, though he never lied under oath and there is no convincing evidence that he personally broke any laws. It is time to write history, including current history, straight. The sadness of Peggy Noonan that the country has been let down by inferior candidates is understandable, but fails to credit Trump for unerringly following a trail no one saw: First he was Archie Bunker, then a lightning rod for excessive abuse, then impresario of the revelation of intolerable ethical strains in the Clinton campaign. Less creditable are the intelligent commentators like Daniel Henninger, who denounced the Hillary Clinton administration as if recounting history, Franklin Pierce or Warren Harding \u2014 implicitly expressing anger that Trump wasn\u2019t a respectable enough Republican candidate to deny the move into the White House of the Clinton pay-to-play casino. And most distasteful of all are the sanctimonious conservative intellectuals who departed Trump to legitimize the Clinton sleaze factory, with the feigned majesty of those who felt entitled to name the Republican candidate, and whose public twitches and reflections were bound to shape the intellectual conscience of America. The friendship of decades with many of them prevents my mentioning names. The worst of them are those who accused Trump of fascistic tendencies and even of anti-Semitism. Everyone upon whom the country had the right to rely has failed: the traditional party elders, the national media, the conservative intellectuals, the engineers and conductors of the great liberal gravy train. In the last week of this tumultuous campaign, Donald Trump, however raucous his delivery, has emerged as the candidate of comparative integrity, and the only person who might clean out the Augean stable of the American political system. Unless Hillary Clinton, whose considerable gifts have never included an excess of spontaneous originality, can pull from the tattered Democratic hat a miraculous Brobdingnagian bunny, the doors of the White House will be opened to the greatest, if far from the most elegant, personal political crusade in American history. \u2014 Conrad Black is the author of Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom, Richard M.

{"text":"First Calais 'Jungle' children arrive in Britain as French prepare to demolish migrant camp: A young migrant claps as he is escorted off a coach by UK Border Force Tory ministers were warned \"the clock is ticking\" today as 14 children came to Britain from Calais Jungle camp. The youngsters are being reunited with their families in Croydon, south London, with more due to come from the ramshackle shanty city later this week. But with the camp being demolished amid fears children will fall into the hands of traffickers and gangs, campaigners accused the government of \"doing the bare minimum\". Lord Dubs, who fled the Nazis to Britain as a child, said there was still no progress over a major victory he won earlier this year. He pushed the government into accepting some stranded children who are already in Europe, not just those from camps near Syria. He warned \"there is still no official process in place\" for those children, adding: \"No child must be left behind in the chaos of demolition.\" Former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Williams warned \"the clock is ticking very fast\" with \"huge urgency\" as winter comes. Speaking of the Dubs Amendment, he said: \"The problem is we haven\u2019t yet seen any process put in place for identifying children who have those needs.\" Lord Williams said taking refugee children is a \"basic moral imperative\". \"It\u2019s a matter of living up to our best selves in this country,\" he added. Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: \"Once again the Government is doing the bare minimum, instead of doing everything it can to help these vulnerable children on our doorstep. \"Charities in Calais have identified hundreds of children who have a legal right to be in the UK.\" Labour MP Angela Eagle added: \"We should have been much faster and much more effective at taking those children.\" The youngsters are understood to have left the port in Northern France this morning and will be reunited with relatives who are already in Britain. The Home Office refused to confirm the number of children coming today or this week, saying it would not give a \"running commentary\". Last week Home Secretary Amber Rudd said taking 300 children from the Jungle would be a good result. Britain is understood to have reunited 140 children with families under the so-called Dublin Regulation so far this year, including 80 from France. A Home Office spokeswoman said: \u201cWe can confirm a group of children who left the Calais camp this morning have arrived in the UK. \u201cThis is the start of the process to transfer as many eligible children as possible before the start of the clearance, as the Home Secretary set out in Parliament. \u201cThese vulnerable children, aged between 14 and 17, were transferred to the UK under the care of Home Office staff, with the support of volunteers from specialist NGOs and charities. They willjoin their families in the UK as quickly as possible over the coming days.\u201d The spokeswoman added: \"Children who are eligible to come to the UK under the Dubs Amendment to the Immigration Act 2016 must be looked after in safe facilities where their best interests are properly considered. \"Work is continuing on both sides of the Channel to ensure this happens as a matter of urgency.\u201d","label":0}

{"text":"Black campaigner Shaun King accused of 'pulling a Rachel Dolezal' after being 'outed as white': (Image: REUTERS \/ Twitter) A prominent black rights campaigner has hit back after being accused of pretending to be mixed race when he is allegedly white, in a case which echoes that of Rachel Dolezal. Black Lives Matter leader Shaun King won a full-ride scholarship intended for black men from Oprah Winfrey to attend college. The 35-year-old is a high profile social activist, campaigning against police brutality towards African Americans, the New York Post reported. King, who says he is the son of a Caucasian mother and an African-American father, has written extensively about racial tensions he experienced while growing up. But an investigative blogger has come forward accusing King of being a fraud and claiming he is actually 100% white, Breitbart reported. Vicki Pate, from the Re-NewsIt blog, claims to have probed King's family tree and alleges that his birth certificate lists his father, Jeffery Wayne King, as being white, not black. His place of birth is reportedly listed as Versailles, Kentucky - where only one Jeffery Wayne King apparently lives in the entire state. Police mugshots following multiple arrests of a man of the same name show he is clearly Causcasian, the blogger claims. King Sr's date of birth matches that shown on Shaun King's birth certificate and Pate even claims brother Russ King, a white man, confirmed the man in the mugshots is their father. King took to Twitter to refute Pate's claims, branding the Breitbart article a \"white supremacist conspiracy\". The case bears striking similarities to that of disgraced race activist Rachel Dolezal. Dolezal, who resigned from the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) after being outed as white, insisted \u201cI identify as black\u201d on US television. She said she had identified as black from the age of five but had the white identity \"thrust\" upon her until she was strong enough to embrace her true self. The 37-year-old carried out her racial charade for years before her estranged parents outed her as white. Dolezal, who alters her appearance to look African-American, told America's Today show she had considered herself black for almost her entire life.","label":0}
{"text":"Families REFUSING to evacuate 'will die' as path of killer Hurricane Matthew is tracked towards Florida: Families are risking their lives by refusing to leave their homes just hours before Hurricane Matthew is due to strike Florida. Residents who are reluctant to evacuate have been told they and their family 'could die' as the killer storm barrels towards the Atlantic coast. Experts have warned the powerful hurricane - which has already killed at least 339 people in Haiti - could cause 'immense human suffering'. Florida Governor Rick Scott told residents who had not evacuated yesterday their 'time is up', with the storm set to bring winds of 120mph. He said: \"To everyone on Florida's east coast, if you are reluctant to evacuate, just think of all the people the Hurricane has already killed. \"You and your family could be among these numbers if you don't take this seriously.\" For live updates on the hurricane, click here. Meanwhile, a Fox News reporter warned viewers that if Matthew moves 20 miles to the west: \"You're going to die. And your kids are going to die too.\" Martin County Sheriff William Snyder also emphasised the strength of the Category 3 hurricane, which has been deemed the biggest storm in a century. He told NBC: \"People do not seem to get it and are not leaving. I'm not saying this to be theatrical ... I asked my captain of detectives if he had body bags because if we get 140mph winds in mobile home parks, we are going to have fatalities.\" Matthew, the first major hurricane threatening a direct hit on the US in more than 10 years, was initially ranked as a Category 4 storm system. It has since been downgraded, but wind gusts of up to 120mph, storm surges and torrential downpours are still set to strike the country. More than three million people have been evacuated from Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina as the hurricane barrels in. The terrifying storm system is currently around 10 miles off the east coast of Florida, but moving north west at speeds of 14mph. It has already claimed the lives of 339, mainly in the Caribbean nation of Haiti. \"We are just bracing and the winds are picking up,\" Daytona Beach Mayor Derrick Henry told CNN early today. He added: \"A great number of our residents have taken heed to our warnings and we are certainly concerned about those that have not.\" More than 140,000 Florida households were left without power due to the severe weather, according to Governor Scott. In West Palm Beach, street lights and houses went dark and Interstate 95 was empty as the storm rolled through the community of 100,000 people. Matthew carried extremely dangerous winds of 130mph as it pounded the northwestern part of the Bahamas en route to Florida's Atlantic coast earlier, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Few storms with winds as powerful as Matthew's have struck Florida, and the NHC warned of 'potentially disastrous impacts'. The U.S. National Weather Service said the storm could be the most powerful to strike northeast Florida in 118 years. Hurricane conditions were expected in parts of Florida today and a dangerous storm surge was expected to reach up to 11 feet along the Florida coast, Ed Rappaport, deputy director of the Miami-based NHC, said on CNN. \"What we know is that most of the lives lost in hurricanes is due to storm surge,\" he said. Some 339 people were killed in Haiti, local officials said, and thousands were displaced after the storm flattened homes, uprooted trees and inundated neighborhoods earlier in the week. Four people were killed in the Dominican Republic, which neighbors Haiti. Damage and potential casualties in the Bahamas were still unclear as the storm passed near the capital, Nassau, yesterday and then out over the western end of Grand Bahama Island. It was too soon to predict where Matthew might do the most damage in the US. However, the NHC's hurricane warning extended up the Atlantic coast from southern Florida through Georgia and into South Carolina. More than 12 million people in the United States were under hurricane watches and warnings, according to the Weather Channel. The last major hurricane, classified as a storm bearing sustained winds of more than 110 mph, to make landfall on U.S. shores was Hurricane Wilma in 2005. Roads in Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina were jammed, and gas stations and food stores ran out of supplies as the storm approached early yesterday. Scott warned there could be 'catastrophic' damage if Matthew slammed directly into the state and urged some 1.5 million people there to evacuate. The Governor activated several thousand National Guard troops to help deal with the storm, while Florida, Georgia and South Carolina opened shelters for evacuees. As of yesterday morning, more than 3,000 people were being housed in 60 shelters in Florida, Scott said. Those three states as well as North Carolina declared states of emergency, empowering their governors to mobilize the National Guard. President Barack Obama called the governors of the four states on Thursday to discuss preparations for the storm. He declared a state of emergency in Florida and South Carolina, a move that authorized federal agencies to coordinate disaster relief efforts. Late Thursday, Obama declared an emergency in Georgia and ordered federal aid to the state. \"Hurricane Matthew is as serious as it gets. Listen to local officials, prepare, take care of each other,\" Obama warned people in the path of the storm in a posting on Twitter. Hundreds of passenger flights were canceled in south Florida, with cancellations expected to spread north along the storm's path.","label":0}
{"text":"Hillary Clinton 'confident' new FBI probe into email scandal will not find cause to file charges: Hillary Clinton says she is confident a new FBI probe into her emails will not change the outcome of the original investigation in July. With just days to go until the US election , the Democratic presidential nominee said people have already made up their minds about the controversy. She called on the FBI to release all new information in its probe of her private email server and said she did not think the agency would change its conclusion in July not to prosecute her. \"The American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately. The director himself has said he doesn't know whether the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not. I'm confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July,\" she told reporters. In a letter to members of Congress, FBI director James Comey revealed new messages have been found that are \"pertinent to the investigation\". In July, FBI officials had recommended that no charges should be brought over the controversy which centres around Ms Clinton's use of a private email server to exchange messages with staff and other officials. Her use of a private email server led many to think she was hiding secret information and putting the nation\u2019s security at risk however she did not face a trial over the allegations. Officials say the emails were discovered after the FBI seized devices belonging to Clinton campaign aide Huma Abedin and her husband Anthony Weiner. He is being investigated after allegedly sending inappropriate messages to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The White House has said it first learned of the decision to re-open the probe in the media \u2013 but that President Obama's view of Ms Clinton has not changed as a candidate. Her campaign chief John Podesta said the announcement's timing was \u201cextraordinary\u201d less than two weeks before the election. He continued: \u201cFBI Director Comey should immediately provide the American public more information than is contained in the letter he sent to eight Republican committee. \"Already, we have seen characterizations that the FBI is \u2018reopening\u2019 an investigation but Comey\u2019s words do not match that characterization. \"Director Comey\u2019s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the Director himself notes they may not even be significant.\u201d Her rival Donald Trump was quick to react to the announcement saying the decision not to lay charges over the emails was a \"grave miscarriage of justice\" and added: \"Perhaps justice will finally be done.\" He said: \"Hillary Clinton\u2019s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office. \"I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made. \"This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood and it is everybody\u2019s hope that it is about to be corrected.\u201d Addressing cheering crowds at a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, he then joked about whether he should continue his speech at all. He said: \"With that being said, the rest of my speech is going to be so boring. Should I even make the speech?\" During the speech he also said the email controversy was \"bigger than Watergate\" \u2013 the 1970s political scandal over a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters that led to the resignation of then-president Richard Nixon. In his letter to Congress, Mr Comey wrote: \"In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton's personal email server. \"Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony. \"In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. \"I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.\" But the new revelations have sparked anger among some members of the Democratic Party who claim Mr Comey has not given enough specifics despite making such a significant announcement just 10 days before Americans head to the polls. Ms Clinton has repeatedly clashed with Donald Trump over the issue, with the Democratic candidate admitting during the first presidential debate that she had made a mistake by using the system during her time as US secretary of state. She landed in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, for a campaign stop just minutes after the FBI announcement but has so far not made any comment. Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said the letter raises \"serious questions\" and called for Ms Clinton to be removed from the presidential race. He added: \"The FBI's decision to reopen their criminal investigation into Hillary Clinton's secret email server just eleven days before the election shows how serious this discovery must be. \"This stunning development raises serious questions about what records may not have been turned over and why, and whether they show intent to violate the law. \"What's indisputable is that Hillary Clinton jeopardized classified information on thousands of occasions in her reckless attempt to hide pay-to-play corruption at her State Department. \"This alone should be disqualifying for anyone seeking the presidency, a job that is supposed to begin each morning with a top secret intelligence briefing.\" Bookmakers Betfair have also increased Trump's odds of winning the US election from 17% to 23%. While campaigning in Pennsylvania, his vice presidential candidate Mike Pence urged the FBI to \"immediately release all the emails\" so they can be seen by the American people before election day.","label":0}
{"text":"Terrifying Hurricane Matthew footage shows moment storm-chaser pilot flies straight into deadly 150mph storm: This is the terrifying moment a pilot flew straight into the 150mph winds of Hurricane Matthew . Daredevil Tim Gallagher can be seen calmly maneuvering into the eye of the killer storm , which has already claimed the lives of more than 300 people. The nerve-wracking footage shows the plane shuddering as it's thrown around while battling through the violent turbulence off Miami. There's little visibility through the windscreen as the thick clouds and rain lash the aircraft. For all the latest on Hurricane Matthew follow our live blog Moments later the winds lessen as the plane passes through the other side of the storm, which has already devastated Haiti, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and the Bahamas. Hurricane Matthew is still on course to hit around 26 million people as it passes through Florida and the east coast of the United States today. Captain Gallagher and his team are part of self-styled 'hurricane hunters' for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and deliberately fly into terrifying storms. They posted on their Facebook page ahead of their flights on #NOAA49 (GIV) and #NOAA43 (WP-3D Orion) to say they were preparing to take off at 2am into Hurricane Matthew. Shortly before 7am BST they posted another update with the incredible video. It said: \"The crew just returned from a very turbulent flight into the powerful Hurricane Matthew on WP-3D Orion NOAA43. \"Take a first hand look at the flight through the eyewall and into the eye of the storm. \"If you are in an area that may be impacted by the storm, we urge you to follow the guidance of your local emergency managers and check hurricanes.gov on a regular basis for the latest advisories.\" Incredible radar footage earlier emerged showing flight NOAA43 as it fearless headed into the eye of the hurricane off Miami. Other aircrafts were forced to remain grounded today as other pilots chose to steer clear of the storm. Two million Americans were told to leave Florida last night after being told Matthew \"is going to kill people\u201d. As 150mph winds headed for Miami, the storm was upgraded from Category Three to the second-highest Category Four \u2013 an official forecast of \u201ccatastrophic damage\u201d. It has since been downgraded back to Category Three as winds dropped to 120mph. Matthew has already swept across the Caribbean leaving at least 136 dead in Haiti. Most of the victims of the hurricane were killed by falling trees, flying debris and swollen rivers. Governor Rick Scott tonight warned: \u201cYou need to leave. Evacuate, evacuate, evacuate.\u201d He added: \u201cUnfortunately, this is going to kill people.\u201d He warned that entire neighbourhoods face being completely destroyed.","label":0}
{"text":"Do Republicans Believe Their Own Lies?: In early 2010, Republican Scott Brown unexpectedly won a special election for a Senate seat in Massachusetts. Even though this put passage of Obamacare in mortal danger, President Obama urged Congress not to move ahead until Brown had been seated. They didn\u2019t. Now, Democrats are urging Republicans to play equally fair and not move ahead with their tax bill until Doug Jones is seated following his win in the Alabama special election. Donald Trump isn\u2019t buying the comparison:  A White House official told CNN on Wednesday that the Brown example is different because Democrats passed health care in 2010 using a process that allowed them to do so with only a 50-vote majority \u2014 at the time, they had more than 50 Democrats \u2014 rendering Brown\u2019s vote less critical.  The truth is just the opposite. The Senate passed Obamacare under regular order, which meant Democrats needed 60 votes to overcome Republican filibusters. With the election of Brown, their majority was reduced to 59 votes, which means that Brown\u2019s election was more critical than Jones\u2019s. But here\u2019s the question: was this just a garden variety lie, or does the anonymous official really believe what he said? The reason I ask is that Republicans have been telling the story of Democrats \u201cjamming\u201d Obamacare down their throats using tricky parliamentary procedures for so long that, as near as I can tell, most of them believe it these days. Even though it was only seven years ago, this story has been repeated so often they\u2019ve literally forgotten that it\u2019s not true. But it\u2019s not. After Obamacare was passed normally by both House and Senate, it was only a small \u201csidecar\u201d that was added under reconciliation procedures that required 50 votes. But the sidecar was optional. Even without it, the vast bulk of Obamacare had already passed. So: was the White House flack lying, or is he just another Republican who\u2019s come to sincerely believe his own lies? Hard to say. So here\u2019s another question: Why would CNN pass this quote along without explaining that it\u2019s wrong? That\u2019s also hard to say.","label":1}

Doug Jones will clearly be the most culturally liberal senator from Alabama since the New Deal, and depending on how he compares to Hugo Black, the most economically liberal too.

{"text":"Donald Trump's latest threat rings hollow: Republican candidate for President Donald J Trump speaks to supporters at a rally at Ambridge Area Senior High School on Oct. 10, 2016 in Ambridge, Pa. There\u2019s no denying the damage Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has suffered since Friday afternoon. An audio clip from 2005 in which Trump bragged about sexual assault has thrown his candidacy and his party into turmoil, further undermining a campaign that was already losing. As Rachel noted on the show, however, more tapes may yet surface. Indeed, with four weeks remaining before Election Day, and rumors swirling, it wouldn\u2019t surprise anyone if additional recordings created new embarrassments for the controversial Republican presidential candidate. But don\u2019t worry, Republicans, Trump has a plan. In fact, as Yahoo News reported yesterday, the GOP nominee hopes to stop future tapes with a new threat.  Amid rumors of potentially more tapes showing him making inappropriate comments in the past, Donald Trump issued a threat to rival Hillary Clinton, saying Monday that if he keeps getting attacked, he\u2019ll keep talking about the women who have accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault and harassment. [\u2026] Rumors have swirled of other potentially damaging videos from his days as host of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and other past interviews floating around. And Trump seemed to confirm there could be more shoes to drop and issued a threat to his critics. \u201cThey want to release more tapes [of me] saying inappropriate things, we\u2019ll continue to talk about Bill and Hillary Clinton doing inappropriate things,\u201d the GOP nominee declared.  NBC News posted the video of these remarks online here. This is not a smart strategy. First, Trump obviously believes there are additional recordings of him \u201csaying inappropriate things,\u201d as he put it, which will only encourage researchers to keep digging, knowing there\u2019s more newsworthy content out there. Second, the Republican nominee apparently assumes those in the media doing research on Trump\u2019s record are partisans, motivated solely by Clinton\u2019s electoral interests, which he believes makes his threat potent. That\u2019s absurd. Plenty of journalists are investigating Trump\u2019s record because he\u2019s a candidate for the nation\u2019s highest office, not because they want Clinton to win. Threatening them by saying more tapes will mean more anti-Clinton attacks will have no effect. And finally, whether Trump realizes this or not, he\u2019s already fired the big gun. Over the weekend, Trump ignored his party\u2019s advice, turned back the clock 20 years, and decided assorted Bill Clinton accusers of varying degrees of credibility are now a central part of his campaign message. And it landed with a thud. As was the case in the 1990s, the attacks impressed no one except rabid far-right activists who were already going to support Trump anyway. In effect, his threat last night amounted to, \u201cStop making me look bad or I\u2019ll repeat an ineffective attack!\u201d","label":1}
{"text":"Why Trump's latest Benghazi theory matters more than most: PHOTOBLOG: People stand near a burnt car at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Donald Trump has said so many strange things about the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, it may be tempting to look past his latest tirade, assuming it\u2019s more of the same. But when it comes to the Republican candidate\u2019s rhetoric last night, don\u2019t be too quick to dismiss it out of hand. Trump addressed a crowd in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania, where he talked about Benghazi while holding a piece of paper in his hand. According to the GOP nominee, he was holding the printout of an email Sidney Blumenthal sent John Podesta \u2013 two prominent Hillary Clinton allies \u2013 in which, Trump said, Blumenthal \u201cadmitted they could have done something about Benghazi.\u201d As the crowd chanted, \u201cLock her up!\u201d Trump dropped the printout and said, \u201cThis just came out a little while ago.\u201d So, what was Trump referring to? This gets a little complicated, but stick with me. Newsweek\u2019s Kurt Eichenwald wrote a lengthy piece about Benghazi a year ago, which acknowledged, among other things, missteps from Clinton\u2019s State Department in advance of the attack. Blumenthal emailed the article to Podesta, now Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, whose emails were recently hacked, probably by Russian officials, and published online by Wikileaks. Yesterday, a Russian-controlled news agency screwed up the details, and published what it characterized as a bombshell: \u201cBlumenthal believed that the investigation into Benghazi was legitimate because it was \u2018preventable\u2019 and the result of State Department negligence.\u201d Apparently, Sputnik thought Blumenthal wrote Eichenwald\u2019s Newsweek piece, and interpreted last year\u2019s article, which has been online for 12 months and is consistent with everything we know about Benghazi, as a new, \u201cmajor revelation.\u201d Eichenwald asked last night:  This false story was reported only by the Russian-controlled agency (a reference appeared in a Turkish publication, but it was nothing but a link to the Sputnik article). So how did Donald Trump end up advancing the same falsehood put out by Putin\u2019s mouthpiece? [\u2026] The Russians engage in a sloppy disinformation effort and, before the day is out, the Republican nominee for president is standing on a stage reciting the manufactured story as truth. How did this happen? Who in the Trump campaign was feeding him falsehoods straight from the Kremlin?  Those need not be rhetorical questions. Remember, as far as Trump is concerned, \u201cThis just came out a little while ago.\u201d But as it turns out, \u201cthis\u201d refers to a bogus article from the Russian government\u2019s news website, which published a mistaken report just hours ahead of Trump\u2019s rally, where he read the nonsense directly from a piece of paper. I certainly don\u2019t expect Trump or his campaign to acknowledge the fact that he was lying to his supporters in Pennsylvania last night, but it\u2019d be interesting to learn more about how this came about. How did the mistake go from Russia\u2019s government in the morning, literally into Trump\u2019s hands in the evening? Update: The Washington Post, breaking down the timeline in detail, makes the case that Sputnik \u201dhas a reasonably large audience: A million people like it on Facebook, and nearly 200,000 follow it on Twitter,\u201d which means any number of people could\u2019ve shared it with the campaign. The piece added that this incident largely only proves that Trump \u201cwill happily pick any news off the Internet and broadcast it to the world, accurate or not.\u201d","label":1}

(Photo by Andreas Solaro\/AFP\/Getty) The week\u2019s major news story came in the form of Donald Trump, the real estate tycoon and reality television star now turned American president-elect. His victory over longtime public servant Hillary Clinton stunned the world. As election results were announced early Wednesday morning, Americans and viewers around the world responded with shock and some with sadness. Fights between Trump supporters and protesters soon broke out in front of the White House and in Times Square. Reports of attacks on Muslims and people of color began to surface as only hours after the announcement, putting many on edge. By Wednesday night, protests had spread across the nation, including New York City, Chicago, Miami and Oakland, California. The president-elect has his work cut out for him in terms of uniting the country and proving to the majority population \u2014 who gave the popular vote to Clinton \u2014 that he is trustworthy. But Trump is off to a tumultuous start, already creating controversy with his cabinet picks, by bucking the press pool tradition on his trip to meet President Obama at the White House on Thursday, and going on a quick Twitter rant about demonstrators protesting against his win.

{"text":"What Is Paul Ryan Thinking?: House Speaker Paul Ryan at CPAC 2016 in March. (Photo: Gage Skidmore) The House speaker could have left Trump alone rather than stab him in the back. Having suffered the political equivalent of a blown tire while driving along an icy mountain road on Friday night, GOP nominee Donald J. Trump stabilized a seemingly fatal situation by Sunday evening. Through his commanding, issue-driven performance against Hillary Clinton in the second presidential debate, Trump steered his vehicle into a turnout. He replaced the flat with a new steel-belted radial and readied himself to return to the challenging road ahead. But on Monday morning, House speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) raced in, slashed Trump\u2019s tire anew, and nudged him toward the closest cliff. Ryan could have left things alone, with Trump\u2019s Access Hollywood tape receding in the rear-view mirror. Instead, Ryan donned his peacock feathers for an especially flamboyant display of moral preening. Ryan erased the gap that Trump had placed between his candidacy and this controversy. Rather than let it be, Ryan dragged this whole episode back into the middle of the road. During a conference call with GOP House members on Monday, Ryan reportedly announced that he neither would defend Trump nor campaign with him between now and Election Day. Naturally, pro-Clinton journalists (forgive the redundancy) fanned this hot coal into a forest fire. Ryan could maintain his perch atop the moral high ground and do so quietly. He simply could go about his business and avoid Trump\u2019s events. He could respond to journalists\u2019 questions about the GOP nominee with bromides such as \u201cI wish Donald Trump well and look forward to winning a larger House Republican majority on the night he wins the White House.\u201d This would have maintained peace on the right. Instead, the day after Trump\u2019s solid debate effort became the new narrative, Ryan needlessly fathered the unprecedented phenomenon of a Republican standard-bearer and a Republican speaker in open warfare with each other \u2014 just four weeks before a general election. More than merely foolish politics, this episode exposes the reputedly level-headed Ryan as truly, deeply morally warped. Everyone agrees that Trump\u2019s comments about women (including references to female genitalia) were disappointing and inappropriate. Trump apologized for them twice before the latest debate and did so again at Sunday\u2019s face-off against Clinton. \u201cThis was locker-room talk,\u201d Trump told a town hall in St. Louis. \u201cI am not proud of it. I apologized to my family. I apologized to the American people. . . . I am very embarrassed by it, and I hate it, but it\u2019s locker-room talk.\u201d (Remember: Trump\u2019s words from 2005 are at issue here, not his actions. Conversely, Bill Clinton\u2019s actual behavior somehow is no big deal. Journalists, feminists, and Democrats seem utterly uninterested in his sexual shenanigans with Monica Lewinsky, his widely acknowledged sexual harassment of Paula Jones, his alleged sexual assault of Kathleen Willey, and even a very credible accusation of rape by Juanita Broaddrick.) But these multiple apologies were not good enough for Ryan. Apparently, Trump\u2019s words are beyond forgiveness. So, Ryan snipped Trump\u2019s brake lines, folded his arms, and is watching Trump\u2019s sedan roll toward a precipice. Ryan should ask himself these questions, as should those who applaud his behavior this week: \u2010Is Trump\u2019s \u201clocker-room talk\u201d so objectionable that Ryan would stand by and let Hillary Clinton win the White House? If so, then in exchange for having a president who does not use \u201cthe P word\u201d (as far as we know), America would be at the mercy of a more liberal, pro-choice Supreme Court. Concurrently, a Hillary-led federal government would work tirelessly to provide tax dollars for thousands \u2014 perhaps hundreds of thousands \u2014 of abortions. To hell with Trump\u2019s plans to turn the Hyde Amendment into an actual federal statute. Hillary wants to kill the Hyde Amendment. But at least she will avoid the P word. Ryan should ask himself: Which is worse, the sound of Trump on an 11-year-old tape or the silent screams of murdered unborn children whose numbers surely will climb under the militantly pro-abortion Hillary Clinton? \u2010 As the price for having a president who does not use the P word, Ryan seems willing to let a President Hillary Clinton keep America\u2019s taxes high, complex, unreformed, and anti-competitive. The corporate tax rate would stay at 35 percent, as taxes overall climbed by $1.55 trillion. That would stick it to Trump, what with his P word, his 15 percent corporate tax rate, and his $4.4 trillion tax cut. \u2010 As payment for having a president who avoids the P word, Ryan would hang back and let the prime mover of the disastrous Iran nuclear deal protect it as president and continue Obama\u2019s policy of appeasing and, even worse, subsidizing Tehran\u2019s radical-Islamic terror state with air-freight deliveries of cash and gold totaling between $1.7 billion and $ 33.6 billion. Who needs Trump, his P word, and a tough stance on Iran \u2014 including scrapping or at least overhauling the Iran nuclear deal and its $150 billion in unfrozen assets? More federally subsidized abortions, more high taxes, and more goodies for the ayatollahs. #related#These awful things, and many more, would be the venomous spawn of a Hillary Clinton administration. Conversely, a President Trump likely would sign most legislation that a Republican Congress put on his desk. What an opportunity! Who, precisely, does Ryan think would sign any remotely pro-market reform that a GOP Congress sent to a President Hillary Clinton? This vital question seems trivial to Ryan. But \u2014 great news! \u2014 if Hillary Clinton were to be elected, America would have a president who does not use the P word. And as Paul Ryan would cheer, at least we would have that going for us.

{"text":"Hillary\u2019s New Hires Would Go Far Beyond the Supreme Court: (Reuters photo: Carlos Barria) Hillary Clinton\u2019s critics correctly warn that she could name one or more justices to the U.S. Supreme Court. But that would be just a start. As conservative activist Richard Viguerie has argued for years: \u201cPersonnel is policy.\u201d A President Hillary Clinton would nominate hundreds of people to top positions that require Senate approval. She would hire hundreds of thousands of others and unleash them to perpetrate Hillaryism \u2014 a toxic blend of lies, elitist nannyism, secretive paranoia, and snarling contempt for the law. These people would enjoy police powers, fat salaries, mouth-watering benefits, and bullet-proof job security \u2014 at taxpayer expense. If Hillary nominated only one liberal jurist to replace the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, she could nudge the Court to the left for decades. Free speech, religious liberty, gun rights, separation of powers, free enterprise, federalism, and unborn Americans all would be in the cross hairs. But her influence would go far, far beyond that. Other Supreme Court vacancies could arise, of course. Thirteen federal appeals-court seats are empty. So are 77 federal trial-court benches. Also, 14 other judges have announced their plans to retire between now and June 2017. All told, by next Independence Day, Hillary could name 105 like-minded judges to these federal courts. And that\u2019s just the judicial branch. Hillary would nominate 15 cabinet secretaries who share her collectivist vision. The secretaries of state, treasury, labor, transportation, and others, in turn, would be encircled by platoons of undersecretaries, deputy secretaries, assistant secretaries, and their secretaries. The federal government includes \u201c137 independent executive agencies with 268 components,\u201d according to USA.gov. Hillary would employ the heads of these bodies, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Internal Revenue Service, and many, many more. Beyond that, ad hoc boards, commissions, and blue-ribbon panels also would clamor for chiefs. And then we have the Indians. Obama employed at least 143,000 federal staffers during his first term, Investor\u2019s Business Daily estimates. Hillary likely would hire as many federal workers in her image or merely leave thousands of Obamites in place and let them keep on keeping on. Neither prospect is appetizing.  As a devoted disciple of Saul Alinsky, Hillary understands the first of his twelve Rules for Radicals.  As a devoted disciple of Saul Alinsky, Hillary understands the first of his twelve Rules for Radicals: \u201cPower is derived from two main sources \u2014 money and people. \u2018Have-Nots\u2019 must build power from flesh and blood.\u201d Thus, she would hire smart, focused, far-left lawyers, economists, inspectors, and administrators to enter the bureaucracy, burrow like termites, and slowly nibble away at what remains of this beautiful country. Thousands of young Rodhamites could infest America\u2019s federal agencies and cause incalculable damage until they retire \u2014 30 or 40 years hence. #share#The flip side of this threat is a yuuuuuge opportunity: A President Trump would nominate his own candidates for the Supreme Court and lower benches. The 20 well-respected jurists whom he identified as potential justices all would return the High Court to a more constitutionalist path. So would his circuit- and district-court nominees. As for his cabinet appointees and top aides, just imagine these patriots working to clean up after Obama and help Trump make America great again: \u2022 Secretary of State Newt Gingrich \u2022 Treasury Secretary Steve Forbes \u2022 Defense Secretary KT McFarland \u2022 Attorney General Rudolph W.

If asked, many of them would serve our country in a Trump Administration. #related#Those who worry about Hillary Clinton\u2019s impact on the Supreme Court should meditate much more broadly about her hundreds of thousands of potential nominations and new hires \u2014 all across the federal government. In contrast to that frightful picture, visualize the conservative, free-market constitutionalists whom Donald J. Trump would place in those positions. Think carefully. Vote accordingly.","label":1}
{"text":"Just the Facts, Ma\u2019am: (Reuters photo: Carlos Barria) Hillary Clinton\u2019s cascading e-mail troubles are dragging her down \u2500 while issues are lifting Donald Trump up. We knew there could be a big October surprise before this bizarre and unpopular election finally came to an end. But who knew it would come from e-mails found on a device used by former Rep. Anthony Weiner that was confiscated by the FBI after he allegedly sexted an underage woman \u2014 an act that cost him his job, his income, and his marriage? As I pondered this on Friday afternoon, I had a faint recollection of Winston Churchill describing a tough loss in an MP election. Hat tip to Susan Varga, who located this Churchill gem: \u201cIn a twinkling of an eye, I found myself without an office, without a seat, without a party, and without an appendix.\u201d Churchill had his appendix taken out during that election, which took place in 1922. So let\u2019s see here. Anthony Weiner lost his office and his seat. And while I don\u2019t know about his appendix, he did lose his marriage for referring to matters below the waist. And Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton\u2019s aide and Weiner\u2019s soon to be ex-wife, may well lose her seat and her office, although I couldn\u2019t find any information about her appendix, despite a long Google search. On the other hand, the FBI\u2019s bombshell that it is reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private e-mail server may well cause the Democratic presidential candidate to lose her office, her seat, and her party. As to the condition of her appendix, we\u2019ll just have to guess, since no one knows the state of her deteriorating health. And then we have FBI director James Comey, who may well be on his way to losing his office, his seat, and his reputation. (I have no information on the status of his appendix.) And how bizarrely ironic is it that Comey \u2014 who lost considerable credibility a couple of months ago for building an iron-clad case against Hillary and then letting her off the hook \u2014 is now reopening her case based not on Russian espionage or Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks, but on Anthony Weiner\u2019s electronic sex life? This will not bring honor and glory to J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s venerable crime-fighting organization. Comey\u2019s announcement, by the way, follows hot on the heels of the revelation that Clinton pal and Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe channeled near $500,000 into the failed state senate campaign of Jill McCabe, who is the wife of FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who helped oversee the agency\u2019s investigation into Clinton\u2019s private e-mail server. And let it be known that Hillary helped raise $1 million for McAuliffe\u2019s PAC. Did any of these connections have anything to do with Hillary\u2019s getting off scot free from a criminal indictment? Nah. But wait, could it be that Donald Trump\u2019s accusation that the system is rigged is correct after all? Now, from Churchill to Jack Webb. Remember him? He played LAPD Detective Sergeant Joe Friday on the great Dragnet series. He opened the show with, \u201cThis is the city: Los Angeles, California. I work here. I\u2019m a cop.\u201d But the straight-shooting Detective Friday may be better known for this deadpan phrase: \u201cJust the facts, ma\u2019am.\u201d Those are words that may go to the very heart of this presidential election. No matter what James Comey unveils in the days ahead, if anything, virtually no one in this country believes Hillary Clinton will ever divulge \u201cjust the facts.\u201d #related#That\u2019s what the polls say, and for her they\u2019re getting worse. And that\u2019s exactly what the FBI bombshell has reminded the voting public. Clinton, Inc., is dishonest, above the law, on the take. New WikiLeaks-provided e-mails from Clinton aide Doug Band reveal the true nature of the Clinton cash operation: No matter what the stated humanitarian goals of the Clinton Foundation, every fiber and sinew of the organization is wrapped in self-dealing, self-enrichment, fraud, and corruption. This is how the Clinton\u2019s got rich. They traded cash for State Department visits and cash for government favors (like signing away 20 percent of American uranium reserves to oligarchic pals of Vladimir Putin). And let\u2019s not forget those $450,000 speeches by Bill Clinton and those $250,000 speeches by Hillary herself. And she can\u2019t even tell the truth about that, as leaked e-mails show that she said one thing to Wall Street and quite another to the public. The election is a week and a half away, and the atmosphere has changed significantly. In the last several days, at long last, Donald Trump has been talking issues on the campaign trail. Issues like the economy, tax cuts, the need to repeal and rewrite Obamacare, and even African American inner-city problems. During this period Hillary Clinton was deluged with e-mail leaks and blindsided by the FBI. Issues beat e-mail leaks. Polls are rapidly narrowing. Suddenly, the potential for a GOP three-house electoral sweep is growing larger.","label":1}
{"text":"The Trials of Saint Hillary: (Reuters photo: Brian Snyder) Hillary Clinton\u2019s e-mail scandal is about her corruption, not the FBI director\u2019s anti-woman bias. Hillary Clinton is perfect. That, apparently, is the Left\u2019s new line on their nominee. It was one thing to label her a corrupt old crone when she was running against newfangled 1930s near-octogenarian Bernie Sanders. It was another thing to sigh over her foibles when she led Donald Trump by double digits. But in a close election, Democrats have decided to don the blinders: Hillary is a saint. And all who oppose her are angels of darkness. When Hillary\u2019s e-mail scandal first cropped up, the Left acknowledged Hillary\u2019s dicey relationship with the truth, but praised rival Bernie Sanders for his gentlemanly unwillingness to exploit Hillary\u2019s corruption for political gain. Then, when Sanders finally shuffled off into the political sunset, they shifted their narrative: Now, Hillary was being targeted over speculation and innuendo \u2014 but she had some of that coming, given her decision to set up a private e-mail server. When the FBI effectively closed its original investigation, they could point to FBI director James Comey\u2019s supposed rectitude as evidence for their theory that Hillary had made a mistake, but she hadn\u2019t done anything criminal. Then, like a zombie rising from the dead, E-mailgate returned: twice as brutal, twice as ugly, and twice as unkillable. It\u2019s too late in the election cycle to ward off E-mailgate with some tut-tutting or a wave of the hand. This election is too close for Democrats to simply acknowledge Hillary\u2019s corruption, then vote for her in order to stop Trump. No, they must blind themselves to Hillary\u2019s corruption utterly, and blind others to it as well. They must spray lye in the eyes of the public to protect Hillary\u2019s lies. And so the Left have declared their new enemies: James Comey, and supposed sexism. Parodic New York Times columnist Charles Blow led the way with a column titled \u201c Emails, Genitalia and the FBI.\u201d Blow now alleges that the election is rigged \u2014 sound familiar? \u2014 by nefarious forces beyond Hillary\u2019s control. \u201cThis election isn\u2019t in danger of being stolen by Hillary Clinton,\u201d Blow says, \u201cbut in danger of being stolen from her.\u201d And why, pray tell, would James Comey, Hillary\u2019s heretofore savior, turn on her like a Judas? Because, writes Blow, \u201cthis is just the latest lifeline being thrown to a Republican candidate drowning in his own ineptitude.\u201d Comey must be working for the Trumps. Or the Russians. Or somebody. Senator Harry Reid (D., Nev.), a petrifying political cow dropping, has accused Comey, in full Joe McCarthy fashion, of the same malfeasance. \u201cI am writing to inform you that my office has determined that [your] actions may violate the Hatch Act,\u201d Reid wrote to Comey. \u201cIn my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government#\u2026#[but] you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information.\u201d Reid is now approximately five minutes from brandishing a list of Communists before the cameras, calling for Comey\u2019s resignation. And Harry Reid isn\u2019t the only one. Baltimore mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake \u2014 a woman who once declared that she would let rioters destroy her city because it was imperative to give them \u201croom\u201d to express themselves \u2014 called Comey \u201creckless\u201d and suggested that \u201che\u2019s under pressure and he got shook.\u201d Former attorney general Eric Holder, who is still under contempt of Congress, declared Comey\u2019s actions absolutely deplorable. Most hilarious, Professor Robin Lakoff of the University of California, Berkeley, labeled the entire enterprise sexist. \u201c Emailgate is a bitch hunt,\u201d she wrote at Time.com, \u201cbut the target is not Hillary Clinton. It\u2019s us. The only reason the whole email flap has legs is because the candidate is female. Can you imagine this happening to a man?\u201d  Too many Republicans look at how Democrats rally around awful people ranging from Bill Clinton to Teddy Kennedy, and think, \u2018How can we do that?\u2019  Lakoff apparently forgot that this re-investigation exists only began because a man, Anthony Weiner, is under FBI investigation; she apparently forgot that General David Petraeus was punished for similar crimes; she apparently neglects that 91 percent of all prison inmates are men, and that virtually every political scandal in history has targeted a man. But never mind that: Hillary must be shielded, and if her genitalia will serve the cause, so be it! One of the most disappointing aspects of this election cycle has been the realization by some conservatives that many of our fellow conservatives want to be Democrats. They want to be Democrats not in terms of policy, although some Trump fans are indistinguishable from blue dog Democrats. They want to be Democrats in terms of politician-worship. Too many Republicans look at how Democrats rally around awful people ranging from Bill Clinton to Teddy Kennedy, and think, \u201cHow can we do that? If we just did that, we\u2019d be able to elect more Republicans!\u201d There\u2019s truth to that. Obviously, Democrats are willing to stand with their candidates, even after those candidates use their interns as humidors or their female friends as car anchors. But that\u2019s what distinguishes Republicans from Democrats historically. And even when Republicans begin to act like Democrats \u2014 when we begin to excuse the worst excesses of our candidates in the name of victory \u2014 it doesn\u2019t work all that well. Many Republicans still agonize over the foibles and evils of Trump. Many Republicans won\u2019t vote for him. The same doesn\u2019t hold true for Democrats, who may pretend at skepticism but fall into pure godworship the moment the chips are down. Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t a victim. She created a private server for her own benefit, and she\u2019s been ensnared in her own paranoia and ambition. The fact that Democrats will cling to her sainthood despite that obvious truth demonstrates that Democrats cannot be trusted with power. To the extent that Republicans imitate Democrats, they can\u2019t be trusted with power either. Yes, at long last, the Left has pulled its anti-Trump card: Hillary has a vagina, and is being targeted for that supposedly debilitating condition. The attempts to paint E-mailgate as sexism demonstrate the Left\u2019s blindness to Hillary\u2019s flaws. At least we acknowledge Trump\u2019s faults in the GOP \u2014 or at least a major segment of us do. The Left\u2019s attempts to pawn off all anti-Hillary scandals as effects of sexism (and Obama\u2019s as effects of racism) are a basic avoidance maneuver.

{"text":"A Fitting Final Chapter to the Sleaze Sweepstakes: Hillary Clinton campaigns in Lake Worth, Fla., October 26, 2016. (Reuters photo: Carlos Barria) As the presidential campaigns sink to the challenge of demonstrating that there is no such thing as rock bottom, remember this: When the Clintons decamped from Washington in January 2001, they took some White House furnishings that were public property. They also finished accepting more than $190,000 in gifts, including two coffee tables and two chairs, a $7,375 gratuity from Denise Rich, whose fugitive former husband had been pardoned in President Clinton\u2019s final hours. A Washington Post editorial (\u201cCount the Spoons\u201d) identified \u201cthe Clintons\u2019 defining characteristic: They have no capacity for embarrassment. Words like shabby and tawdry come to mind. They don\u2019t begin to do it justice.\u201d Today, Hillary Clinton strives to live again among some White House furnishings that she and her helpmeet were compelled to disgorge. Her campaign flounders because as secretary of state some of the nation\u2019s business might have been melded with the contents of a computer that is pertinent to an FBI investigation of a former Democratic congressman\u2019s alleged sexual texting with a female minor. Ransack the English language for words to do this justice. During the recent welter of reports about the Clintons\u2019 self-dealing through their charity that has been very charitable to them, The New Yorker, reporting her plans to uplift the downtrodden, quoted her aspiration: \u201cI want to really marry the public and the private sector.\u201d This would solve the Clintons\u2019 problem of discerning the line between public business and private aggrandizement: Erase the line. So, herewith America\u2019s choice. Restore the House of Clinton. Or confer executive powers \u2014 powers that President Obama by his audacity, and Congress by its lethargy, have proven to be essentially unlimited \u2014 on another competitor in the sleaze sweepstakes, Donald Trump, who shares his opponent\u2019s disinclination to disentangle the personal and the political. RELATED: History Repeats: A Nixonian Cover-up in the Homestretch of the Campaign Into this political maelstrom, FBI director James Comey injected an announcement that intensified the chaos without providing a scintilla of news that voters can use: An unknown number of e-mails of unknown provenance and unknown content might be \u201cpertinent\u201d to an investigation that already has established, beyond peradventure, that Secretary Clinton was \u201cextremely careless\u201d with sensitive material. Add the FBI, and the Justice Department to which it belongs, to the carnage of institutions that is a byproduct of bad judgments by the political class that have voters asking Casey Stengel\u2019s question. In 1962, Stengel, manager of the New York Mets, an expansion team en route to a record of 120 losses, looked down his dugout at his woebegone players and wondered aloud, \u201cCan\u2019t anybody here play this game?\u201d It is grimly hilarious to hear it said that the Justice Department, by not holding Comey to established protocols concerning discussions of ongoing investigations, and concerning pronouncements close to elections, has tainted itself. Obamacare would not have passed if Justice Department lawyers had not conducted what a federal judge declared a corrupt prosecution of Alaska\u2019s Republican senator Ted Stevens, costing him reelection. The department has enabled, by not seriously investigating, the IRS\u2019s suppression of political advocacy by conservative groups. Or of the IRS\u2019s subsequent destruction of subpoenaed e-mails pertinent to this. So, unsurprisingly, the most intrusive and potentially punitive federal agency continues to punish conservative groups for being conservative, according to Cleta Mitchell, a lawyer for political groups who confirms there are indeed conservative organizations who were targeted by the IRS and have still not received their tax-exempt status. In 2013, Barack Obama professed himself \u201cangry\u201d about \u201cinexcusable\u201d IRS behavior, before he decided there was not a \u201csmidgen\u201d of IRS corruption. He claimed to have learned about the IRS behavior from the media. Now he claims that he learned from the media about Clinton\u2019s e-mail abuses, although they had exchanged e-mails using her private server. Perhaps. The defining scandal of the Obama era has been the media\u2019s lackadaisical consensus that Obama\u2019s administration has had no serious scandal. This, although with the Justice Department protecting the IRS, the administration has (in the words of Richard Nixon\u2019s White House counsel John Dean) used \u201cthe available federal machinery to screw our political enemies.\u201d #related#Clinton, the ultimate author of her current agony, resembles no one so much as Nixon in her paranoia and joyless pursuit of joy. Her government career began with the House committee preparing Nixon\u2019s impeachment. Twenty-two years earlier, he had saved his career by addressing a supposed scandal with his nationally broadcast \u201cCheckers speech,\u201d which was mawkish, abasing, and effective. How fitting it would be for a Clinton \u201cCheckers speech\u201d to end our long national nightmare that this campaign has been.","label":1}
{"text":"Who Deserves Credit for the Trump Administration\u2019s Accomplishments?: President Trump speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House in July. (Reuters photo: Joshua Roberts) Contrary to what many predicted, President Trump\u2019s end-of-year accomplishment list isn\u2019t that skimpy. That\u2019s an analytical observation. For many, particularly liberals and Democrats, Trump\u2019s first year hasn\u2019t been merely bad. It\u2019s a great evil, a grievous wound to the American body politic. But even that is a kind of partisan tribute to what\u2019s been accomplished on his watch: a record number of judicial appointments, including a Supreme Court justice; the defeat of Islamic State; repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate; tax reform; and major rollbacks of various regulations, from arctic drilling to net neutrality. It hasn\u2019t exactly been smooth sailing. Trump is the most unpopular first-year president in American history, for reasons far beyond mere bad press. Still, among conservatives, the tally of \u201cwins\u201d has sparked some intramural debates. The most prominent one is how Trump skeptics and avowed Never Trumpers should respond to those wins. For writers such as the Washington Post\u2019s Jennifer Rubin and The Atlantic\u2019s David Frum, the only legitimate response is either to ignore these successes or denigrate them, lest people lose sight of the threat Trump poses to the country. Others, including myself, argue instead that one needn\u2019t deny the merits of a policy victory simply because the president might get credit for it. This debate skips over the larger question of whether these victories happened because of Trump or despite him. On one level, the president always gets the credit \u2014 or blame \u2014 for anything that happens on his watch. But Trump poses a challenge to such superficial scorekeeping. No president in American history has rejected Harry Truman\u2019s \u201cThe buck stops here\u201d motto as vehemently or consistently as this one. He never accepts responsibility for his own mistakes, never mind those of his administration or party. When American troops die, the commander in chief blames \u201cthe generals.\u201d When legislation fails, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the \u201cestablishment\u201d are at fault. Trump boosters agree. Conservative writer Roger Simon argues that all \u201cremaining Never Trumpers\u201d must apologize for being wrong about the president. He chalks up Trump\u2019s \u201castoundingly successful\u201d first year to the fact the president is a \u201cquick study.\u201d But what evidence is there that Trump has actually learned the art of presidential management? Aside from the mandatory flattery required of Republican elected officials, there\u2019s remarkably little testimony that Trump has involved himself in the process of governing. Tax reform was carried across the finish line by the GOP congressional leadership. Net neutrality was repealed by independent Republicans at the Federal Communications Commission. Foreign policy is a more mixed bag. If the president deserves credit for the defeat of Islamic State, it\u2019s because he let \u201cthe generals\u201d do their thing. On the other hand, credit (or blame) for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel or pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris accord on climate change certainly goes to him. In general, it seems to me that Trump\u2019s success (such as it is) is less attributable to sudden mastery of the issues than to staying out of the way of rank-and-file Republican policymakers, activists, and bureaucrats. For instance, the task of selecting judicial appointees, starting with Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, has largely been outsourced to the Federalist Society. When the president revealed his new national-security strategy last week, his speech \u2014 the usual campaign blather \u2014 had only a passing resemblance to the underlying document. The tax bill is clearly more in line with House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s ideology than candidate Trump\u2019s supposed populism. As for a counter-example: When Trump was \u201chands-on\u201d with Obamacare repeal, he often revealed he didn\u2019t even know what was in the legislation. In 2016, some conservatives argued that Republicans should vote as if we live in a parliamentary democracy, electing a party, not a person. Trump\u2019s 3,000 political appointees would be better than Hillary Clinton\u2019s. That argument had its flaws, not least that voters tend not to compartmentalize that way \u2014 which is why the GOP faces a potential bloodbath in the 2018 midterms. But there\u2019s merit to it as well. To listen to Trump\u2019s cheerleaders, the biggest obstacle to conservative victories is the party establishment, when in reality it looks more like it\u2019s running the show.

{"text":"Video: Angry fans torch season tickets, merchandise over NFL anthem protests: Team merch is one thing, although it\u2019s better off being donated to Goodwill than torched. But season tickets? For fark\u2019s sake. Scalp them or put them on StubHub. If you can\u2019t bear the thought of accepting compensation for ridding yourself of something so evil, donate the proceeds to a veterans\u2019 group. Your Instagram video going viral can\u2019t be worth as much to you as you paid for those seats. Although \u2026 now that I look more closely at the clip below, is it Colts tickets that the guy\u2019s burning? In that case, yeah, light \u2019em up.  Wait... now Cohen is offering a guilty plea? I wonder if the president\u2019s seen this video yet. It would cheer him up after last night\u2019s humiliation in Alabama. The man knows what he\u2019s doing with this NFL business:  But there was one part of the trip [to Alabama last week] that cheered him up, according to three people close to the president: rallygoers\u2019 thunderous approval of his attack on Colin Kaepernick, a former N.F.L. quarterback, for kneeling in protest during the national anthem, a slam punctuated by an epithet-laced suggestion that team owners fire employees who disrespect patriotic tradition\u2026 In private, the president and his top aides freely admit that he is engaged in a culture war on behalf of his white, working-class base, a New York billionaire waging war against \u201cpolitically correct\u201d coastal elites on behalf of his supporters in the South and in the Midwest. He believes the war was foisted upon him by former President Barack Obama and other Democrats \u2014 and he is determined to win, current and former aides said.  Is he winning the culture war over the NFL? Well, per Reuters, 58 percent agree with him that pro athletes should be required to stand for the anthem and 37 percent, including 67 percent of Republicans, say they\u2019ve become less favorable to the NFL. The share that say they support the stance taken by Colin Kaepernick and other kneeling players is up 12 points from last year, though, from 28 percent then to 40 now. Trump\u2019s entry into this debate is probably polarizing it along partisan lines; we may end up with less consensus now over anthem protests than we had before purely because Democrats are so reluctant to back him on a cultural hot-button. Also, when you ask if players should be *fired* for refusing to stand, the majority shifts: 57 percent say no, including 29 percent of Republicans, while 53 percent think that the president shouldn\u2019t be comment publicly on how the NFL and its players act during the anthem. It\u2019s safe to say the public supports POTUS in wanting players to stand, they just don\u2019t agree that there should be a penalty for dissent. This result is interesting too. The columns, from left to right, represent overall public opinion, Democrats, Republicans, and independents: One criticism leveled at the protests is that public anger is not just about the anthem, it\u2019s about employees dragging their politics into their place of business. Average Americans would never be allowed to get away with that. If this is accurate, though, a plurality are okay with athletes mixing politics with sports. It depends on the politics, of course, and on avoiding disrespect to the flag. Mo Brooks said yesterday that the feds could bite back at the NFL for not disciplining players who refuse to stand for the anthem by halting advertising for the armed forces during games. The Pentagon might not be keen on that \u2014 there aren\u2019t a ton of opportunities on TV to reliably reach a mostly male audience, and jeopardizing recruitment isn\u2019t an obvious move to make when you\u2019re otherwise busy yelling at Kaepernick for supposedly insulting the military. But it is a point of leverage, as are the lucrative subsidies teams receive from state and local governments for stadiums. I wonder how that would fare in court. Government normally can cut funding for basically any reason but not quite every reason. A court would have something to say, I assume, if Congress cut funds to a state for a nakedly bigoted purpose, e.g., because it had a large percentage of minorities. Courts have been more aggressive in the Trump era in scrutinizing the motives behind policies too, most famously in the case of the travel ban where federal judges looked at POTUS\u2019s comments about Muslims as a candidate to find that the ban violates equal protection. If the Pentagon cut funds to the NFL over anthem protests and the league sued on grounds of viewpoint discrimination under the First Amendment, how would that case go? Straightforward matter of government not being required to subsidize speech with which it disagrees or would some judge reach to find a constitutionally impermissible motive?

His epic clap back is loaded with juicy words, and the best part is, they're all used to insult Kellyanne Conway. Kellyanne Conway used the allegations against Harvey Weinstein of years of sexual harassment and abuse to attack Hillary Clinton (not the president).

{"text":"Chris Cuomo Challenges A Republican Lawmaker: Trump Is Dismantling Obamacare \u2018On The Backs Of The Most Needy\u2019: 00:00 Following President Trump\u2019s dead-of-night announcement that he\u2019d end subsidies that help low-income Americans purchase health insurance, CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo hosted Rep. Jim Jordan, the Republican Chairman Emeritus of the Freedom Caucus, who strenuously defended the move. However, Cuomo was equally passionate while arguing that Trump is torpedoing Obamacare in an effort to prove that Obama\u2019s signature policy is a disaster to America. Yet Jordan believes that Trump is simply ending payments to insurance companies that the Justice Department considers \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d The above clip begins after Cuomo calls Trump an \u201cemperor\u201d for relying upon executive orders every time Congress doesn\u2019t succeed at passing his agendas. Cuomo also argued that there\u2019s no conceivable way that removing these subsidies would be beneficial for low-income Americans:  \u201cYou cannot find a reasonable health care analyst who will look at cutting the subsidies, shrinking the enrollment period, and doing other things that the president\u2019s doing in his executive order and what you\u2019re trying to do in your bill, that makes it better for American families\u201d\u201d  Further, Cuomo accused Republicans of allowing Trump to intentionally destroy Obama care while \u201cdoing it on the backs of the most needy.\u201d Jordan argued, \u201cYou can\u2019t stabilize this thing, it\u2019s already falling apart.\u201d To which Cuomo countered, \u201cYou\u2019re making it fall apart!\u201d Trump\u2019s removal of subsidies is projected to substantially elevate insurance premiums and increase deductibles for families and individuals near the poverty line. And again, Trump is using his executive power to chip away at Obamacare \u2014 the subsidy removal is the 12th instance of this strategy \u2014 following the GOP Congress\u2019 repeated attempts to \u201crepeal and replace.\u201d (Via CNN)","label":1}
{"text":"Mensa Offers To Host An IQ-Test Showdown Between Rex Tillerson And President Trump: Getty Image Apparently size does matter \u2014 IQ size, that is. President Trump challenged Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to an IQ test after hearing in a news report that Tillerson might have called the POTUS a \u201cmoron.\u201d If Trump wants to put the proverbial money where his mouth is, Mensa, the elite society for those with ultra-high IQs, has indicated they can make that test happen. \u201cAmerican Mensa would be happy to hold a testing session for President Trump and Secretary Tillerson,\u201d said Mensa communications director Charles Brown. That\u2019s an offer of more than just an IQ test \u2014 Mensa offers admission only to those who rank in the top 2% of test scores. Brown wouldn\u2019t say one way or the other if any high-profile politicians in Trump and Tillerson\u2019s league are already members of the intelligence society. The matter began after an MSNBC report cited three anonymous sources who claim Tillerson called Trump a \u201cmoron\u201d during a July meeting. Tillerson brushed the article aside as \u201c petty nonsense,\u201d but Trump hasn\u2019t gotten over the alleged slight since the story broke. He tweeted that MSNBC is \u201cfake news\u201d and accused them of having low ratings, as if to agree with Tillerson that the \u201cmoron\u201d comment is untrue. Maybe he\u2019s just riled up that Tillerson is grabbing headlines. Either way, by attacking MSNBC and challenging his Secretary of State to an IQ contest, Trump has tacitly admitted that even a hypothetical insult to his intelligence has him hot under the collar. Still, this IQ showdown has shades of the familiar. After all, this is a President who has wrung his hands over the size of his inauguration crowd and boasted over the hugeness of his ratings versus those of his \u201cfailing\u201d critics. Not to mention everything that came out of that time Marco Rubio commented on Trump\u2019s tiny hands. (Via The Hill)","label":1}
{"text":"Contaminated foods from China flooding into the U.S. under the \u2018Organic\u2019 label: Natural Health 365 reports that several foods within the country are so contaminated that Chinese citizens don\u2019t trust them. What\u2019s more, the countries that import these tainted foods are putting their citizens at risk. The Chinese food production industry is one of the world\u2019s least-regulated and most corrupt, as has repeatedly been proven time and again. Now, it appears, there is no trusting anything that comes from China marked \u201corganic.\u201d U.S. Customs personnel often turn away food shipments from China because they contain unsavory additivesand drug residues, are mislabeled, or are just generally filthy. Some Chinese food exporters have responded by labeling their products \u201corganic,\u201d though they are far from it. There are several factors at play which make Chinese claims of organic unreliable. First, environmental pollution from unrestrained and unregulated industrial growth has so polluted soiland waterways with toxic heavy metals that nothing grown in them is safe, much less organic. Also, there is so much fraudulent labeling and rampant corruption within the government and manufacturing sectors that it\u2019s not smart to trust what is put on packaging. In fact, farmers in China use water that is replete with heavy metals, Natural Health 365 noted in a separate report. In addition, water used for irrigation also contains organicand inorganic substances and pollutants. Chinese \u201corganic\u201d food is so contaminated that a person could get ill just by handling some of it. \u2018Dirty water\u2019 is all there is The report noted further:  \u201cThis is reality \u2013 all of China\u2019s grains, vegetablesand fruits are irrigated with untreated industrial wastewater. The Yellow River, which is considered unusable, supports major food producing areas in the northeast provinces.\u201d  Many Chinese farmers won\u2019t even eat the food they produce, if you can believe that. That\u2019s because it\u2019s clear that China\u2019s water pollution issues are so pronounced that it threatens the country\u2019s entire food supply. Chinese farmers have said there is no available water for crops except \u201c dirty water.\u201d As part of the country\u2019s industrial prowess, it is also one of the largest producers (and consumers) of fertilizers and pesticides, Water Politics reported. The site noted further that as China\u2019s industrial might grows, so too does the level of contaminants in the country\u2019s water supply. Lakes, rivers, streams and falling water tables are becoming more polluted by the year. In addition to man-made pollutants, animals produce about 90 percent of the organic pollutants and half of the nitrogen in China\u2019s water, say experts at the Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning. There are times when water is so polluted it turns black \u2013 yet it is still used to irrigate crops, and of course, that affects so-called organic farming operations as well. These nine foods are particularly vulnerable to becoming tainted, Natural Health 365 noted: Fish: Some 80 percent of the tilapiasold in the U.S. come from fish farms in China, as well as half the cod. Water pollution in China is a horrible problem, so any fish grown there are suspect. Chicken: Poultry produced in China is very often plagued with illnesses like avian flu. Apples and apple juice: Only recently has the U.S. moved to allow the importation of Chinese apples, though American producers grow plenty for the country and the world. Rice: Though this is a staple in China and much of the rice in the U.S. comes from there, some of it has been found to be made of resin and potato. Mushrooms: Some 34 percent of processed mushroomscome from China. Salt: Some salt produced in China for industrial uses has made its way to American dinner tables. Black pepper: One Chinese vendor was trying to pass off mud flakes as pepper. Green peas: Phony peas have been found in China made of soy, green dye and other questionable substances. Garlic: About one-third of all garlicin the U.S. comes from China. Shop wisely.

How To Easily Kill 98% Of Mold In Your Home I bet you can\u2019t guess which muscle in your body is the #1 muscle that eliminates joint and back pain, anxiety and looking fat. This \u201chidden survival muscle\u201d in your body will boost your energy levels, immune system, sexual function, strength and athletic performance when unlocked. If this \u201chidden\u201d most powerful primal muscle is healthy, we are healthy.  Is it\u2026 Take the quiz above and see if you got the correct answer! P.S. Make sure you check out the next page to get to know the 10 simple moves that will bring vitality back into your life! To begin, I apologize for the dark nature of today's email. However I promise what you'll discover today will be completely worth it. Imagine a rotting corpse draped over your body from head to toe... ...suffocating tissue, restricting blood flow, damaging joints and infecting your healthy cells. Shockingly, that nightmare is a reality for most: 64% of women and 74% of men carry too much body fat according to the National Institutes of Health. It's choking their organs, assaulting their metabolism and sucking their energy dry. But here's the worst part: For most, this bodyfat has become \"calorie-resistant\": It's completely unaffected by even the strictest diets... and most intense exercises. This zombie fat is essentially... \"dead tissue\". That's important for those who have 10, 25 or 50 or more pounds to lose... AND for those who aren't technically overweight, but have what's called \"pocket obesity\"... ...unsightly patches of fat that cling to specific places, like: just above your hips, lower belly, where your butt and legs meet... and even arms, neck and face. However, there's good news: Obesity researchers have now discovered a \"metabolic jumper cable\": It jolts dead bodyfat back to life. This allows your metabolism to burn it as calories and re-energize your entire body. First though, here's the #1 reason why bodyfat becomes calorie-resistant: It lacks blood flow. This has 3 effects: Not enough oxygen or nutrients reach fat cells, so they become unresponsive.. Released fat can't be sent to other tissues to be burned, so fat cells suck it back in... 3) Metabolic hormones carrying the \"burn calories\" message don't reach the fat cell... All this means one thing: Your body can't transform into energy, the 135,000+ of calories the average person stores as fat! You become a metabolic zombie: NO energy to think. NO energy to move. NO energy to motivate. Update: calorie-resistant bodyfat can be now removed... The discovery of this \"metabolic jumper cable\" can now reverse this process: It wakes up un-responsive bodyfat with a powerful calorie-burning hormonal jolt.... It pops open fat cells, sucks out the fat, sending it off before its yanked back in... It shuttles fat to your brain, heart, lungs, kidneys - even your bones - to be burned as energy. Not only do those layers of \"zombie fat\" start coming off, but your entire body just works better. Plus, as your whole body burns more calories, those patches of pocket obesity whittle away. This \"metabolic jumper cable\" isn't any exercise, machine or pill. It's a little-known, calorie-burning hormone we all have... just waiting for the right spark to come alive. It's not thyroid, leptin, ghrelin, insulin, adiponectin, HGH or any other \"fat loss\" hormone you may know. And on this next page, you'll find out precisely how to unleash its calorie-burning power: PS - Studies show that not only can healthy levels of this powerful calorie-burning hormone devour bodyfat and fortify soft muscle, but it can also reduce your risk of diabetes by 53.7%, a heart attack by 83.3% and stroke by 51.4%. Here's more of the scientific proof...  In April, 2009, researchers stunned the medical community when they reported chronic inflammation as the root cause of several major diseases. See, every year 610,000 people in the U.S. die of heart disease. Cancer claims another 584,000...stroke 130,000...Alzheimer's disease nearly 85,000 \u2014 and the list goes on. Truth is, we now know... chronic inflammation is responsible for 7 out of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States! Hundreds of studies and scientific reviews prove it.  Fortunately, newer research shows you can prevent-even reverse-most major diseases by \"turning off\" inflammation. And in our new book, we show you how to do just that. If you or a loved one is suffering from a debilitating condition-and you\"re not sure what the culprit is-now's the time to find out...while you can still do something about it! --&amp;gt; Grab your FREE copy of this groundbreaking soft cover book today (while supplies still last.)

For most us, there are few foods more comforting than bread. Fluffy biscuits, crusty baguettes, flaky croissants\u2026 even a simple slice of toast topped with melted butter can taste like heaven. And that smell\u2026 few scents are quite as pleasant as fresh bread baking in the oven. But there is a lot of confusion as to where bread fits into a healthy diet. The Bible practically commands followers to eat it: \u201cGive us this day our daily bread\u2026\u201d The government put it at the base of the food pyramid. And for centuries, it has been called \u201cthe staff of life.\u201d Of course, there are some who disagree\u2026 Well-known cardiologist, Dr. William Davis, calls wheat \u201cthe perfect chronic poison.\u201d And for a poison, we sure eat lots of it\u2026 The average American consumes 55 pounds of wheat flour every year, making refined flour the #1 source of calories in the American Diet \u2013 a situation that nutrition expert Chris Kresser describes as, \u201ca public health catastrophe.\u201d Is it the perfect poison\u2026 or an essential daily food? Is \u201cgluten-free\u201d bread better for you than regular bread? And can you still eat bread\u2026 while maintaining a lean body and optimal health? The answers to these questions may surprise you! Be sure to read #5 \u2013 the biggest surprise of all!

Then I heard Liz say\u2026 What good is a fat reserve if you can\u2019t burn it? Mind blown. Liz continued: \u201cYou\u2019re drinking smoothies packed with phytonutrients, anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatories that pull toxins out of you like a tractor beam. Allowing your body to burn those toxin-filled fat stores\u2026 and releasing tremendous amounts of stored energy.\u201d So that\u2019s why I\u2019m losing weight without going hungry.

{"text":"New York Times Magazine's Profile of Sean Hannity Missed a Ton of His Conspiracy Theories: Photo Credit: screenshot \/YouTube Toward the end of his 8,000-word New York Times Magazine profile of Sean Hannity -- after touching on image-softening tidbits like how the Fox News host and talk radio host who was once fired for homophobic vitriol says he now has \u201cgay friends\u201d and the revelation that Hannity may have come to believe some of the women who say they were sexually harassed by Roger Ailes after trashing them publicly -- contributing writer Matthew Shaer considered the question of whether it\u2019s possible the conservative media megastar and close adviser to President Donald Trump is actually a paranoid conspiracy theorist. \u201cThe problem for Fox News,\u201d Shaer wrote, \u201cis that while Hannity has risen to become the top ratings-earner of the nightly lineup, he is also a figure prone to barreling headfirst into the murky territory between opinion and out-and-out conspiracy theorism.\u201d After highlighting a Vox.com study that found Hannity to be the \u201cmedia\u2019s top conspiracy theorist\u201d and quoting Hannity rejecting that finding, Shaer appeared to agree with the host. \u201c[T]o watch Hannity regularly is to observe how distant the host is from a figure like the Infowars proprietor Alex Jones,\u201d Shaer concluded. \u201cJones endorses theories; Hannity almost never does, leaving that job to his guests. It is a dance that has the effect of nourishing the more wild-eyed beliefs of his fans while providing Hannity a degree of plausible deniability.\u201d This is not a conclusion that can survive the slightest scrutiny from a regular observer of Hannity\u2019s work. In fact, it is belied by the profile, which depicted Hannity promoting at least three conspiracy theories: that President Barack Obama needed to release his birth certificate to prove he was born in the United States, that Hillary Clinton pushed through the purchase of a uranium mining company by Russia in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation, and that a murdered Democratic National Committee staffer may have been killedbecause he supposedly gave the group\u2019s emails to WikiLeaks. Those are only a handful of the numerous conspiracies and hoaxes Hannity has pushed on his radio and television programs over the years. In fact, Hannity\u2019s entire oeuvre for much of the Trump presidency has been built around a massive, all-encompassing conspiracy theory: That a \u201cDestroy Trump Alliance\u201d composed of the press, the \u201cdeep state,\u201d and critics from both major political parties have united in a coordinated effort to remove the president from office based on what the Fox host deems a \u201cblack-helicopter, tinfoil-hat conspiracy theories about so-called Trump-Russia collusion.\u201d Hannity has detailed this theory in dozens of shows, warning against the depredations of the \u201cdeep state\u201d and the \u201cdeeply corrupt\u201d investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller. On one occasion, Hannity described the nefarious plot as a \u201csoft coup\u201d which he claimed constitutes a \u201cclear and present danger.\u201d If that sounds to you like Hannity endorsing a conspiracy theory, you aren\u2019t alone; The Washington Post\u2019s Erik Wemple described Hannity\u2019s \u201csoft coup\u201d claim as the Fox host \u201cencroaching on Alex Jones territory.\u201d Hannity\u2019s conspiracy theory has several key benefits: It allows Hannity to delegitimize any possible sources of negative information about the Trump administration by tying them into the plot; it encourages his viewers to stick with the president because he is beset by such malicious foes; and, perhaps most importantly, it allows Hannity to shift attention from the possible malfeasance Mueller may discover in his investigation to the question of whether Mueller himself is a criminal running an illegitimate probe who must step down or be fired , as the Fox host has demanded dozens of times. The Times appears to have missed all this. Indeed, for someone claiming to be steeped in Hannity\u2019s work, Shaer appears to have largely ignored Hannity\u2019s discussion of the Russia investigation, perhaps the most important story of the year. The profile does not mention Mueller at all, and references Russia only a handful of times. A few of the dots are there -- the Times writer mentions, for instance, that Hannity\u2019s Seth Rich theory was intended to undermine the case for Russia\u2019s role in hacking the DNC to bolster Trump, and that Hannity views the Uranium One conspiracy as a way to \u201cboomerang\u201d the Russia investigation on Democrats -- he just doesn\u2019t quite pull them together. And given how wild Hannity\u2019s claims have become -- and the potential results they might have if his most powerful fan were to act on him -- that\u2019s a big miss. Report Advertisement Take last night\u2019s edition of Hannity. Monday morning, ABC News reported that the lawyer for Michael Flynn, who served as Trump\u2019s national security adviser until he was forced from office following revelations about his conversations with Russian officials, had met with members of Mueller\u2019s team, potentially to discuss a plea deal which might include Flynn testifying against the president or top White House aides. Mueller reportedly has amassed enough evidence to charge Flynn with federal crimes, and Flynn\u2019s role in several key interactionsinvolving Trump associates and Russia could make him an invaluable witness. But if you were one of the 3-million-plus viewers to turn in to Hannity\u2019s show last night -- perhaps including the president -- you saw him assemble a case aimed at encouraging the audience to disbelieve anything Flynn might say following a plea deal, and instead direct their fire at Mueller\u2019s team. Or, as Fox judicial analyst Gregg Jarrett, a Hannity regular, described them, a \u201ccartel, the equivalent of the Mob\u201d composed of former FBI director James Comey, Mueller, and his team, an \u201cillegal syndicate that\u2019s acting under the guise of the law.\u201d Contra Shaer, Hannity did not just stand by while his guests push conspiracy theories about how Mueller might suborn perjury from Flynn against Trump, he actively participated in constructing them:  SEAN HANNITY: How could this happen in the United States of America, Gregg? This is not a banana republic here. GREGG JARRETT: Because the Department of Justice, and particularly the FBI and Comey and Mueller at the FBI, have turned into this renegade rogue deep state that operates under their own rules. HANNITY: Do they really -- they don't want Manafort. They don't want General Flynn. They want Trump. Report Advertisement JARRETT: Yes. And what I worry about are ruthless prosecutors who suborn perjury. What they do is they make promises and threats to defendants. You\u2019re gonna spend 10 years behind bars unless you sign this statement and the witness says, \u201cbut that's a lie,\u201d and the prosecutor doesn't seem to care. HANNITY: Or I\u2019m gonna go after your son. JARRETT: It's extortion. It's bribery. When they do it it's legal. When you and I do it it's illegal. It's got to stop.  That\u2019s the message going out to Hannity's millions of viewers, perhaps including the president: Trump is being persecuted by an illegal cartel that will do anything and lie to anyone to force the innocent Trump from office. The only plausible deniability Hannity has is that which people like Shaer are willing to grant to him. As for how different Hannity\u2019s show is from Jones\u2019, the nation\u2019s leading 9-11 truther has weighed in on the subject. \u201cSean Hannity is currently the main leader of the resistance against the globalists outside of Trump and then of course myself,\u201d Jones declared in June. \u201cThe Sean Hannity Show, he added in August, \u201cis now The Alex Jones Show.\u201d  Matt Gertz is a Senior Fellow","label":1}
{"text":"Politics \u2014 not as dirty as you think: The success of a marriage nearly always depends on the expectations of the parties going in. If you believe marriage is going to be a rose garden of happy trips to the beach interspersed with moonlight dinners and foot massages, you're more likely to end up cheating on your spouse when that doesn't materialize. If you believe marriage is a mechanism for changing your potential spouse, you likely are to end up estranged. If you believe marriage is about a lifelong union devoted to self-improvement and the creation and rearing of children, you likely are to make decisions that lead to that outcome. Americans don't trust politicians. That's for good reason. Politicians fib to get elected; they pander to particular constituencies; they leave principle at the door in favor of convenience in order to maintain power and position. But they do not, at least not that often, murder people and collude with foreign governments. But thanks to popular culture, that's exactly what many Americans think politicians do. If you watch \"House of Cards,\" you likely are to believe top-level politicians \"off\" each other on a regular basis \u2014 and you might be more willing to believe conspiracy theories about the murder of former Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich. If you've seen \"The Manchurian Candidate,\" you're more likely to believe either former President Obama or President Trump is one. President Trump, who was a layman until he became president, obviously believes a lot of the pop culture mythology surrounding politics. That's why he told Bill O'Reilly it's not that big of a deal Russian President Vladimir Putin kills his political opponents. \"You think our country's so innocent?\" he said in jaw-dropping fashion. That's why Trump believes politics is such a \"dirty business\" \u2014 dirtier, even, than Manhattan real estate, where Trump worked with mafia figures. Politics, in Trump's mind, is the lowest of the low. That means a more corrupt administration. If you believe, as Trump assuredly does, anyone would take a meeting with Russian government figures to dig up dirt on an opponent, then you'll do it, too. Why be martyred just because you were too holy to get down in the mud? If you think Hillary Clinton is the way politics is done \u2014 we shouldn't be outraged because she's just another politician \u2014 then why not play by the same rules? Voters like to believe, as Trump does, politics is filthy because we refuse to acknowledge, in a representative republic, we're the ultimate sources of blame. We keep electing these moral idiots. We keep voting for them, demanding they give us things and suggesting they've \"sold out\" if they don't. We're the ones who decry crony capitalism while complaining the local factory will leave unless the government \"does something.\" Politicians like to believe, as Trump does, politics is sordid because that's a tailor-made excuse for participating in bad behavior. It's also an excuse for legislating morality, as Sen. John McCain tried to do with campaign finance reform \u2014 you can use the public distrust of politicians to restrict the political speech of citizens, all in the name of \"cleaning up the system.\" It always is easier to shift our vision of politics than to shift our vision of ourselves. And so, we get the politics we deserve. Our belief politics is a squalid affair finds realization in our politicians, who reflect that view, and in ourselves as we vote for those politicians. And then, we're surprised when politics seems to grow more and more disreputable.

{"text":"A canceled cruise to Cuba cost this couple hundreds of dollars: A cruise to Cuba is a dream for many people, but there are specific rules that a company must follow and a special certification it needs to run a cruise. When Pamela Gillet booked her dream cruise to Cuba with Pearl Seas Cruises, she assumed the company had secured permission to run the trip it sold her. We consistently advise our readers to do their research, but in this case Gillet needed to go beyond the terms and conditions for the cruise line. She needed to know whether the company had complied with U.S. law. The fact that she didn\u2019t cost her $528. Can we help her get it back? Three weeks prior to her scheduled embarkation date, Gillet had not received final documents, so she called Pearl Seas Cruises. She was told that one cruise had already been canceled, and a second one would also be canceled. The company admitted that it had not received the required certification to sail, but couldn\u2019t tell Gillet for certain if her cruise would sail. TravelInsurance.com makes it fast and easy to compare and buy travel insurance online from top rated providers. Our unbiased comparison engine allows travelers to read reviews, compare pricing and benefits and buy the right policy with a price guarantee, every time. Compare and buy travel insurance now at TravelInsurance.com. One week prior to the embarkation date, Gillet was finally given the bad news: The cruise had been canceled. The company refunded the full amount that Gillet paid for the cruise, but then she requested a refund on the amount she paid for a nonrefundable hotel stay one night before the cruise embarked and nonrefundable flights to Ft. Lauderdale. Approximately 90 days after she requested a refund of these costs, Pearl Seas Cruises told her that her request was \u201cstill under consideration.\u201d While we don\u2019t specifically list contact information for Pearl Seas Cruises (our research team is on it, though), Gillet says she knew that Pearl Seas is owned by American Cruise Lines, and we do list its contact information on our website. I\u2019m not sure ACL would have helped her either, but it might have been worth a try. What might have helped Gillet was researching the company with which she planned to travel, to determine if it had the authority to operate the trips. Travel to Cuba has been problematic for decades. It\u2019s the only country to which U.S. citizens are banned from traveling \u2014 even travel to North Korea isn\u2019t currently banned. Travel to Cuba and the prohibition of financial and commercial transactions by U.S. citizens was enacted in 1963 under President Kennedy. The travel ban was lifted in 2009 when President Obama lifted restrictions for Cuban-Americans, allowing them to visit relatives and provide financial support to their families in Cuba. Americans of non-Cuban descent were still generally prohibited from traveling to the island neighbor. In January 2011, what is now known as the \u201cpeople-to-people\u201d travel rules were enacted, expanding the categories of people who were allowed to travel to Cuba to include U.S. citizens pursuing \u201cpurposeful travel,\u201d including academics, religious groups, students and charities. At this time, most travel to Cuba was through affinity organizations like alumni associations, as well as through churches or cultural groups. After the \u201cdiplomatic thaw\u201d near the end of 2014, travel rules became even more relaxed, allowing Americans to travel to Cuba. In March 2015, MasterCard became the first company to unblock credit card use in Cuba, and later that month the first direct U.S.-Cuba charter flight was operated by Sun Country Airlines. Airbnb began listing rentals around Cuba the following month. Although travel restrictions have clearly relaxed, operating tours to Cuba still requires a People-to-People license. Unlike the other 11 categories of authorized travel to Cuba, the People-to-People license allows any American to legally travel to Cuba, as long as they have a full schedule of activities that enhance contact with Cuban citizens and result in \u201cmeaningful interaction\u201d between American and Cuban citizens. The Pearl Seas Cruises website is clear that its voyages are subject to obtaining the required permissions on its General Information page:  Operation of the planned voyages is subject to obtaining all necessary approvals, permits and licenses from the governments of the U.S. and Cuba. All passengers must comply with U.S. and Cuban laws and regulations related to travel to Cuba.  Cruise companies plan their cruise far in advance because travelers book their travel far in advance. It is common that not all licenses have been granted at the time a cruise is planned and sold, and that\u2019s likely one of many reasons that cruise lines include this clause in their terms and conditions:  PSC reserves the right to change, cancel or substitute any itinerary, vessel, port of call, schedule, tour, excursion or duration of voyage at any time and for any reason whatsoever without prior notice (including reducing or extending days of voyage or continuing or finishing a voyage via other means of transportation) and shall not be liable for any claim whatsoever by Passenger for such change, including, but not limited to, loss, compensation, or refund; except Passenger shall be entitled to (i) a pro rata refund, calculated on a per day basis, of fare actually paid less applicable fees and charges, if a Cruise is cancelled or terminates early, and (ii) a refund of deposit actually paid to PSC for a tour or excursion, if that tour or excursion is cancelled.  Gillet claims that the Pearl Seas Cruises representative recommended arriving one day before the cruise embarkation date, which is good advice \u2014 if your flight is delayed and you miss embarkation you may have to either spend more money to get yourself to the next port or cancel your cruise with no refund. Pearl Seas Cruises offers to book hotel nights and air for their guests, and had Gillet booked her overnight and air through the cruise line, the company likely would have immediately refunded her in full \u2014 or at least offered a credit on a future cruise, when it finally received authorization to operate travel to Cuba. The other option would have been to book refundable air tickets, but most canceled air tickets retain their value for one year after the booking date. Gillet contacted us in an effort to recover the $528 she lost on her nonrefundable hotel room and air tickets. We contacted Pearl Seas Cruises multiple times on her behalf, but it ignored us. It did eventually offer Gillet a $528 credit on another Cuba cruise in 2017, but it took so long for the company to make that offer that Gillet had already booked other travel plans and cannot do another trip this year, so she refused the offer. It\u2019s certainly understandable that travelers prefer to book pre-cruise travel on their own \u2014 often at a cheaper rate \u2014 but as long as cruise lines continue to get away with the \u201cwe can do whatever we want with our itinerary and we don\u2019t owe you anything\u201d clause, if you choose to cruise, it may be best to book your air and additional nights through the cruise line or buy travel insurance from another source (not the cruise line) that will cover itinerary changes, cancellations, and company defaults. We\u2019re sorry we couldn\u2019t help Gillet, but we still hope Pearl Seas Cruises comes to its senses and refunds her money.","label":1}
{"text":"Is Avis\u2019 42 euro \u201creferral\u201d fee in Milan a scam?: Italy\u2019s infamous restricted traffic zones have struck again, this time snagging Douglas Schmucker, an unsuspecting Avis car rental customer. Schmucker doesn\u2019t have a problem with the law, or following the law. Instead, his dispute is with Avis, which he says failed to warn him that its car rental facility in Milan was located in a \u201crestricted\u201d parking zone. And neglecting to disclose that little detail cost him money. AirHelp is the world\u2019s leading flight delays compensation company, helping passengers apply for compensation following a delayed or canceled flight or when boarding has been denied. It is AirHelp\u2019s mission to fight for passenger rights by holding airlines accountable for flights disruptions that are out of passengers\u2019 control. AirHelp has already helped 5 million people, taking the stress out of applying for compensation and making it as hassle-free as possible for travelers around the world. \u201cWe recently received a letter from the legal office of Avis Italia informing us that we received a charge of 42 euros on a credit card to cover the cost of providing our rental information to the parking authority for driving in restricted Zone C in Milan,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were entirely unaware that the Avis location was in a restricted driving zone and the Avis staff made no effort to inform us of that fact.\u201d Actually, Avis does inform customers of the Italian traffic laws, and specifically of the situation in Milan, on its site.  Are there any roads or zones where I need to pay a fee before I can enter? Yes, certain areas, such as the centre of Milan-area C, have congestion charging zones meaning you need to pay a fee if you wish to drive in certain areas, on certain days and during certain times. In addition, there are toll roads and toll bridges which require you to pay a fee if you wish to use them. If you do not pay these charges before you enter such areas or use such roads or bridges, you will incur a fine. We recommend you check the Internet to find out about any restricted areas before you travel. Websites such as www.urbanaccessregulations.eu provide useful information. If the rental location is in or near a restricted area, we will tell you about it when you pick up the vehicle. We are unable to tell you about any other restricted areas.  But who has the time to read all of the fine print? Besides, someone from Avis should have said something to Schmucker, right? \u201cAvis Milan must inform all clients who use the Piazza Diaz office of the need to obtain a permit for the restricted area for pick-up and drop-off of rental vehicle,\u201d he says. \u201cAvis also needs to revisit the 42-euro charge simply for providing clients\u2019 contact info to the municipal authorities.\u201d That\u2019s a point worth underscoring. The 42 euros isn\u2019t the traffic fine \u2014 it\u2019s a referral fee so that Italian authorities can send Schmucker a fine. That\u2019s a hefty price to pay for simply giving authorities a name \u2014 something that is likely automated, anyway. All of which leaves me wondering: Is this a scam? Consider that Avis must know that the location is in a restricted parking zone. While it warns customers in the fine print of its website, it surely knows that most customers will not bother to read it. Let\u2019s assume the actual cost of sending Italian authorities to the name and contact information of its drivers is 2 euros. Isn\u2019t that a little bit like raising the cost of your car rentals by 40 euros? Then again, customers were warned. Avis is just following the law. And maybe, just maybe, it actually costs Avis 42 euros for a referral \u2014 in other words, maybe it isn\u2019t making any money from the transaction. I think you know which way I\u2019m leaning on this one. \u201cThe 42 euro surcharge and the eventual traffic violation costs should be either dismissed or covered by Avis,\u201d says Schmucker. I agree \u2014 that would be the ideal outcome.","label":1}
{"text":"DirecTV Has Americans Cheering After NFL National Anthem Protests: The NFL sparked a massive controversy over the past few days after hundreds of professional football players refused to stand for the national anthem in protest. Although this protesting has been going on since last year, the number of participants drastically increased after President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial remarks; Trump insinuated, a few days prior to Sunday\u2019s games, that the NFL should fire those who take a knee during the anthem. The protests, started by former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in support of Black Lives Matter, were originally created to fight against police brutality and racial injustice. However, several teams, including the Oakland Raiders and Denver Broncos, confirmed that they knelt directly in response to Trump\u2019s comments. Therefore, the protests were no longer about racial injustice, but became an anti-Trump movement. Many Americans were angered by the protesting of the football players and threatened to boycott the NFL altogether because they felt it was disrespecting our American flag and those who serve(d) our country. These apparently were not empty threats. DirecTV announced that they are offering refunds to customers for purchases of the NFL Sunday Ticket if they desire to cancel in relation to the national anthem protesting. Hundreds of people have reportedly called the company in regards to cancellations. This is a big deal since the original policy clearly states that refunds cannot be issued once football season has begun, according to Fox Business. However, DirecTV is making exceptions this season in wake of the major controversy. Americans are praising DirecTV for their bold move. Although the company has not directly said they are against the #TakeAKnee movement, customers appreciate the fact that they are giving their clientele this option. Watch the Fox News Alert below for more information. What do you think about DirecTV refunding customers over the national anthem protesting? Share your thoughts in our Facebook comments. In related news, several restaurants also took a bold stand in the #TakeAKnee movement.","label":0}
{"text":"Young Boy Undergoes Sex Change Three Times and Tragically Suffers: As conservatives have dedicated a notable amount of time trying to stop efforts to let children suffering from gender confusion \u201cchange\u201d their sex, the Left has responded with calls of \u201ctransphobia.\u201d By listening to the Left, you\u2019d think that conservatives were nothing short of inhumane and insensitive, opposing a measure that helps people be comfortable in their own bodies. That's at least the Left's narrative about this supposed struggle for \"equality\" and \"civil rights.\" But nothing can be further from the truth. In fact, the Left\u2019s effort to let children suffering from gender confusion \u201cchange\u201d their sex has created many victims, one of them being 23-year old Brad Cooper, who has \u201cchanged\u201d his sex a reported three times. The Daily Wire reports that Cooper, born a biological male, was allowed by his parents to change his sex at the young age of 15, earning him media praise as Britain\u2019s \u201cyoungest sex-swap patient.\u201d Doctors also agreed with Cooper and his parents that, despite being a biological boy, he was actually a girl trapped in a boy\u2019s body. \u201cDoctors controversially backed her belief she was a girl in a boy\u2019s body,\u201d writes the Daily Wire. \u201cShe was given blockers to stop her going through puberty, followed by injections of female hormones to impede face and chest hair and triggered the formation of breasts.\u201d Despite being hailed a hero by the Jacobin Left, the confused young man then reversed his sex change process at the age of 18. And now, at the young age of 23, Cooper is \u201cchanging\u201d his sex for a third time from a girl back to a boy. Cooper\u2019s gender confusion has impacted him in more ways than the pains of being under continual gender-changing efforts. After undergoing his first sex change effort at the age of 15, Cooper attempted to commit suicide twice. He also got hooked on drugs, and even resorted to prostitution while still a minor, in part to pay for his lavish new female wardrobe. After suffering tragically from his disordered sexuality and painful lifestyle, he decided to stop his hormone treatment and once-more \u201cchange\u201d back to a male, his biological sex. \u201cI made so many mistakes,\u201d remarked Cooper. \u201cOn the surface I was hard as nails, but underneath it hurt like hell. The puberty blockers and hormones made me moody and angry. I was all over the place. My mom supported me, but I moved out and went wild, drinking and taking drugs to cope with being different.\u201d Now Cooper wishes to once more \u201creturn\u201d to be a \u201cwoman.\u201d He claims that being a woman is his true identity, and that one day he wishes to get married and have children. After embracing his biological sex, Cooper remarks that \u201cit just felt wrong.\u201d He continues, \u201cI came to the realization pretty quickly I was doing it because I wanted all the problems associated with being transgender to go away. I was no longer able to hide who I really am. Not for family, or friends or potential boyfriends. I have to be true to myself.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see a bright future for this poor victim,\u201d remarks the Daily Wire. \u201cTransgendered people suffer from an astronomical attempted suicide rate of 40% (eight times the rate of non-trans folk) and are much more likely to experience homelessness.\u201d \u201cMoreover, it\u2019s clear that Cooper\u2019s 15-year-old experience only compounded his problems,\u201d continues the Daily Wire. \u201cUpwards of 80% of children who suffer from gender dysphoria grow out of such confusion before adulthood; should cooper have been cared for as a 15-year-old in a manner that thoroughly addressed the condition psychologically, instead of opting for medical means to \u2018change\u2019 his biological sex, perhaps Cooper would have had a different future.\u201d Rather than criticizing Cooper, who is clearly suffering, perhaps the best thing we can do is pray for him \u2013 pray that he abandons his disordered sexual proclivities and finds peace. Cooper, too, is a creation of God and a human being with inherent dignity who deserves a good life. In other news, Planned Parenthood is encouraging parents to let their kids \u201cchoose\u201d their gender identity. In fact, they recently released a shocking report to parents, telling moms and dads that what they thought they knew about parenting might be wrong. You can read more about this here.","label":1}
{"text":"Jimmy Kimmel Tears Into Fox &amp; Friends Co-Host: 'You Phony Little Creep': Jimmy Kimmel on Wednesday fired back at Senator Bill Cassidy, as well as Fox  ; Friends\u2018 Brian Kilmeade, for belittling his impassioned health care monologue. The ABC late-night host made headlines on Tuesday for taking aim at Senators Cassidy and Lindsey Graham\u2019s attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. In response, Kilmeade referred to the late-night host as a Hollywood elitist pushing his political agenda on the rest of the country. \u201cThe reason I found this comment to be particularly annoying is because this is a guy who, whenever I see him, kisses my ass,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cOh, he\u2019s such a fan\u2026 He follows me on Twitter; he asked me to write a blurb for his book, which I did; he calls my agent looking for projects. He\u2019s dying to be a member of the Hollywood elite. The only reason he\u2019s not a member of the Hollywood elite is because nobody will hire him to be one. \u201cYou know, the reason I\u2019m talking about this is because my son had an open-heart surgery, then has to have two more, and because of that I learned that there are kids with no insurance in the same situation,\u201d Kimmel continued. \u201cI don\u2019t get anything out of this, Brian, you phony little creep.\u201d Kilmeade responded to Kimmel on Thursday\u2019s edition of Fox  ; Friends, saying, \u201cLast night, Jimmy Kimmel personally attacked me.\u201d He continued, \u201cI hope your son gets better\u201d and \u201cgets all the care he needs,\u201d missing Kimmel\u2019s point that it isn\u2019t his son that would be affected by the bill, but millions of other children whose parents aren\u2019t able to cover their medical costs. Kilmeade then suggested that Kimmel speak directly with Cassidy and Graham. (Kimmel, of course, already spoke with Cassidy, who appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live after the host revealed that his son was sick.) UPDATE: Kilmeade once again addressed Kimmel\u2019s comments on his Fox News radio show, defending himself against \u2014 of all things \u2014 the idea that he ever wanted a career in Hollywood. \u201cFor him to go out and attack me personally, and try to get into my personality, saying, \u2018He wants to be a Hollywood celebrity\u2019? I\u2019ve never\u2026 Why would I ever leave the number one network in all of cable\u2026 to get out to Los Angeles and do entertainment? I mean, what\u2026 what point is that? \u2018No one will hire him\u2019? It\u2019s not even based in fact.\u201d The rant, which lasted nearly seven minutes, also found Kilmeade taking umbrage with Kimmel suggesting that he was short. (Yes, really!) \u201cI guess you said, \u2018this little man,\u2019 or something like that. I\u2019m 5\u201910, 174 pounds. Sorry that\u2019s not good enough for you, but I just think if you look at the average chart of a male in America, I think I\u2019m pretty much on target.\u201d Kudos? Adding fuel to the fire, Sen. Cassidy on Wednesday suggested to CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo that Kimmel simply \u201cdoes not understand\u201d the bill at all. \u201cOh, I get it. I don\u2019t understand because I\u2019m a talk show host, right?\u201d Kimmel asked, sarcastically. Then, after listing over a dozen major health care organizations that \u201cvehemently oppose the bill,\u201d the late-night host suggested that perhaps the problem is that \u201cI do understand, and you got caught with your G-O-Penis out. \u201cI don\u2019t want to turn this into a Kanye-and-Taylor-Swift-type situation, but when Senator Cassidy was on my show in May, he told me that he believed that every American family regardless of income should be able to get quality health care, and I believed he was sincere,\u201d Kimmel continued. \u201cSadly, the bill he unveiled last week with Senator Lindsey Graham indicates that he was not sincere.

{"text":"Trump Jr. calls charge of collusion 'ridiculous': Trump Jr. allowed Tuesday night in an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News Channel that \"he has probably met with other people from Russia\" but insisted that he did not attempt to coordinate to impact the election or try to damage Hillary Clinton. He repeatedly suggested that the charges of collusion were \"ridiculous\" and \"overplayed\" and insisted that his father knew nothing about the June 2016 meeting. \"It was such a nothing there was nothing to tell\" his father, said Trump Jr. Donald Trump Jr. eagerly accepted help from what was described to him as a Russian government effort to aid his father's campaign with damaging information about Hillary Clinton, according to the emails. The email exchange posted to Twitter by President Donald Trump's eldest son shows him conversing with a music publicist who wanted him to meet with a lawyer from Moscow. The publicist describes the lawyer as a \"Russian government attorney\" who has dirt on Clinton as \"part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\" In one response, Trump Jr. says he would \"love\" to hear more. President Donald Trump says his eldest son is \"a high-quality person,\" and he applauds \"his transparency.\" In a tweet Tuesday night, the president promoted his son's appearance on Fox News and called him a \"great person who loves our country.\"  My son, Donald, will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10:00 P.M. He is a great person who loves our country!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2017  White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders read a brief statement from the president Tuesday in response to revelations that Trump Jr. agreed to hear damaging information on Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government's effort to help his father. Trump Jr., who was deeply involved in his father's presidential campaign, released the emails along with a statement describing the disclosure as an effort \"to be totally transparent.\" The emails with publicist Rob Goldstone show that Trump Jr. was told that the Russian government had information that could \"incriminate\" Clinton and her dealings with Russia.  Here's my statement and the full email chain pic.twitter.com\/x050r5n5LQ\u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2017  The messages were the latest disclosure to roil the ongoing investigation into potential coordination between Trump's campaign and Russia, which U.S. intelligence agencies have said sought to influence the outcome of the election in Trump's favor. As congressional committees and Special Counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, investigate, the emails will almost certainly be reviewed for any signs of potential campaign collusion with the Kremlin, which the White House has repeatedly denied. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment on the emails, citing the ongoing investigation.  Here is page 4 (which did not post due to space constraints). pic.twitter.com\/z1Xi4nr2gq\u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2017  In the emails, Goldstone wrote to Trump Jr. that the information \"would be very useful to your father.\" Goldstone was working to connect Trump Jr. to Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, who later met with Trump Jr. in New York at Trump Tower. Veselnitskaya has denied that she ever worked for the Russian government and said on Tuesday that she doesn't represent the Russian government, only herself. She also said she \"couldn't have had\" information on Hillary Clinton. \"If it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer,\" Trump Jr. replied to Goldstone in one of a series of email exchanges the younger Trump posted to Twitter. The emails, dated early June, show Goldstone telling Trump that singer Emin Agalarov and his father, Moscow-based developer Aras Agalarov, had \"helped along\" the Russian government's support for Trump. The elder Agalarov was involved with Trump in hosting the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. The two men also had preliminary discussions about building a Trump Tower in Moscow that fell through. Trump also appeared in a music video with the younger Agalarov. Goldstone at one point said he could send the information to Trump's father first directly \"via Rhona,\" an apparent reference to the elder Trump's longtime assistant Rhona Graff. The email release followed days of evolving accounts from Trump Jr. about the nature of the meeting and its purpose. The president's son posted the emails only after they were obtained by The New York Times. On Saturday, Trump Jr. described the encounter as being a \"short introductory meeting\" focused on the disbanded program that had allowed American adoptions of Russian children. Moscow ended the adoptions in response to Magnitsky Act sanctions created in response to alleged human rights violations in Russia. A day later, Trump Jr. changed his account, acknowledging that he was told beforehand that Veselnitskaya might have information \"helpful\" to the Trump campaign, and was told by her during the meeting that she had something about Clinton. In his third description of what occurred, on Tuesday, Trump Jr. said he had believed the information he would hear about Clinton would be political opposition research. He said that he first wanted to speak by phone, but that when that didn't work out, he was told that the attorney would be in New York \"and I decided to take the meeting.\" \"The woman, as she has said publicly, was not a government official,\" Trump Jr. said in the Tuesday statement. \"And, as we have said, she had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act.\" The Trump Organization has confirmed the authenticity of Trump Jr. posts on Twitter releasing the email chain.

Sources inform \"Globes\" that over the past year, the tax authority in the Fifth Republic founded a special department for dealing with French Jews. The department currently has 20 Hebrew-speaking employees, and is in the process of hiring five more. This extraordinary department is one of a kind. Tax authorities do not usually establish departments targeting a specific nationality or religion. The action is astonishing, especially when the country involved is France, which is constitutionally defined as a secular republic that refrains from \"marking\" people according to their religion. Tax authorities around the world do establish teams to deal with sectors whose tax reporting is questionable. They target a specific market when there is concern that it contains a large amount of unreported capital, such as the real estate market or the diamond market. Setting up a specific department dealing with a designated nationality or religion, however, is not an accepted practice. The only \"department\" ostensibly close in character to this secret French department is a new department established in the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for dealing with cases of Israelis, American-Israelis, and Americans with assets and money in Israel. This US department, however, resulted from the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) signed by Israel and the US, in which huge amounts of information are transferred by the countries about their taxpayers, and someone has to handle that information. This was not the purpose for which the department was set up in the French tax authority. The French department was established to handle French Jewish tax evaders, and hired employees with professional experience and a profound understanding of Israeli law in order to examine whether Jews were using these laws to evade tax in France. The aim of the department is to catch French tax evaders using Israel as a tax shelter. Examining real estate deals An international lawyer specializing in taxation who is familiar with the secret department says, \"It is very, very irregular to hire 20 Hebrew-speaking employees, or any other language, in a foreign tax authority. Most tax authorities have one or two Hebrew-speakers, and there are English or French-speaking employees in Israel for the purpose of signing conventions and conducting relations with the tax authorities of other countries. Every tax authority has employees that speak a foreign language, but hiring 20 or more Hebrew-speaking investigators is very irregular.\" The lawyer adds that he learned from his acquaintance with the department and its employees that some of the employees hired previously lived in Israel. \"They hired Hebrew-speaking French people, some of whom previously lived in Israel and moved back to France,\" he told Globes. According to information obtained by Globes, as part of the department's activity, its employees take out Land Registry extracts in Israel for the purpose of examining deals contracted in Israel and reaching French residents who have acquired properties here. The investigators have mapped the main streets in various cities in Israel, including Tel Aviv, Herzliya, Ra'anana, Netanya and Jerusalem, in which many purchases by Jewish residents of France take place. They have obtained Land Registry extracts and examined the particulars of a deal in order to detect foreign passport numbers. The investigators cross-referenced the information with information in their databases and the reports by those French Jews about their assets and income. In cases in which it was found that the person did not report the properties he bought in Israel, he was also summoned for questioning. Sources inform Globes that a French Jew recently went to the secret department for an \"audit\" without knowing exactly what was to be discussed. For safety's sake, he took his lawyer with him - a fact that proved extremely important for him. During the discussion about his declarations of his assets and funds, the questioners very quickly presented a Land Registry extract including all of the French Jewish client's housing units in Israel. The discussion took place, and at the end, the lawyer wondered in what framework the new investigation was taking place. A seemingly innocent casual conversation in the corridor with one of the investigators revealed the amazing fact that a special department for dealing with French Jews and their tax evasion was involved. Targeting immigrants to Israel from France, French Jewry boosts demand for Israeli homes not because of antisemitism, but for love of Israel. Through the special division, in addition to mapping the properties of French people in Israel, the tax authority in France has begun direct interrogations of Jewish residents of France who are in the midst of immigrating to Israel, and examining whether they possess money or assets that they did not previously declare, and whether this is the reason why they decided to immigrate to Israel. Democrats Want This Video Erased From The Internet. Watch Before It's Gone According to figures from the Israel Ministry of Immigration and Absorption, i mmigration from Francehas increased dramatically in recent years. 1,211 new immigrants arrived in Israel from France in the first half of 2017. A study conducted at Bar-Ilan University showed that the economic benefit for the Israeli economy from the absorption of Jews from France would reach $65 billion. The study assumes that 100,000 immigrants will arrive from France by 2026. These figures are surprising to no one. Massive purchases of properties in Israel by French people have been spoken of for years, some by immigrants and some not, and a number of international investigations were opened against French people on suspicion of tax offenses and evasion on an enormous scale in France and laundering money in Israel through real estate purchases. These developments apparently attracted the attention of the French tax authority, which decided to target French Jews. The sources also told Globes that the French tax authority is one of the main tax authorities that contacts the Israel Tax Authority in order to obtain information about French residents with exceptionally large assets in Israel, compared with other countries, but many of the requests are rejected. \"They call the Israel Tax Authority almost every day with requests for information about some person or other, but many of the requests are rejected, because they do not meet the conditions of the conventions on exchanges of information. \"They are just fishing,\" says a source involved in information exchanges between the two countries. The French embassy in Israel said in response, \"In the framework of the campaign against tax evasion, the authorities in France conduct investigations concerning individual cases, in accordance with the international agreements. The authorities in France deny the existence of a special department. It is extremely important to state that the things that were written are false. \"Taxes in France are calculated according to risk considerations. There is therefore no connection whatsoever to the national affiliation or ethnic origin of taxpayers. Next year, automatic exchanges of information are scheduled between OECD member countries.\" \u00a92017 the Globes (Tel Aviv, Israel) Distributed by Tribune Content Agency.

Her face was unrecognizable after the brutal attack. The attackers turned themselves into police, two hours after the initial attack. They confessed to the crime. The attackers justified their attack by telling police that they \u201cdidn\u2019t like the victim\u2019s attitude\u201d.  \u201cWe hit her because we didn\u2019t like the way she talked and her attitude.\u201d \u2014 Attackers  The victim\u2019s mother made a statement on her Facebook and uploaded photos of her daughter, after the attack. It wasn\u2019t the first time she was attacked.  \u201cMy daughter was beaten up a second time and her face is now a mess. They say the reason was because they wanted revenge for the last time we reported them. Two months ago, a boy she knew contacted her. He was [one of the attacker\u2019s] boyfriend. She was beaten up for picking up his call, and now she was beaten up for reporting the first attack. Her forehead is bloated like there\u2019s silicon in it.

I have an audio recording too, so don\u2019t say she wasn\u2019t injured too badly. My baby can\u2019t even eat congee\u2026.

However, the 13-year-old is protected under Juvenile Law and will not be detained, but can still face charges.

Sees Black Spot in Distance Start Swimming Toward Them: When the Nikitina family went on vacation this summer, they had no idea it would end in bringing home a new family member. During a fun day on the Black Sea full of sailing and swimming, they ventured out way beyond the mainland.

{"text":"Is Illegal Immigration Responsible for the Decline in Labor Force Participation?: Why are prime-age men dropping out of the labor force? And what can we do about it? A few days ago the Two Jasons tackled this question and came up with very different answers. Here is Jason Richwine criticizing Jason Furman:  How about restricting low-skill immigration to encourage recruitment of Americans? No, Furman says, because \u2014 well, actually, he does not mention immigration at all, not even to dismiss its importance. Omitting the i-word in discussions of labor-force dropout is an unfortunate habit on both the left and the right. Amy Wax and I wrote our Inquirer op-ed (based on a much longer essay in American Affairs) to show that employers turned to immigrants as the native work ethic declined. As evidence, we point both to the much higher labor-force participation of low-skill immigrants compared to low-skill natives, as well as to the near-universal preference expressed by employers for immigrant labor. Restricting the flow of foreign workers would generate a major incentive for business owners, politicians, and opinion leaders to reintegrate American men into the labor force. It is, in our opinion, a crucial part of any reform strategy.  I don\u2019t have a huge dog in this fight since, by lefty standards anyway, I\u2019m pretty open to policies that humanely restrict illegal immigration. But I have a couple of questions for Jason R that I\u2019m genuinely interested in. First, there\u2019s this: Labor force participation of women rose steadily starting with the feminist revolution of the 60s. However, participation peaked in the late 90s and has been declining ever since. In other words, for the past couple of decades this is a problem that\u2019s not restricted just to men. Is illegal immigration affecting the labor force participation of women the same way? Second, if illegal immigration really is a factor, then labor force participation of native workers should be correlated with the amount of illegal immigration. But it doesn\u2019t seem to be: I don\u2019t want to make too much of this, since the Great Recession obviously had a big impact on both illegal immigration rates and labor force participation. Still, overall labor participation turned down in 2000 and then turned down even more in 2009. But illegal immigration rates didn\u2019t change in 2000, and then changed in the wrong direction in 2009. Lower immigration rates should have increased labor force participation. What\u2019s more, labor force participation among men has been dropping steadily since the 60s, with the rate hardly changing at all even as illegal immigration has spiked up and down. There are so many other, bigger factors that affect labor force participation that I don\u2019t really expect much from this comparison. But I\u2019d expect at least a glimmer of something if unauthorized workers from Mexico really are causing native workers to just give up on the job market. Why don\u2019t we see anything?","label":1}
{"text":"The Trump Administration Just Proposed a New Way to Screw Over the States That Supported Him: Mother Jones illustration President Trump has long championed himself as a hero of America\u2019s working class. But, as my colleague Noah Lanard highlighted back in September, Trump\u2019s praise of the American worker is spoiled by how rapidly his Labor Department has pursued policies, like working to roll back overtime eligibility for millions of workers and delaying a requirement that financial advisers actually act in their clients\u2019 best interests, that would further diminish their already-dwindling wages. And earlier this month, the administration took another step toward making things even worse for low-wage workers with a proposed a rule change that will allow employers to pool the tips their employees earn (think servers at a restaurant) and share them with their untipped coworkers (think cooks and dishwashers). In a press release announcing the rule change, the Department of Labor claims \u201cthe proposal would help decrease wage disparities between tipped and non-tipped workers.\u201d But here\u2019s the rub: The rule doesn\u2019t actually require that employers share those tips with untipped staff. Under the proposal, employers can pocket those tips as long as workers earn the minimum wage. In fact, the Department of Labor all but openly acknowledges that the change could lead to this scenario: \u201cThe proposed rule rescinds those portions of the 2011 regulations that restrict employer use of customer tips when the employer pays at least the full Federal minimum wage.\u201d Now, the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) has a new report that totally debunks the Trump administration\u2019s argument that the move will decrease wage disparities. Far from boosting the stagnating wages of workers, the rule change would in fact clear the path for rampant wage theft in an industry already wracked by the practice, just as worker advocates have warned.According to EPI\u2019s estimates, employers across the country are likely to pocket $5.8 billion worth of employees\u2019 wages if the rule goes through, in addition to an estimated $50 billion in wage theft already occurring nationwide. And, as it turns out, many of the states who stand to lose the most from the change will be those that went for Trump. \u201cThe states that have the weakest labor protections tend to be the states that vote Republican in presidential elections,\u201d David Cooper, a senior economic analyst with EPI and co-author of the report, tells Mother Jones. \u201cSo this is just another example of the Trump administration\u2019s policies screwing over the very people he claims to be fighting for.\u201d The EPI researchers clustered states based on the level of protection their laws afford to the earnings of tipped employees. According to their analysis, 28 states fall into what basically translates into the least protective category, meaning they do the poorest job of making sure that employees\u2019 tips make it home with them. These are the states most vulnerable to the rule change. (Some of that vulnerability stems from them falling outside of enforcement guidelines flowing from rulings in the 4th and 10th circuit.) Of the 28 states, 19 broke for Trump in 2016. In 11 of those states\u2014Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Tennessee\u2014Trump won by double digits. EPI estimates that in these 28 states, anywhere from 4.1 percent to 100 percent of tips will be pocketed by employers. In other words, tipped workers across those states could lose between $385 million to $9.6 billion in wages. The EPI\u2019s current prediction, or \u201cpreferred estimate\u201d: a staggering 43.91 percent of potentially transferred tips, or $4.2 billion, will be shifted from employees to bosses. \u201cThis is particularly brazen and really disheartening for workers in those states [that voted for Trump],\u201d Cooper says. \u201cIf their employer is cheating them, many of these states defer their wage theft enforcement capabilities to the federal government. So if I was in one those states and thought my employer was cheating me, I wouldn\u2019t even have recourse within the state government to seek damages. I\u2019d have to go to the Feds, and what Trump is essentially doing is saying that at the federal level, he\u2019s going to legalize employers stealing from their workers.\u201d The rule is currently under consideration, and due to enormous pressure from worker advocates and Democratic lawmakers, is now in the middle of an extended 60 day public comment period.

{"text":"Trump Is Going Ballistic Against Journalists. What Is He So Afraid Of?: Throughout Donald Trump\u2019s first year as president, I\u2019ve kept a running record of his authoritarian behavior titled \u201cTrumpocracy.\u201d A major component of this now very lengthy document has been his ceaseless attack on the American news media. But although Trump\u2019s rants against reporting he dislikes are at this point extremely familiar (or daresay, normal), his assault on the free press has intensified in recent days. For Trump, if it\u2019s not Fox News then it\u2019s Fake News\u2014and that now means war on a very personal level. Over the past two weeks, Trump has singled out no fewer than four individual journalists for bullying and ridicule, while his press secretary has threatened a fifth: CNN\u2019s Don Lemon: Blasting a \u201cfailing New York Times\u201d report about his TV-viewing habits, Trump denied that he watches much CNN and highlighted for the public that he calls the CNN anchor \u201cthe dumbest man on television!\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Dave Weigel: When Weigel tweeted a misinterpretation of a crowd photo from a Trump rally in Pensacola, Florida on Friday, Trump called him out and demanded an apology and retraction from the \u201cFake News WaPo.\u201d After Weigel quickly issued a correction and apology, Trump attacked him again, alleging Weigel\u2019s mistake was intentional and declaring that he should be fired. ABC News\u2019 Brian Ross: After the investigative correspondent made a significant error, soon corrected, about Trump\u2019s interactions with his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Trump blasted Ross for \u201chis horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia, Russia, Russia Witch Hunt.\u201d Trump went on to call Ross a \u201cfraudster,\u201d blamed him for a big drop in the stock market that was allegedly due to the erroneous report, and urged the public to sue ABC for financial damages. MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough: A previous target of the president\u2019s ire, the morning show host and fierce Trump critic came under attack again after NBC\u2019s firing of Matt Lauer over sexual misconduct, with Trump dredging up a baseless conspiracy theory about the \u201cunsolved mystery\u201d of a young intern who died in Scarborough\u2019s congressional office in 2001. CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta: Another previous Trump target, Acosta reported on Tuesday that he was threatened by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders: He might be blocked from doing future coverage, she told him, if he asked Trump during a bill signing about a degrading tweet against Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. Meanwhile, during this same period, Trump repeatedly praised content from State Television Fox News and personally promoted a new book by a Fox host\u2014part of another long-term pattern:  Day 322: Trump urges the public to \u201cgo get the new book\u201d by \u201cFox  ; Friends\u201d host Brian Kilmeade, adding to a list of partisan supporters whose commercial products Trump has personally endorsed as president including Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity (see Nov. 14), Fox regular Sheriff David Clarke (see Aug. 27), and others. (Dec. 7)  Trump also recently attacked the credibility of CNN International, no doubt to the delight of the multiple autocrats and dictators he\u2019s praised from around the world.  It's not CNN's job to represent the U.S to the world. That's yours. Our job is to report the news. #FactsFirst ? \u2014 CNN Communications (@CNNPR) November 25, 2017  That disparagement of a major global outlet for American news reporting came just two weeks after Trump shared a laugh with President Rodrigo Duterte as the Philippines strongman mocked journalists as \u201cspies.\u201d (Trump pulled a similar move in July with Vladimir Putin.) And Trump\u2019s tirades against \u201cfake news\u201d are having a global impact, as the Times\u2019 Steven Erlanger reported this week, emboldening unsavory regimes: After CNN aired video in November that showed a migrant in Libya being auctioned as a slave, Libyan leaders responded by citing Trump\u2019s attacks against CNN in an effort to undermine the network\u2019s reporting. Trump\u2019s stepped-up assault dovetails with a rising wave of attacks by Fox News and other unabashedly pro-Trump outlets against the Mueller investigation. Trump has never stopped building on his declaration shortly after his inauguration that the media is the \u201cenemy of the American people.\u201d (That Stalin-esque comment was the uppercut to his former chief of staff Steve Bannon\u2019s initial jab that the media was \u201cthe opposition party\u201d and should \u201ckeep its mouth shut.\u201d) But the stepped-up blows now\u2014which have further included Trump bashing the press as \u201ca stain on America\u201d and proposing a competition among TV networks for a \u201cFAKE NEWS TROPHY\u201d\u2014are also no coincidence. Most of the vitriol has followed the announcement of a plea deal between the disgraced Flynn and special counsel Robert Mueller, whose investigation into all things Trump-Russia has since surely struck fear into the White House. Trump\u2019s impulse to punch back even harder at the press also dovetails with a rising wave of attacks by Fox News and other unabashedly pro-Trump outlets against the Mueller investigation. As Trump seethes that the FBI is \u201cin tatters,\u201d Fox pundits liken the bureau, perhaps with a touch of projection, to \u201cthe old KGB that comes for you in the dark of night.\u201d As Trump mocks the US \u201cJustice\u201d Department for allegedly failing to prosecute his former presidential opponent more than a year later, Fox pundits fervently demand the arrest of top FBI and DOJ officials. Trump echoed such propagandizing in his speech in Pensacola last Friday, denouncing his perceived enemies among a \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201crigged\u201d system in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cThere are powerful forces in Washington trying to sabotage our movement,\u201d he inveighed. \u201cThese are bad people. These are very, very bad and evil people. They know who they are\u2026.They will lie and leak and smear because they don\u2019t want to accept the results of an election where we won by a landslide.\u201d Who knows whether Trump really views his presidency as fodder for a daily television show, as the Times recently reported in a piece citing 60 sources. But of course, what\u2019s at stake with Trump\u2019s unprecedented war on reported facts could not be more starkly real-world. The danger of ill-informed fear and panic that could potentially arise from, say, a president subverting the mainstream media less than two hours after a terrorist attack on an American city, as Trump did on Monday, is disturbing to ponder. Where Trump\u2019s information warfare will take the country remains an open, if unsettling question: As journalists have risen to the challenge of his lies and attacks, recent polling suggests the American public has greater confidence in the Fourth Estate than in the Trump White House, though that attitude appears less to straddle a sharp partisan divide. But part of this equation is already clear. Trump loathes media he views as unfavorable to him\u2014and he won\u2019t hesitate to further weaponize that contempt against a pillar of American democracy.","label":1}
{"text":"L\u2019Affaire Moore, &amp;c.: (Reuters photo: Marvin Gentry) The tragedy in Alabama, the tragedy in Venezuela, the arrogance of presidents, a medal ceremony in the Persian Gulf, and more If you\u2019re Roy Moore\u2019d out, I don\u2019t blame you. But I\u2019d like to make a few Moore points nonetheless. (I didn\u2019t mean that as a pun, I really didn\u2019t.) From what he has said over the years, Moore regards the 9\/11 attacks as punishment for America\u2019s sins. I wonder whether he sees his current predicament in a similar light. It would be interesting to see him address this at some point (after the election, surely). \u2010A lot of good Alabamians, no doubt, contributed to Moore\u2019s charity, the Foundation for Moral Law. (Wonderful name, wonderful concept.) He ripped them off, using the foundation as a personal piggy bank. And now he has ripped them off in another way, you could say: He has embarrassed them and the \u201ccause.\u201d For years and years \u2014 ever since the Scopes trial in the 1920s \u2014 the religious Right has tried to escape the stigma of Gantryism. And time after time, the Roy Moores \u2014 the Jimmy Swaggarts, the Jim Bakkers, the Falwell Juniors \u2014 kill them. At least that\u2019s the way I see it \u2026 \u2010Nigel Farage was one of the many people who rallied for Roy Moore in the Alabama primary. (The Right welcomes foreign interference, at least some of the time!) He saw the primary in a global light. Support of Moore, he said, was \u201cimportant for the whole global movement across the West that we have built up and we have fought for.\u201d (Farage had just been in Germany, campaigning for that country\u2019s alt-Right \u2014 a literal alt-Right, known as the AfD, which stands for \u201cAlternative f\u00fcr Deutschland.\u201d) Has \u201cthe whole global movement\u201d been harmed by the Moore affair? \u2010Farage was doing his radio show the other day \u2014 a call-in show. In called Ahmed from Leyton, who had a point to make: People were talking about the Kremlin\u2019s influence on America, but what about AIPAC (the American Israel Public Affairs Committee) and Israel? A good point, said Farage. \u201cThere are about 6 million Jewish people living in America, so as a percentage it\u2019s quite small, but in terms of influence it\u2019s quite big.\u201d Wrapping up, Farage thanked his \u201cnew caller from Leyton\u201d and said, \u201cHe makes the point that there are other very powerful lobbies in the United States of America, and the Jewish lobby, with its links with the Israeli government, is one of those strong voices.\u201d Get the difference: The Kremlin is a foreign government, interfering in American elections; the \u201cJewish lobby\u201d is composed of Americans, petitioning their government. And what is the largest pro-Israel lobby in the United States? Christians United for Israel, with more than 2 million members. Perhaps Mr. Farage could mention them the next time he is highlighting the Jewish influence on America. \u2010While we\u2019re on the subject: A man posing as a Washington Post reporter was trolling around Alabama. He was offering cash in exchange for dirt on Roy Moore. Between $5,000 and $7,000! He was trying to discredit the Post\u2019s reporting, of course. And what was he calling himself? \u201cBernie Bernstein.\u201d Interesting. Wonder if the name was chosen at random. Could just as easily have been \u201cJohn Smith,\u201d right? Or even \u201cLucy Hickenlooper.\u201d (This was the real name of Olga Samaroff, the pianist who married Leopold Stokowski, the conductor, who was also married to Gloria Vanderbilt, who is Anderson Cooper\u2019s mother.) \u2010Have you seen the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro video? It\u2019s great. Maduro, the boss of Venezuela, had already been criticized for gaining weight in the midst of a food crisis. Venezuelans are starving. Maduro was giving a speech on live television. After he finished, he reached into his desk and pulled out an empanada, which he readily chomped. The cameras were still rolling. \u201cNot a good look,\u201d as they say on Twitter. To see it, go here. \u2010We on the right often criticized President Obama for his arrogance, among other things. We often quoted something he said in 2008, when he was running: \u201cI think that I\u2019m a better speechwriter than my speechwriters. I know more about policies on any particular issue than my policy directors. And I\u2019ll tell you right now that I\u2019m gonna think I\u2019m a better political director than my political director.\u201d I thought of that when listening to President Trump \u2014 who was asked about all the vacancies at the State Department. \u201cLet me tell you, the one that matters is me. I\u2019m the only one that matters.\u201d (This is a cousin of \u201cL\u2019Etat, c\u2019est moi.\u201d) Here is Trump again: \u201cThe reason our stock market is so successful is because of me. I\u2019ve always been great with money.\u201d This puts Obama in the shade, I think. \u2010Bernie Sanders (not \u201cBernie Bernstein\u201d) tweeted this: \u201cWe are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. How is it possible that 2 months after Hurricane Maria half the people of Puerto Rico don\u2019t have electricity?\u201d The senator may be right about Puerto Rico: that reconstruction is going way too slow. I don\u2019t know, as I have not studied the issue. But I think I know this: If we are, indeed, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, it\u2019s because we have steadfastly rejected the system that Senator Sanders would impose on us. \u2010The Virginia gubernatorial race seems a thousand years ago, I know. But I\u2019d like to mention this: The GOP gave the impression that they liked immigrants less than Confederates. This is, I think, a bad impression. How can you propose a sensible immigration policy, and staunchly oppose illegal immigration, without coming off as anti-immigrant? For one thing, you can point out that immigration has been a boon to this country. To us all. We owe our very presence here to immigration. That is not too elementary to point out. And it might make the \u201cmedicine\u201d of restrictionism go down better. \u2010A musician friend of mine writes something funny (maybe inadvertently so): \u201cHow is \u2018molto moderato\u2019 not a contradiction? What the hell does it mean?\u201d \u201cVery moderate.\u201d Heh. True. Kind of a puzzler. I think it might mean \u201cdeterminedly moderato. Don\u2019t you budge from it!\u201d \u2010I learned something, and saw something, via Tom Gross. The video is here. A big international judo competition was held in Abu Dhabi. Israelis participated \u2014 though they were the only participants forbidden to attach their national flag to their clothing. One of them, Tal Flicker, won a gold medal. At the medal ceremony, flags of the place-finishers were raised. But not the Israeli flag. In its place \u2014 the gold-medal position \u2014 was the flag of the International Judo Federation. The Israeli national anthem (\u201cHatikvah\u201d) was not played. In its place was the anthem of the International Judo Federation. (Who knew?) There on the stand, the gold medalist sang his national anthem anyway. \u201cThe anthem that they played from the world federation was just background noise,\u201d he later said. \u201cI was singing \u2018Hatikvah\u2019 from my heart.\u201d So great, so great. \u2010I returned to the United States from abroad the other day. There were two lines at the airport: \u201cU.S.\u201d and \u201cNon-U.S.\u201d Oh, give me a break. \u201cNon-U.S.\u201d! People are terrified to say \u201cforeign.\u201d Remember when Ted Turner forbade CNN to say \u201cforeign\u201d? You had to say \u201cinternational\u201d (which has a different meaning). Golf announcers, announcing PGA Tour events, speak of foreign players as \u201cinternational players.\u201d Oh, you mean the guy holds multiple passports? He\u2019s from Trieste or something? So silly, so unnecessary. Anthony Daniels \u2014 a.k.a. Theodore Dalrymple \u2014 says that he likes being a foreigner: He likes the status of foreigner, he likes being in countries not his own. Anyone can understand this. \u2010Earlier this week, I passed a restaurant called \u201cMexicue.\u201d Now, I love Mexican food and barbecue above most things on earth. What about the combination? Heaven? Or more like a hell? Two great things are not necessarily great combined. (Fruit and chocolate, my sister would argue, and I tend to agree.)

{"text":"Letters to the Editor: Liberals to blame for mass murderers: Buy Now Who is really to blame for these mass murderers? In the aftermath of the terrible loss of life and so many people hurt, the question has been why? But the real question people should ask is, why not? The good, decent Christian morals and values that this country is built upon have been attacked and erased by the liberal left. So ultimately some godless, gutless, slime ball is going to think, why not? It\u2019s Liberals who have attacked the gospel underpinnings of this nation, creating a society where unborn babies are considered non-human organisms that can be butchered and killed as they see fit. Perverts who raised their children to be transsexual used to be put in jail. Now Liberals and the liberal media lift them up as wonderful and desirable. And anyone who opposes even this are they themselves considered to be evil and hated by Liberals. So within this godless vacuum, some think why not? So thank you to the Liberal Democrat politicians, godless lowlifes that they are, for craftily blaming others for what they have unleashed upon our society. And the same also to all those who support them, and to others who remain silent and never speak out against this liberal evil. Evan Rubins Every year, there are nearly 12,000 firearm homicides in our country. That\u2019s more people than live in Catawba, Claremont, and Conover, combined. According to a study published in The American Journal of Medicine, compared with 22 other high-income nations, the U.S. gun-related murder rate is 25 times higher. Why? It comes down to regulations, enforcement, education, and expectations \u2013 in short, the culture. One pundit, Bill O\u2019Reilly, blogged that gun violence is \u201cthe price of freedom.\u201d I disagree. My vote is with the majority of Americans who support firearm control. I don\u2019t mean outlawing them, but enacting sensible policies on background checks, silencers, and assault weapons, to name a few. What will it take? Thoughtful lawmakers who will consider and support reasoned legislation. Let\u2019s look at our representatives. At the federal level, we have Sen. Richard Burr, who voted against a ban on assault weapons, and Sen. Thom Tillis, who voted against prohibiting the transfer of firearms to suspected terrorists. Last year, both senators voted against universal background checks for firearms purchases. Our congressman, Patrick McHenry, says on his website that he is \u201ccurrently a co-sponsor of legislation that will protect Second Amendment rights, including the SAFE Act and National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act, allowing for concealed carry reciprocity among states.\u201d He earned an A rating from the National Rifle Association, while State Sen. Andy Wells has received an NRA 93 percent rating. State Rep. Jay Adams sponsored the \u201cConstitutional Carry Act,\u201d which would allow any U.S. citizen 18 years or older to be able to carry a concealed handgun, unless otherwise disallowed by state or federal law. What is the sense in that? Responsible gun owners tell me the N.C. permitting process is reasonable and sound. Why let someone, like me, carry a weapon without checking whether I understand the weapon and safety? Remember the lesson relearned from Watergate? Follow the money. In 2016, the NRA gave Donald Trump, Burr, and five other Senate candidates $50.2 million (Burr got $6.2 million, the biggest chunk after Trump). Imagine how much education, and more, you could fund for $50.2 million? You could even train people in firearm safety. At this point, after 477 days with 521 mass shootings, I\u2019m with Rosanne Cash, who says, \u201cThe NRA funds domestic terrorism.\u201d Lynn Dorfman","label":1}
{"text":"The Truth About Russiagate: What the Media Doesn\u2019t Want You to Know: As the U.S. government doles out tens of millions of dollars to \u201ccombat Russian propaganda,\u201d one result is a slew of new \u201cstudies\u201d by \u201cscholars\u201d and \u201cresearchers\u201d auditioning for the loot, reports Robert Parry. ( CN) \u2014 The \u201cField of Dreams\u201d slogan for America\u2019s NGOs should be: \u201cIf you pay for it, we will come.\u201d And right now, tens of millions of dollars are flowing to non-governmental organizations if they will buttress the thesis of Russian \u201cmeddling\u201d in the U.S. democratic process no matter how sloppy the \u201cresearch\u201d or how absurd the \u201cfindings.\u201d And, if you think the pillars of the U.S. mainstream media \u2013 The Washington Post, The New York Times, CNN and others \u2013 will apply some quality controls, you haven\u2019t been paying attention for the past year or so. The MSM is just as unethical as the NGOs are. So, we are now in a phase of Russiagate in which NGO \u201cscholars\u201d produce deeply biased reports and their nonsense is treated as front-page news and items for serious discussion across the MSM. Yet, there\u2019s even an implicit confession about how pathetic some of this \u201cscholarship\u201d is in the hazy phrasing that gets applied to the \u201cfindings,\u201d although the weasel words will slip past most unsuspecting Americans and will be dropped for more definitive language when the narrative is summarized in the next day\u2019s newspaper or in a cable-news \u201ccrawl.\u201d For example, a Times front-page story on Thursday reported that \u201ca network of Twitter accounts suspected of links to Russia seized on both sides of the [NFL players kneeling during the National Anthem] issue with hashtags, such as #boycottnfl, #standforouranthem and #takeaknee.\u201d The story, which fits neatly into the current U.S. propaganda meme that the Russian government somehow is undermining American democracy by stirring up dissent inside the U.S., quickly spread to other news outlets and became the latest \u201cproof\u201d of a Russian \u201cwar\u201d against America. However, before we empty the nuclear silos and exterminate life on the planet, we might take a second to look at the Times phrasing: \u201ca network of Twitter accounts suspected of links to Russia.\u201d The vague wording doesn\u2019t even say the Russian government was involved but rather presents an unsupported claim that some Twitter accounts are \u201csuspected\u201d of being part of some \u201cnetwork\u201d and that this \u201cnetwork\u201d may have some ill-defined connection \u2013 or \u201clinks\u201d \u2013 to \u201cRussia,\u201d a country of 144 million people. \u2018Six Degrees from Kevin Bacon\u2019 It\u2019s like the old game of \u201csix degrees of separation\u201d from Kevin Bacon. Yes, perhaps we are all \u201clinked\u201d to Kevin Bacon somehow but that doesn\u2019t prove that we know Kevin Bacon or are part of a Kevin Bacon \u201cnetwork\u201d that is executing a grand conspiracy to sow discontent by taking opposite sides of issues and then tweeting. Yet that is the underlying absurdity of the Times article by Daisuke Wakabayashi and Scott Shane. Still, as silly as the article may be that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not dangerous. The Times\u2019 high-profile treatment of these gauzy allegations represents a grave danger to the world by fueling a growing hysteria inside the United States about being \u201cat war\u201d with nuclear-armed Russia. At some point, someone might begin to take this alarmist rhetoric seriously. Yes, I understand that lots of people hate President Trump and see Russiagate as the golden ticket to his impeachment. But that doesn\u2019t justify making serious allegations with next to no proof, especially when the outcome could be thermonuclear war. However, with all those millions of dollars sloshing around the NGO world and Western academia \u2013 all looking for some \u201cstudy\u201d to fund that makes Russia look bad \u2013 you are sure to get plenty of takers. And, we should now expect that new \u201cfindings\u201d like these will fill in for the so-far evidence-free suspicions about Russia and Trump colluding to steal the presidency from Hillary Clinton. If you read more deeply into the Times story, you get a taste of where Russiagate is headed next and a clue as to who is behind it: \u201cSince last month, researchers at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, a public policy research group in Washington, have been publicly tracking 600 Twitter accounts \u2014 human users and suspected bots alike \u2014 they have linked to Russian influence operations. Those were the accounts pushing the opposing messages on the N.F.L. and the national anthem. \u201cOf 80 news stories promoted last week by those accounts, more than 25 percent \u2018had a primary theme of anti-Americanism,\u2019 the researchers found. About 15 percent were critical of Hillary Clinton, falsely accusing her of funding left-wing antifa \u2014 short for anti-fascist \u2014 protesters, tying her to the lethal terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 and discussing her daughter Chelsea\u2019s use of Twitter. Eleven percent focused on wiretapping in the federal investigation into Paul Manafort, President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, with most of them treated the news as a vindication for President Trump\u2019s earlier wiretapping claims.\u201d The Neocons, Again! So, let\u2019s stop and unpack this Times\u2019 reporting. First, this Alliance for Securing Democracy is not some neutral truth-seeking organization but a neoconservative-dominated outfit that includes on its advisory board such neocon luminaries as Mike Chertoff, Bill Kristol and former Freedom House president David Kramer along with other anti-Russia hardliners such as former deputy CIA director Michael Morell and former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers. How many of these guys, do you think, were assuring us that Iraq was hiding WMDs back in 2003? This group clearly has an ax to grind, a record of deception, and plenty of patrons in the Military-Industrial Complex who stand to make billions of dollars from the New Cold War. The neocons also have been targeting Russia for regime change for years because they see Russian President Vladimir Putin as the chief obstacle to their goal of helping Israel achieve its desire for \u201cregime change\u201d in Syria and a chance to bomb-bomb-bomb Iran. Russiagate has served the neocons well as a very convenient way to pull Democrats, liberals and even progressives into the neocon agenda because Russiagate is sold as a powerful weapon for the anti-Trump Resistance. The Times article also might have mentioned that Twitter has 974 million accounts. So, this alarm over 600 accounts is a bit disproportionate for a front-page story in the Times, don\u2019t you think? And, there\u2019s the definitional problem of what constitutes \u201canti-Americanism\u201d in a news article. And what does it mean to be \u201clinked to Russian influence operations\u201d? Does that include Americans who may not march in lockstep to the one-sided State Department narratives on the crises in Ukraine and Syria? Any deviation from Official Washington\u2019s groupthink makes you a \u201cMoscow stooge.\u201d And, is it a crime to be \u201ccritical\u201d of Hillary Clinton or to note that the U.S. mainstream media was dismissive of Trump\u2019s claims about being wiretapped only for us to find out later that the FBI apparently was wiretapping his campaign manager? However, such questions aren\u2019t going to be asked amid what has become a massive Russiagate groupthink, dominating not just Official Washington, but across much of America\u2019s political landscape and throughout the European Union. Why the Bias? Beyond the obvious political motivations for this bias, we also have had the introduction of vast sums of money pouring in from the U.S. government, NATO and European institutions to support the business of \u201ccombatting Russian propaganda.\u201d For example, last December, President Obama signed into law a $160 million funding mechanism entitled the \u201cCombating Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act.\u201d But that amounts to only a drop in the bucket considering already existing Western propaganda projects targeting Russia. So, a scramble is on to develop seemingly academic models to \u201cprove\u201d what Western authorities want proven: that Russia is at fault for pretty much every bad thing that happens in the world, particularly the alienation of many working-class people from the Washington-Brussels elites. The truth cannot be that establishment policies have led to massive income inequality and left the working class struggling to survive and thus are to blame for ugly political manifestations \u2013 from Trump to Brexit to the surprising support for Germany\u2019s far-right AfD party. No, it must be Russia! Russia! Russia! And there\u2019s a lot of money on the bed to prove that point. There\u2019s also the fact that the major Western news media is deeply invested in bashing Russia as well as in the related contempt for Trump and his followers. Those twin prejudices have annihilated all professional standards that would normally be applied to news judgments regarding these flawed \u201cstudies.\u201d On Thursday, The Washington Post ran its own banner-headlined story drawn from the same loose accusations made by that neocon-led Alliance for Securing Democracy, but instead the Post sourced the claims to Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma. The headline read: \u201cRussian trolls are stoking NFL controversy, senator says.\u201d The \u201cevidence\u201d cited by Lankford\u2019s office was one \u201cTwitter account calling itself Boston Antifa that gives its geolocation as Vladivostok, Russia,\u201d the Post reported. By Thursday, Twitter had suspended the Boston Antifa account, so I couldn\u2019t send it a question, but earlier this month, Dan Glaun, a reporter for Masslive.com, reported that the people behind Boston Antifa were \u201ca pair of anti-leftist pranksters from Oregon who started Boston Antifa as a parody of actual anti-fascist groups.\u201d In an email to me on Thursday, Glaun cited an interview that the Boston Antifa pranksters had done with right-wing radio talk show host Gavin McInnes last April. And, by the way, there are apps that let you manipulate your geolocation data on Twitter. Or, you can choose to believe that the highly professional Russian intelligence agencies didn\u2019t notice that they were telegraphing their location as Vladivostok. Mindless Russia Bashing Another example of this mindless Russia bashing appeared just below the Post\u2019s story on Lankford\u2019s remarks. The Post sidebar cited a \u201cstudy\u201d from researchers at Oxford University\u2019s Project on Computational Propaganda asserting that \u201cjunk news\u201d on Twitter \u201cflowed more heavily in a dozen [U.S.] battleground states than in the nation overall in the days immediately before and after the 2016 presidential election, suggesting that a coordinated effort targeted the most pivotal voters.\u201d Cue the spooky Boris and Natasha music! Of course, any Americans living in \u201cbattleground states\u201d could tell you that they are inundated with all kinds of election-related \u201cjunk,\u201d including negative TV advertising, nasty radio messages, alarmist emails and annoying robo-calls at dinner time. That\u2019s why they\u2019re called \u201cbattleground states,\u201d Sherlock. But what\u2019s particularly offensive about this \u201cstudy\u201d is that it implies that the powers-that-be must do more to eliminate what these \u201cexperts\u201d deem \u201cpropaganda\u201d and \u201cjunk news.\u201d If you read deeper into the story, you discover that the researchers applied a very subjective definition of what constitutes \u201cjunk news,\u201d i.e., information that the researchers don\u2019t like even if it is truthful and newsworthy. The Post article by Craig Timberg, who apparently is using Russiagate to work himself off the business pages and onto the national staff, states that \u201cThe researchers defined junk news as \u2018propaganda and ideologically extreme, hyperpartisan, or conspiratorial political news and information.\u2019 \u201cThe researchers also categorized reports from Russia and ones from WikiLeaks \u2013 which published embarrassing posts about Democrat Hillary Clinton based on a hack of her campaign chairman\u2019s emails \u2013 as \u2018polarizing political content\u2019 for the purpose of the analysis.\u201d So, this \u201cstudy\u201d lumped together \u201cjunk news\u201d with accurate and newsworthy information, i.e., WikiLeaks\u2019 disclosure of genuine emails that contained such valid news as the contents of Clinton\u2019s speeches to Wall Street banks (which she was trying to hide from voters) as well as evidence of the unethical tactics used by the Democratic National Committee to sabotage Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign. Also dumped into the researchers\u2019 bin of vile \u201cdisinformation\u201d were \u201creports from Russia,\u201d as if everything that comes out of Russia is, ipso facto, \u201cjunk news.\u201d And, what, pray tell, is \u201cconspiratorial political news\u201d? I would argue that the past year of evidence-lite allegations about \u201cRussian meddling\u201d in the U.S. election accompanied by unsupported suspicions about \u201ccollusion\u201d with the Trump campaign would constitute \u201cconspiratorial political news.\u201d Indeed, I would say that this Oxford \u201cresearch\u201d constitutes \u201cconspiratorial political news\u201d and that Timberg\u2019s article qualifies as \u201cjunk news.\u201d  Predictable Outcome Given the built-in ideological bias of this \u201cresearch,\u201d it probably won\u2019t surprise you that the report\u2019s author, Philip N. Howard, concludes that \u201cjunk news originates from three main sources that the Oxford group has been tracking: Russian operatives, Trump supporters and activists part of the alt-right,\u201d according to the Post. I suppose that since part of the \u201cmethodology\u201d was to define \u201creports from Russia\u201d as \u201cjunk news,\u201d the appearance of \u201cRussian operatives\u201d shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise, but the whole process reeks of political bias.

{"text":"Donald Trump: From Fake Anti-Interventionist to History\u2019s Most Hawkish President: ( ANTIMEDIA Op-ed) \u2014 One of the reasons Donald Trump appealed to many American voters during the 2016 election is that much of what he promised on the campaign trail directly contradicted Hillary Clinton\u2019s record, particularly in terms of foreign policy. For example, before the election, he explicitly stated that he believed the world would have been better off had the U.S. not toppled Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Muammar Gaddafi in Libya (he previously did advocate for removing Gaddafi and Husseinbut apparently hoped his support-base wouldn\u2019t notice). As aptly explained by Anti-Media\u2019s JP Sottile: \u201cTrump never had a \u2018policy\u2019 of anti-interventionism. He was simply a troll who tweeted outoppositional statements attacking Obama\u2019s foreign policy. If Obama was doing it \u2026 he was against it. He knew that no matter what, it was red meat for his future base. Then he grandstanded on Iraq to torpedo Jeb Bush. And he attacked Hillary\u2019s militarism \u2026 because it was expedient. Go back and listen to him speaking at those rallies. The real Donald Trump is the guy who wants to \u2018bomb the shit\u2019 out of \u2019em and take their oil and kill their families. The real Trump is the guy who proclaimed in his bizarre inauguration speech that \u2018Radical Islamic Terrorism\u2019 was something he wanted to \u2018eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.\u2019\u201d The sad truth is that after barely seven months in office, Donald Trump is \u201cthe most hawkish president in modern history,\u201d as the Council on Foreign Relation\u2019s Micah Zenko put it. By the end of July, Trump had already dropped almost as many bombs in his first six months in office as Barack Obama did in the whole of 2016. As of July 31, Trump had dropped 20,650 bombs in 2017 compared to Obama\u2019s 26,171 for all of last year. One should also note that the rate of bombs dropped by Obama in 2016 was higher than in 2015, and Trump is set on a path to potentially double that murderous rate. This trend in violence can be explained through Trump\u2019s decision to empower his military generals to call in airstrikes directly from the battlefield without any oversight, a move that has culminated in widespread civilian suffering. Since July, the bombs have still been dropped at unprecedented rates throughout the Middle East. The end result, as the Intercept reports, is that entire families are being wiped out by American-taxpayer funded missiles. All that being said, Trump\u2019s willingness to overuse the American military extends far beyond that of deadly air strikes. As Zenko explains: \u201cTrump has also escalated U.S. military involvement in non-battlefield settings \u2014 namely Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan. In the last 193 days of the Obama presidency, there were 21 lethal counterterrorism operations across these three countries. Trump has quintupled that number, conducting at least 92 such operations in Yemen, seven in Somalia, and four in Pakistan.\u201d [emphasis added] Essentially, Obama inherited two hot wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and significantly expanded operations in at least five other countries (six, if you include the Philippines). Similarly, Trump has inherited all of these wars from Obama, has radically amplified them with no real end in sight, and is willing to further expand the scope of hot wars to Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela. His administration is also considering wider involvement in the Philippines. Those thinking \u2018So what? Trump\u2019s making America great again!\u2019 need to consider how long this strategy can be implemented and what the consequences are. The U.N. is already issuing stark warnings about U.S. activity in Syria, even directly suggesting that the U.S. is breaching international legal standards. Those standards are there for a reason; the U.S. considers breaches of international humanitarian law to be very serious crimes when committed by other regimes. Although the U.S. can continue to escape criminal liability because of its superpower status, it is still unclear how these wars will come to an end given they amount to a relentlessly violent overall strategy in a host of countries that pose no threat to the United States. Weak and unstable states like Somalia and Iraq cannot directly threaten the U.S. mainland, but if the U.S. continues to exacerbate a strategy that is documented to create countless supplies of terrorists in the process, then eventually, the U.S. will be looking at some very serious retaliation. Not only will the wars likely not come to an end anytime soon, the wars will be \u2013 in more ways than one \u2013 only just getting started. Over a decade and a half after 9\/11, Americans should question a foreign policy that continues to punish civilian populations in countries that played no active role in those terror attacks. The countries that did play an active role in attacking American civilians, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are some of America\u2019s closest allies. As Donald Trump ramps up the never-ending quagmire that is Afghanistan and sword-dances his way through the Middle East while making billion-dollar arms deals with the very country he once accused of committing 9\/11, the American people need to understand that they have been hoodwinked by one of the best con men on the planet. Trump is not an anti-interventionist \u2014 and he never was. He is also not going to save you from \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d considering he is continuing and perpetuating the very policies that create this line of terrorism in the first place. Trump is not making America \u201cgreat again,\u201d nor is he any different than Bush, Clinton, and Obama. In more ways than one, Trump is arguably worse \u2014 and certainly far more hawkish.  Since you\u2019re here\u2026 \u2026We have a small favor to ask. Fewer and fewer people are seeing Anti-Media articles as social media sites crack down on us, and advertising revenues across the board are quickly declining.

{"text":"Ron Paul: What Did Washington Achieve in its Six Year War on Syria?: ( RPI) \u2014 Now that the defeat of ISIS in Syria appears imminent, with the Syrian army clearing out some of the last ISIS strongholds in the east, Washington\u2019s interventionists are searching for new excuses to maintain the illegal US military presence in the country. Their original rationale for intervention has long been exposed as another lie. Remember that President Obama initially involved the US military in Iraq and Syria to \u201cprevent genocide\u201d of the Yazidis and promised the operation would not drift into US \u201cboots on the ground.\u201d That was three years ago and the US military became steadily more involved while Congress continued to dodge its Constitutional obligations. The US even built military bases in Syria despite having no permission to do so! Imagine if Syria started building military bases here in the US against our wishes. After six years of war the Syrian government has nearly defeated ISIS and al-Qaeda and the US-backed \u201cmoderates\u201d turned out to be either Islamist extremists or Kurdish soldiers for hire. According to a recent report, the US has shipped two billion dollars worth of weapons to fighters in Syria via eastern Europe. Much of these weapons ended up in the hands of ISIS directly, or indirectly through \u201cmoderates\u201d taking their weapons with them while joining ISIS or al-Qaeda. \u201cAssad must go,\u201d proclaimed President Obama back in 2011, as he claimed that the Syrian leader was committing genocide against his own people and that regime change was the only way to save Syrians. Then earlier this year, when eastern Aleppo was about to be liberated by the Syrian government, the neocons warned that Assad would move in and kill all the inhabitants. They warned that the population of eastern Aleppo would flee from the Syrian army. But something very different happened. According to the UN\u2019s International Organization for Migration, 600,000 refugees returned to Syria by August. Half of the returnees went back to Aleppo, where we were told Assad was waiting to kill them. What happened? The neocons and \u201chumanitarian interventionists\u201d lied. Just as they lied about Libya, Iraq, and so on. While it was mostly ignored by the mainstream media, just this week a Christian was elected speaker of the Syrian parliament. The new speaker is a 58-year-old Orthodox Christian law graduate and member of President Assad\u2019s Baath party. How many Christians does our \u201cally\u201d Saudi Arabia have in its parliament? Oh I forgot, Saudi Arabia has no elected parliament. Why does it seem that US policy in the Middle East always hurts Christians the most? In Iraq, Christians suffered disproportionately from the 2003 US invasion. In fact there are hardly any Christians left. Why aren\u2019t more US Christian groups demanding that the US get out of the Middle East? The US is not about to leave on its own. With ISIS all but defeated in Syria, many in Washington are calling for the US military to continue its illegal occupation of parts of the country to protect against Iranian influence! Of course before the US military actions in Iraq and Syria there was far less Iranian influence in the region! So US foreign interventionism is producing new problems that can only be solved by more US interventionism? The military industrial complex could not have dreamed of a better scheme to rob the American people while enriching themselves! What have we achieved in Syria? Nothing good.

{"text":"40 Teens Attack, San Fran Transit Refuses To Give Surveillance \u2013 Because Of Racism Against Black Criminals: This is just loony tunes. In San Francisco (I\u2019m so shocked\u2026), Bay Area Rapid Transit or BART, has decided that they won\u2019t release surveillance video basically because it\u2019s racist and shows minorities in a bad light. Right. So, the very first thing we know here, is the majority of crimes committed on BART are not by white, middle class, Tea Party types. Gotcha. What I don\u2019t get is if you are trying to catch criminals who are robbing these trains, why in the hell wouldn\u2019t you release the surveillance videos? There have been at least three robberies over the last three months on BART. And more before that. Gangs of young people storm the trains, rob the passengers and then take off. What does that have to do with the color of their skin? It has to do with being a CRIMINAL. This is liberal group-think. There\u2019s no logic, just political correctness and the fear of offending someone. It\u2019s okay if someone is robbed, beaten up or even killed\u2026 just don\u2019t offend the poor criminals, you racist pig. Both the public and the police are demanding the videos be released. It\u2019s damned hard for the police to do their jobs and track down these thugs if they don\u2019t know what they even look like. BART is aiding and abetting those that rob them. And yet they demand the police DO SOMETHING. SMH.  From TheBlaze:  Authorities with San Francisco\u2019s Bay Area Rapid Transit service are refusing to release surveillance videos of several crimes because doing so \u201cwould create a high level of racially insensitive commentary toward the district.\u201d Over the last three months, there have been at least three robberies on BART trains, but footage of those crimes won\u2019t see the light of day, if officials with the transportation service get their way, KPIX-TV reported. 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now Debora Allen, a member of the BART board of directors, said she was told that releasing the video surveillance \u201cwould create a racial bias in the riders against minorities on the trains.\u201d Allen, unsatisfied with what she had been told, emailed BART assistant general manager Kerry Hamill about the issue, writing: \u201cI don\u2019t understand what role the color of one\u2019s skin plays in this issue [of whether to divulge information]. Can you explain?\u201d Hamill replied: \u201cIf we were to regularly feed the news media video of crimes on our system that involve minority suspects, particularly when they are minors, we would certainly face questions as to why we were sensationalizing relatively minor crimes and perpetuating false stereotypes in the process.\u201d  BART assistant general manager Kerry Hamill even went so far as to insinuate the only thing people are interested in are TV ratings and sensationalism concerning these videos. \u201cThey know that video of these events will drive clicks to their websites and viewers to their programs because people are motivated by fear,\u201d Hamil said. You know\u2026 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s it dumbass. I think people are fearful of riding BART now, especially at night, because these thugs are violent and they don\u2019t want to be robbed. So, let me get this straight\u2026 BART doesn\u2019t value their passengers as much as they do the racial sentiments of criminals. Interesting. According to BART spokesman Taylor Huckaby, state law protecting \u201cjuvenile police records\u201d bars them from releasing the surveillance footage. He added that blurring out the faces of the minors would only lead people to pointlessly watch the videos. First off, if they aren\u2019t caught, they don\u2019t have a police record. Second, this isn\u2019t about voyeurism of surveillance videos\u2026 it\u2019s about identifying and catching criminals who are hurting and robbing others. You people are just nuts and you are idiots on top of it. People will start avoiding BART and I don\u2019t blame them. They care less about their passengers than the criminals that attack them. Sick AND twisted. ","label":1}
{"text":"BUSTED? NY Democrat To Linda Sarsour: Where\u2019s the $100k You Raised for Jewish Cemetery?: Islamic activist and Sharia law apologist Linda Sarsour has come under a lot of fire lately. She recently faced withering criticism after she called for \u201cJihad\u201d against the Trump administration and has responded to her critics time and time again by accusing them of \u201cIslamophobia.\u201d But now, she\u2019s getting criticized by Democrats, too.  Dov Hikind is a Brooklyn Democrat and a New York state assemblyman, and he slammed Sarsour for not giving money she promised to a Jewish cemetery that is in desperate need of repairs. Sarsour raised $100,000 for Golden Hill Cemetery in Lakewood, CO., but the cemetery director has said that they have not received a check, despite repeated calls. Sarsour joined with Tarek El-Messidi, the founder of non-profit Islamic education organization Celebrate Mercy, in February and March to raise money from the Muslim community to go towards anti-semitic attacks and vandalism after Donald Trump\u2019s election \u2014 a noble goal, indeed. And the Muslim community responded generously. Sarsour\u2019s original goal was a mere $20,000, but they quickly soared past that goal. And some money was given. $50,000 was given to repair two Jewish cemeteries and a synagogue that had been vandalized. But the money promised to Golden Hill Cemetery has not materialized. And Hikind has called her out for it. \u201cSarsour is a fraud,\u201d Hikind said. \u201cShe talks out of both sides of her mouth. One minute she\u2019s claiming to be a disciple of the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the next she\u2019s standing with a terrorist on stage at an event [Rasmea Odeh], and singing praises of that terrorist to an audience. I won\u2019t be the least bit surprised to hear that her little Jewish cemetery publicity stunt wasn\u2019t quite what she made it out to be.\u201d \u201cI understood that Sarsour\u2019s fundraiser was just a publicity stunt meant to mask her efforts to hurt the State of Israel while glorifying her terrorist pals in various Tweets and speeches,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut I also hoped that the money she raised would at least help these cemeteries. After all, Sarsour has no loss of affection for dead Jews. But this new report raises questions about where the money went. Perhaps if this story gets out, the shame will cause Sarsour to direct the funds to the people it was promised to. Then again, shame implies an elevated sense of self-awareness, and someone who glorifies terrorists is rarely sullied by a scruple.\u201d Ouch. Sarsour wasted no time responding on Twitter. She also went on a rambling Facebook rant, blaming the issue on \u201cZionists.\u201d But it sounds like she\u2019s going to need a much better excuse than that if she doesn\u2019t pay up soon.","label":1}
{"text":"Gatekeeper of DC Society Comes Out As Occultist, Admits Using Hex To Kill People: I have never been part of high society and I have been thankful for that small blessing my entire life. I view all people as the same until they prove otherwise. That proof for a woman named Sally Quinn just surfaced and it is dark and evil. She is the widow of Ben Bradlee, the Washington Post\u2019s powerful executive editor from 1968 to 1991, who then served as the paper\u2019s vice president until his death in 2014. This power couple ruled the social scene in Washington, DC for nearly 50 years. They were hailed as the New Camelot. In fact, Bradlee had his career take off because of his friendship with John F. Kennedy. They decided who was \u2018in\u2019 and who was \u2018out\u2019, as if they were royalty and I guess in a way they were. They are the epitome of the elite\u2026 they are the very face of the Ruling Class in America. These are the people who have weaponized the media against middle America, against conservatives and Christians, against you and me.  It turns out that Sally Quinn is an occultist. I would never have believed it, but it is evidently so. According to her own memoir, she is a witch and has murdered three innocent people by way of a hex. One was a young woman who committed suicide after flirting with Quinn\u2019s boyfriend at the time. Another was a magazine editor who published an unflattering profile of Quinn\u2026 he died of cancer decades later. Last but not least, her last victim was a psychic who died of a cerebral hemorrhage before the end of the year after telling Quinn something she did not want to hear. I have no idea what that was. Now, I\u2019m not sure I buy the whole \u2018hex\u2019 thing. But I do know the power of suggestion is very powerful. So is hatred and persecuting others you don\u2019t like when you wield the kind of power Quinn does. Who knows? Either she\u2019s delusional, insane and needs to be locked up, or she\u2019s deeply evil and needs to be put down. Maybe both. The media is spinning it as her journey from atheism to magic in her quest for spirituality. I call it all kinds of wrong.  Quinn practiced the occult in the darkest ways possible into adulthood. She finally stopped, but not because she felt guilt or remorse: \u201cShe outs herself as a believer in the occult and as an erstwhile practitioner of voodoo \u2026 [and t]he book is awash in tales of Quinn\u2019s occult prowess\u2014she wants people to take this seriously, or at least to believe she takes this seriously. At the very least, she scared herself so badly when her third curse hit its mark\u2014prompting a panic that her previous hexes had been karmically responsible for her son\u2019s illness\u2014that she vowed never to dabble in the dark arts again.\u201d Gee, didn\u2019t Hillary Clinton just discuss voodoo dolls and getting back at Comey, Trump and Congress for coming after her on her email scandal? What are the odds? Quinn also plotted to break up Bradlee\u2019s marriage (which she did) and used the threat of adultery to bend Bradlee to her will. Just as disturbing as these actions is the way the Washington Post outs them. in the Outlook section under the matter-of-fact headline, \u201cSally Quinn\u2019s hexes, marital ultimatums and visceral love of her son,\u201d they casually tell of Quinn\u2019s occult endeavors. The piece was written by Connie Schultz and she had an odd criticism of Quinn: \u201cHad Sally Quinn stayed true to the promise of her book\u2019s whimsical title, \u201cFinding Magic: A Spiritual Memoir,\u201d she might have led readers on a journey of self-exploration as she shared her stories of hope and the many faces of faith in the aftermath of despair.\u201d This comes out and no one bats an eye over it. Call me crazy, but a powerful socialite who controls one of the biggest media outlets in the US coming out as an occultist is a bombshell. It\u2019s discussed as casually as plastic surgery or sex. This same Ruling Class jokes about hexing President Trump as well. There has been all sorts of rumors in the media about those in DC, especially on the left, who are involved in witchcraft and occultism. Most of them I discount. But as more and more is admitted like this about Quinn, you start to wonder. With all the character assassination, the stoking of racial conflict, the hate campaigns, the advocating of violence, the unending cultural bigotry and the communist agendas, I find myself wondering if all that goes on among the elite goes well beyond corruption and into much darker realms. In my opinion, there is no doubt these people are evil. But coming out of the demonic closet is something else. SMH.","label":0}
{"text":"EXCLUSIVE! Lynch Kicked Comey Out Of Room After He Exposed The Truth!: Not that I trust Comey as far as I can throw him, but this is interesting.

He purportedly presented a highly sensitive piece of evidence to Lynch, who looked at the document and then looked back up at Comey with a death stare and basically told him to get out.

It\u2019s beyond obvious to anyone paying attention that Lynch suppressed evidence against Clinton. She was and is corrupt. Comey was dismissed from Lynch\u2019s presence because she knew what he had shown her was the truth. In a Twitter post Tuesday, President Donald Trump weighed in on the revelation, writing, \u201cA.G.

Everyone acted as though it was new during the hearing\u2026 it wasn\u2019t. But we all knew this to be the case. The challenge is that no one did anything about it.

First off, I thought this was a dude\u2026 it\u2019s getting so hard to tell anymore. I hate boycotts, but I would say if you are going to boycott someone, start with Patagonia. They sell outdoor clothing if you can believe it. Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario had a meltdown over Trump rolling back Obama\u2019s fascist land grabs for national monuments. Now she\u2019s dedicating her whole company to revolting against the President of the United States. I call that subversive. She no doubt sees herself as a radical, revolutionary freedom fighter.

She intends to sue President Trump over it. The Trump administration is preparing to revisit Obama\u2019s order to create the Bears Ears National Monument. In April, Trump issued an executive order requiring the Department of the Interior to review Obama\u2019s actions on national monuments. Ordering Interior Secretary Ray Zinke to review Obama\u2019s policies in April, President Trump called Obama\u2019s move an \u201cegregious abuse of federal power.\u201d And it was.

{"text":"BREAKING: Postal Service Broke Federal Law In Support Of Democrats For Hillary Clinton During 2016 Election [VIDEO]: Just wow. The US Postal Service has been caught in violation of the Hatch Act. They broke federal law when their union employees actively campaigned for Hillary Clinton and other Democratic candidates \u2013 they allowed them to take unpaid \u201cunion official\u201d leave. The Hatch Act prohibits certain governmental employees from getting involved in political campaigns. They say any violation of law was unintended. That\u2019s not good enough. They are a federal agency and are required to know the law. Furthermore, I don\u2019t believe they didn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t see how they couldn\u2019t have known. The Office of Special Counsel is now saying that nearly 100 employees of the postal service violated the law when they took a leave from work to participate in the AFL-CIO\u2019s \u201cLabor 2016 program.\u201d This shows a blatant bias towards the Democratic Party and it is the doing of the union. The workers took weeks off from their jobs to work on campaigns and they were reimbursed by the National Association of Letter Carriers for their campaign work. They were campaigning for pro-worker, pro-union candidates. In other words, communists.  From TheBlaze:  The United States Postal Service broke a federal law by allowing employees to take unpaid \u201cunion official\u201d leave so they could campaign for Hillary Clinton and other Democratic candidates during last year\u2019s election. 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now According to a report from FoxNews.com, the Office of Special Counsel recently determined that the USPS violated the Hatch Act by allowing nearly 100 employees to take leave from work in order to participate in the AFL-CIO\u2019s \u201cLabor 2016 program.\u201d The OSC report says the USPS showed \u201cbias\u201d by allowing workers to take leave to help conduct the union campaign activities. The report says 97 postal workers were granted \u201cunion leave.\u201d Those workers took weeks off from their jobs at the postal service and were reimbursed by the National Association of Letter Carriers for their campaign work. \u201cThe Labor 2016 program sought to \u2018elect Hillary Clinton and pro-worker candidates across the country,\u2019\u201d according to the OSC report.  Postal workers from North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, Wisconsin and Nevada took part in this. The government found out about the blatant violation of the Hatch Act when a whistleblower from Wisconsin came forward. This person contacted their congressional representatives to inform them that they thought the election was impeding the work of the US Postal Service. This prompted an investigation. The Hatch Act is a federal law that bars federal employees from participating in partisan activities while on the job. The purpose of the law is to ensure that federal programs are administered in a non-partisan fashion. The National Association of Letter Carriers is denying any wrong doing and says they did not violate the Hatch Act, when they obviously and knowingly did. The Senate Homeland Security  ; Governmental Affairs Committee is holding a hearing about the violations today. USPS Postmaster General Megan Brennan is scheduled to testify. Man, I hope they nail them on this. They probably won\u2019t, but I sure hope they do.","label":1}

Now she is saying that President Trump comforted \u201cmillions of white people\u201d with his campaign during an interview airing Sunday on CBS. That\u2019s right\u2026 she\u2019s calling everyone who is white a racist. I\u2019m sure her intent was to call Trump one, but once again\u2026 open mouth, insert hoof. \u201cHe was quite successful in referencing the nostalgia that would give hope, comfort, settle grievances, for millions of people who were upset about gains that were made by others,\u201d Clinton leveled at Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is millions of white people,\u201d host Jane Pauley stated. \u201cMillions of white people,\u201d Clinton confirmed. \u201cYeah, millions of white people.\u201d Wow\u2026 way to alienate most of America in one fell swoop. That\u2019s worse than the slur of \u2018baskets of deplorables\u2019 and I thought that was the gaff to end all gaffs. She did address that piece of stupidity as well and made it even worse. Instead of apologizing for insulting so many people, she blamed\u2026 you guessed it\u2026 Trump. She said she regretted handing Trump a political gift, but also for saying a \u201clarge number of people\u201d didn\u2019t care about Trump\u2019s behavior. She still doesn\u2019t get it. She never will.  The interview was pre-taped yesterday. Pauley asked Clinton about her so-called \u2018surprising\u2019 defeat. No one is surprised by it except Clinton and the left, But I digress. She wanted to know what derailed Clinton\u2019s campaign that was \u201csupposed to make history\u201d by electing her the first female president of the United States. In a word, Hillary. But that\u2019s not how the Hildabeast sees it of course. She blamed it on stereotypes, sexism and misogyny.

Buy Now In the interview, Clinton said she knew she was going to have to \u201chave to work extra hard to make women and men feel comfortable with the idea of a woman president.\u201d Instead, she should have worked extra hard to be an actual likable candidate. She should have not kept on committing crimes and lying about them. She should have given a damn about Americans in general. But she did none of that. Then Donald Trump happened to her and she royally deserved it. While Hillary is promoting her book and blaming anyone and anything but herself for her loss of the presidency, the rest of America is either bored by her, amused at her stupidity or angry that no one seems interested in prosecuting this shrew. This part of the interview I found particularly ironic\u2026 Clinton did give one direct answer to Pauley\u2019s question about things she did that cost her the election. \u201cOh, I think the most important of the mistakes I made was using personal email,\u201d she said, referring to her use of a private server for official State Department business. Bwa ha ha ha ha! Ya think? She should have gone to prison for that alone, but alas, DC is covering for her yet again. In the closing of the interview, Hillary shows yet again that she is beyond clueless and doesn\u2019t understand Americans at all. \u201cI believed that it was my responsibility to try to offer answers to it, not to fan it,\u201d she said of the public\u2019s anger over the financial crisis. \u201cI think, Jane, that it was a mistake because a lot of people didn\u2019t wanna hear my plans. They wanted me to share their anger. And I should\u2019ve done a better job of demonstrating I get it.\u201d So, she just wasn\u2019t angry enough.

{"text":"5 Yr-Old Christian Girl Forced Into Muslim Foster Care: Why would you do this? Unless of course you were forcing a whole population to submit to Islam. A 5 year-old little Christian girl is being forced to live in a Muslim foster care home. This is happening in London. The parents of the child are totally against this and I assume are trying to get her back. The child had her cross taken away and was told that Christmas and Easter are stupid. She was also told European women are alcoholics. This is child abuse. That child should be removed from their care immediately. She\u2019s been with them six months already and is being forced to learn Arabic. The child has sobbed and begged not to go back to this foster home. I don\u2019t blame her. Both of her female caretakers covered their faces with Islamic veils when they accompanied the child out of the house. This means they are Salafi-influenced Muslims, which is a puritanical form of Islam. The first foster caretaker, who she was with for four months, wore the niqab; the one she is living with currently wears a burqa. If a Muslim child were in the system, you can bet they would only place the child with Muslims. So again I ask\u2026 why was a Christian child placed in a Muslim home like this?  From Breitbart:  A white, Christian, five-year-old girl has been forced to live with Muslim foster carers who removed her cross, encouraged her to learn Arabic, and told her European women were alcoholics. The five-year-old girl was put into the foster care system by scandal-ridden Tower Hamlets borough council, and has spent six months in two Muslim households against the parents\u2019 wishes, reports The Times. In local authority reports seen by the newspaper, a social services worker describes the sobbing child begging to not be returned to the foster home, saying \u201cthey don\u2019t speak English\u201d. Another report, which describes the girl as \u201cvery distressed\u201d, reads that the girl was not allowed to eat a carbonara meal because it had bacon in it (forbidden in Islam), and recorded claims she had her necklace and Christian cross pendant removed by one carer, and was allegedly encouraged to learn Arabic. During a visit with her mother, the girl said she was told that \u201cChristmas and Easter are stupid\u201d and that \u201cEuropean women are stupid and alcoholic\u201d.  The child should be in familiar surroundings and comforted as she is already traumatized from being separated from her parents. This is cruel and shows either a hatred of Christianity, or a stunning ignorance of religion. The Tower Hamlets borough council is known for widespread election fraud and was once controlled by Islamist-linked former mayor Lutfur Rahman, who was banned from public office for five years in April 2015 after facing allegations of rigging elections, serious corruption and using \u201cundue spiritual influence\u201d over voters.

{"text":"Loretta Lynch, Clinton Campaign, Soros Officials \u2013 ALL Called Into Senate PROBE: What an interesting turn of events. The Senate Judiciary Committee has sent four investigatory letters out over the Comey affair. Among those receiving letters were Loretta Lynch; Leonard Bernardo, the Eurasia Director of leftist billionaire George Soros\u2019s infamous Open Societies Foundations; senior Clinton staffer Amanda Renteria and Open Society Foundations General Counsel Gail Scovell. All are now being swept up in the Senate probe. The probe wants all documents and information relating to Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal and Loretta Lynch\u2019s obstruction of that investigation. One of the primary issues here is Lynch telling then-Director Comey in September of 2015 to refer to the investigation of Secretary Clinton and her staff as a \u201cmatter.\u201d Then the Justice Department obtained a Russian document in March of 2016 showing a \u201cDemocratic operative\u201d expressing \u201cconfidence that Ms. Lynch would keep the Clinton investigation from going too far.\u201d That is clearly obstruction of justice and may well be Loretta Lynch\u2019s downfall.

This investigation has legs and is going to stick because there was actual intent and actions that went towards covering up corruption and crimes on Hillary Clinton\u2019s part. The Department of Justice is sinking their teeth into this one. George Soros was in this up to his neck facilitating criminal activities. It would be a dream come true if he was nailed over all this. Lynch\u2019s meeting on the tarmac with Bill Clinton could be her undoing. There is surely an NSA tape of that conversation since it was on a government plane.

Is that what he\u2019s getting at here? Another boycott of Starbucks has now ensued. I don\u2019t go there and never will. I don\u2019t feel like being overcharged by communists, thank you. Prejudice, bigotry and hatred don\u2019t know color. Any person who would treat another that way is a vile human being and is disgusting. We are all humans and no one is better than anyone else, just different. I don\u2019t see Schultz decrying hatred and violence against white people or cops, do you? He hasn\u2019t denounced the communists, Antifa or Black Lives Matter, but he\u2019s all about going after all the evil white people. How about we knock off the racism on both sides? Get a grip America.  From Young Conservatives:  Howard Schultz, former CEO of Starbucks, now a special projects director decided to go for the full-bore offensive tweet on Saturday.  \"I know we're better than this. The bigotry, hatred, and senseless violence against people who are not white cannot stand.\u201d \u2014Howard Schultz pic.twitter.com\/JWpOmIV0H0 \u2014 Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) August 16, 2017  So Howard, what are you trying to say? That there can be no bigotry, hatred and senseless violence against white people? Or that you\u2019re cool with it? People were outraged over Schultz\u2019s comments and called for more boycotts of Starbucks. [\u2026] Of course, he failed to mention the violent leftist attacks which have been going on for months. 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now Schultz is clearly delusional. In a speech he gave to Starbucks workers, he let everyone feel a rock he brought back from Auschwitz and compared the slaughter of millions to what is going on now in America. The company published an article about the speech and quoted a new worker about what he got from the Schultz speech. He said: \u201cThat rock represented the blood of millions who fell victim to something very similar to what we are facing now,\u201d he said quietly.  These people have a fascist fetish and don\u2019t realize that they are fascists themselves. Schultz insinuates that America is like the Holocaust in Nazi, Germany. Really? Actually, we didn\u2019t have racial problems rise up again until Barack Obama came into office. Now, it is the weapon of choice for the left to bring President Trump down because the whole Russian farce didn\u2019t pan out. What next? Aliens? Starbucks is an overpriced luxury that I don\u2019t find attractive. Once they started bringing politics in the mix, they became expendable in my world. Schultz should check his own personal white privilege before he starts lecturing Americans. I\u2019m sick of all of this and I\u2019m definitely fed up with the left pushing a race war for political purposes. Just say no to Starbucks.","label":1}
{"text":"[WATCH] DEMANDS That Whites Open Bank Accounts Solely to Pay Reparations For Their Ancestors Owning Slaves: The idea of reparations has been around for a long time. Some activists believe that white Americans should be forced to pay black Americans whose ancestors were slaves. It\u2019s not something that most people take seriously, but HBO host Bill Maher welcomed a guest who argues for exactly this on his show recently.  Maher recently landed in hot water for using the n-word on his show \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher\u201d and he\u2019s only just come back on the air. One of his first guests was Georgetown University professor Michael Eric Dyson, who unsurprisingly lectured Maher about his racist slip-up. \u201cThat\u2019s our word, and you can\u2019t have it back,\u201d Dyson told Maher, who agreed. \u201cI did a bad thing,\u201d Maher responded. \u201cFor black folks, that word, I don\u2019t care who you are, has caused pain. I\u2019m not here to do that.\u201d The real question, of course, is how Maher still has his job, but apparently celebrities can commit any manner of sins and have them excused, as long as they\u2019re liberals. Dyson seemed eager to give his forgiveness to Maher for something he did directly, but strangely, he\u2019s not so eager to forgive every other white American for things they had nothing to do with. Dyson wants all white Americans to be forced to open bank accounts which would be used as an \u201cindividual reparations account,\u201d with the money within given to black groups in an effort to make up for the history of slavery in America. Never mind the countless white Americans who fought \u2014 and died \u2014 to end slavery. \u201cLook, if it doesn\u2019t cost you anything, you\u2019re not really engaging in change; you\u2019re engaging in convenience,\u201d he argued. \u201cYou\u2019re engaged in the overflow. I\u2019m asking you to do stuff you wouldn\u2019t ordinarily do. I\u2019m asking you to think more seriously and strategically about why you possess what you possess. That is what I meant by an I.R.A.: an individual reparations account.\u201d So even though white Americans living today had nothing to do with slavery, they should be forced to pay reparations for it? Sure, buddy. Would you be willing to pay reparations to black Americans?","label":1}
{"text":"Fmr Black Panther Takes to Social Media Calling For ACTION After Vegas Shooting \u2018Our Culture Is Under Attack\u2019 [VIDEO]: Mason Weaver, a former Black Panther, did an awesome video on the shooting in Las Vegas. In it he points out that it doesn\u2019t matter whether it was a leftist, an Islamic extremist or a communist Antifa goon. The reason this happened is because our culture has changed and he\u2019s right. Somewhere down the road, it became acceptable to hurt others and to kill if you felt offended enough. Everything has been uber politicized and the anger is being stoked by both sides. The results are deadly as you can see in Las Vegas with 58 dead and over 500 wounded. We have forgotten what it means to be an American\u2026 to defend our culture and our way of life. To take pride in our country and our citizens, and yes, in our President. The killer knew he would become infamous for killing so many and probably hoped to hurt conservatives and the President by doing so. He wanted the infamy and he knew there was no way out for himself. That\u2019s why he committed suicide before SWAT could get to him on the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay. As Weaver points out, this is not how we behave as Americans. And he\u2019s also right when he says this guy didn\u2019t just \u2018snap\u2019. This was pre-planned and well-organized. It was premeditated mass murder. He brought over ten weapons and checked into the hotel three days before the killing spree even happened. He was waiting for the perfect moment and carried out his plan meticulously.  Weaver calls this a cultural glitch in who we are as a people. Again, that is exactly right. This is the radical fringe. Think of it as a circle where the violent radicals congregate. It\u2019s where fascists and communists meet\u2026 it\u2019s where terrorists play. Instead of pulling together as Americans, we have Balkanized America. We have divided our country into smaller, mutually hostile groups. Now we have 28 different genders, homosexuals, African Americans, Native Americans and the list goes on and on and on. This was all part of a communist plan to tear us apart as a culture, a nation and as a society and we fell for it. Just ask an ex-Black Panther and he\u2019ll tell you. There is no one who knows communism better than an ex-communist, or someone who knows terrorism better than an ex-terrorist. It\u2019s not in fashion to be American. People try to bully Americans and shame them for being patriotic and for loving their country. They label them as racist and violent, when for the overwhelming majority, nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, you almost exclusively find the violence on the left with the communists who created this mess in the first place. We\u2019ve allowed cowardly, wimpy, pansified leftists to take over our country and teach and control our children. Shame on all of us. Americans know we are the freest, greatest nation on earth. Yet, we allow those who would destroy us and our way of life to control the narrative. It\u2019s time to put all the division aside and declare that you are a proud American period. No race, no gender, no religion, no political affiliation\u2026 you are simply and greatly an American. Start acting like one.","label":0}
{"text":"Cast Your Eyes On This List of the First US Black President\u2019s Accomplishments: by Cassy Fiano Since Donald Trump took office, liberals have immediately been reminiscing about the Obama administration, waxing poetic about how Barack Obama was the greatest president ever to sit in the Oval Office. But how much did Obama really accomplish while president? And was it even good? According to one source, Obama\u2019s accomplishments should make a lot of liberals rethink things.  Barack Obama was the country\u2019s first black president and so for liberals, that was all that mattered. But between 2008 and 2017, he sure did rack up a lot of accomplishments \u2014 although America\u2019s Freedom Fighters points out that they aren\u2019t necessarily good ones. Here are a few of the highlights:  First President to preside over a cut to the credit-rating of the United States. First President to violate the War Powers Act. First President to be held in contempt of court for illegally obstructing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. First President to abrogate bankruptcy law to turn over control of companies to his union supporters. First President to by-pass Congress and implement the Dream Act through executive fiat. First President to order a secret amnesty program that stopped the deportation of illegal immigrants across the U.S., including those with criminal convictions. First President to demand a company hand-over $20 billion to one of his political appointees. First President to tell a CEO of a major corporation (Chrysler) to resign. First President to terminate America\u2019s ability to put a man in space. First President to cancel the National Day of Prayer and to say that America is no longer a Christian nation. First President to have a law signed by an auto-pen without being present. First President to arbitrarily declare an existing law unconstitutional and refuse to enforce it. First President to threaten insurance companies if they publicly spoke out on the reasons for their rate increases. First President to tell a major manufacturing company in which state it is allowed to locate a factory. First President to file lawsuits against the states he swore an oath to protect (AZ, WI, OH, IN). First President to side with a foreign nation over one of the American 50 states (Mexico vs Arizona). First President to tell the military men and women that they should pay for their own private insurance because they \u201cvolunteered to go to war and knew the consequences.\u201d Then he was the First President to tell the members of the military that THEY were UNPATRIOTIC for balking at the last suggestion. (Thank God he didn\u2019t get away with THIS one.) First president to allow Iran to inspect their own facilities. First president to have blood on his hands from Benghazi to the assassinations of several police officers. First president to trade 5 terrorist for a traitor First president to facilitate the Iranians to acquire nuclear weapons.  They also pointed out that Obama has broken quite a few records, too:  But of course, liberals want us to believe that Donald Trump is the dangerous one. Maybe he isn\u2019t the best president in the history of our country, but Obama\u2019s defenders don\u2019t exactly have much room to talk.","label":1}
{"text":"Chelsea Clinton Tweets About \u2018Moms In Prison\u2019 \u2014 Gets Mocked On Twitter Hilariously:  Last year\u2019s presidential election was an intensely passionate divisive national event. Americans of every stripe were adamant about their preferred candidate. And many Americans were hoping one of the candidates would end up in stripes, prison stripes that is. \u2018Hillary for Prison 2016\u2019 signs and stickers graced many front yards and car bumpers. But alas, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s misdeeds did not land her in prison, though many thought she deserved it. Which makes Chelsea Clinton\u2019s recent tweet all the more awkward. See tweet below. No doubt Chelsea has no idea the vitriol and resentment a great many Americans bear toward her mother, for her years and years of alleged lawless deeds and never being held to account for them. But Twitter let her know in a hurry that the irony of a Clinton tweeting about moms in prison, was just too good an opportunity to ignore. The program Chelsea referred to in her tweet is the Girl Scouts of America\u2019s \u201cGirl Scouts Beyond Bars.\u201d It enables young girls in the program to visit their incarcerated mothers, in a room that is more like a classroom instead of a typical prison visitation room. And no doubt the program is a good one that is filling a need. It has probably helped many young ladies to continue a relationship with their mother while she serves her sentence. And certainly no one faults Chelsea for supporting such a program. But of course any reference by Hillary\u2019s daughter to moms in prison is going to bring a big response from Americans who are tired of seeing Democrats get away with things that other Americans would never be able to do without repercussions.  So, to the GSA, good job on this program. It\u2019s a benefit to young girls. But to Chelsea Clinton? There is talk of the DOJ opening investigations into Hillary\u2019s list of questionable activities. And if there is any justice, it may be only a matter of time until you, Chelsea, have to visit your mom in prison.","label":1}

It\u2019s either irony, or some sort of hilarious prank played by Costco, because they know her book is so full of crap. This is absolutely hilarious and for reasons you don\u2019t quite understand, it will have you laughing for hours. The longer you look at it, the harder you will laugh.  From aspirations of life in the White House to signing copies of her books next to something that belongs in an outhouse, Hillary Clinton has had a difficult year. With all of the bullcrap that comes out of her mouth, perhaps Clinton should set up a permanent residence in that aisle. Meanwhile, millennial protestors set up shop across the street to protest the appearance of Hillary, chanting \u201clock her up,\u201d wearing MAGA hats and holding Trump campaign signs. Watch the video below: I genuinely want to feel bad for her, because to be this far along in your life and have absolutely nothing to show for it? That\u2019s just sad. I mean, the only reason she\u2019s even as important enough to sign books in a Costco is because she rode her husband\u2019s coattails to fame. She\u2019s done absolutely nothing to make a name for herself and anything she has done, such as her time as Secretary of State, has ended in abject failure and in the case of SoS, bloodshed. You can\u2019t claim that as a success when your actions got innocent people killed when it could have been avoided. We are watching her decline in relevance and influence in real time, and it\u2019s fabulous. It couldn\u2019t be happening to a nicer witch and I\u2019m sure the Benghazi 4 and her other victims are watching from their perches in Heaven, enjoying some great beer and watching this the way most people would watch a football game. I am just going to kick up my feet and watch her implode while America prospers and thrives under a Presidency that isn\u2019t hers. This is the America that we have dreamed of during the last 8 years of the Obama administration and we\u2019re actually here to witness it. It\u2019s beautiful karmic justice and let\u2019s not pretend she doesn\u2019t deserve it. Even the left needs to recognize that she is a sinking ship and jump off like rats.

In 2001, he was convicted of conspiring to murder a pregnant woman who was carrying his child. Cherica Adams was 8 months pregnant with Carruth\u2019s child and was shot 4 times in the stomach near his home. Adams wasn\u2019t dead and was able to call the police and explained that Carruth had drove in front of her to stop her while another man shot her. She fell into a coma at the hospital and died less than a month later. Carruth fled and was eventually caught hiding in a trunk of a car with $3,900, a cell phone, candy bars and bottles of his own urine.  adamcarolla.com  2.

While the police were investigating possible drug charges against Vick\u2019s cousin, they discovered everything in his backyard. Vick hosted fights at his Virginia home for 6 years before being caught. He bred over 50 dogs and has admitted to shooting, hanging, drowning and electrocuting dogs that didn\u2019t perform well. The news quickly spread and there was a lot of public outrage, especially from animal rights activists, and soon the feds stepped in and slapped Vick and 3 others with felony charges. Vick was sentenced to 23 months in prison for financing the interstate operation and admitting to personally participating in the fights as well.  bet.com 3. Aaron Hernandez Aaron was convicted of the murder of Odin Lloyd, the boyfriend of his fiance\u2019s sister. Lloyd was shot and his body was found only a mile away from Aaron\u2019s house. It was believed that Aaron\u2019s motive for killing Lloyd was that he knew too much information about a drive-by murder that Hernandez was involved with in Boston back in 2012. The drive-by shooting allegedly started over a spilled drink at a club. Hernandez is still awaiting trial for that incident. Again, the murder of two people could have all been started over a SPILLED DRINK. Prosecution had a plethora of evidence pinning Hernandez to Lloyd\u2019s murder, including witnesses, cell phone records and home surveillance video. He was ultimately sentenced to life in prison without parole and in April of 2017, he was found dead in his cell from an apparent suicide.  ibtimes.com 4.

He displayed his sense of humor when he was caught driving drunk after speeding through a stop sign with a female passenger in his car. When the officer pulled him over and asked him why he was in such a hurry, Barkley\u2019s response was that he had received oral sex from the female passenger the week before and it was the best he\u2019s ever had.

He famously shot himself in the leg while dancing at a nightclub in New York City. The gun was apparently slipping down his jeans and when he tried to bring it back up, he accidentally shot himself in his right thigh. He turned himself in 2 days later. The worst part is that he never had a concealed weapon license for New York and the one he had in Florida was expired; making it a felony with a minimum sentence of 3 and a half years in prison. Plax was suspended for the remaining 4 games of the season and missed the entire playoffs. But that was the least of his worries.

Cecil Collins Cecil Collins is probably the most talented player you\u2019ve never heard of. That is because halfway through his rookie season with the Miami Dolphins, the running back was arrested and sent to prison for 15 years. His offense? He broke into a home to watch a woman, who worked out at the same gym as him, sleep. The kicker is that this was the second time he committed this crime.. different woman.. but the same. exact. crime. But apparently he has been thankful for the sentencing because his life was not heading in the right direction back then and during his time in prison, he met the love of his life. It was a woman who was visiting another inmate in the prison and they somehow fell in love and even married while he was still in his blue jumpsuit.  gossipextra.com 11.

{"text":"REPORT: Facebook Group With Alleged Russia Ties Pushed Pro-Trump Rallies: In announcing Sept. 6 that it had found $100,000 in ad buys from \u201cinauthentic\u201d accounts \u201clikely operated out of Russia\u201d during the 2016 campaign, Facebook said that the \u201cvast majority of ads run by these accounts didn\u2019t specifically reference the US presidential election, voting or a particular candidate.\u201d It took the Daily Beast less than a month to find what it believes to be a Russia-linked account that did, in fact, explicitly promote then-GOP candidate Donald Trump. The news website Tuesday surfaced the existence of a Facebook group called \u201cBeing Patriotic,\u201d which the Daily Beast said bears many of the trademarks of other shady Facebook accounts that are believed to have had Russia ties. \u201cBeing Patriotic\u201d went dark around the time Facebook deleted accounts linked to a Russian troll farm, according to the Daily Beast. The social media giant would not confirm to the Daily Beast the group\u2019s Russian origins, but it did not challenge the Beast\u2019s suggestions either. \u201cBeing Patriotic\u201d pushed at least four pro-Trump or anti-Hillary Clinton rallies, according to the Daily Beast, including a flash mob that was promoted to occur simultaneously in 17 different Florida locations. In at least a few cases, those events came to fruition, according to the Beast report, and resulted in known Trump activists showing up and promoting the events on their own social media pages. Facebook\u2019s disclosure of the inauthentic accounts appears to only be the tip of the iceberg of what sort of activity those accounts were involved in, per the Daily Beast:  After The Daily Beast found known Russian accounts that used Facebook\u2019s Events tool to promote rallies inside the United States, the company said that it was not well positioned to determine \u201cif something like coordination occurred\u201d between the Trump campaign and Russia \u2014 something investigators and security researchers doubt because of the social network\u2019s massive trove of information on its customers. But the discovery of the \u201cBeing Patriotic\u201d rallies suggests that the fraudulent activity on Facebook did indeed involve messaging on behalf of Trump, did prompt at least some Americans to rally on Trump\u2019s behalf, and did result in the Trump campaign volunteers subsequently sharing material from those events.  Russia\u2019s use of Facebook in its alleged campaign to interfere with the 2016 election has come under major scrutiny since the disclosure of the inauthentic accounts. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe has reportedly issued a search warrantto learn more about the activity on the site, and the Senate Intelligence Committee has said it would like Facebook to testify publicly about what happened \u2014 a hearing chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) would like to host as early as next month. The Facebook page the Daily Beast identified Wednesday promoted flash mob events in Florida, a key swing state, in August 2016. Two of the planned locations \u2014 Fort Lauderdale and Coral Springs \u2014 were sites of gatherings by Trump fans, according to photos and videos posted by Dolly Trevino Rump, the Trump campaign\u2019s chairwoman for Broward County. Rump did not respond to the Daily Beast\u2019s inquiries. Other people who were listed as contacts on Being Patriotic\u2019s events told the Daily Beast they remembered vaguely being contacted by the group to promote the rallies. Betty Triguera, listed as a coordinator on a Sarasota event page, said she heard about the event from Being Patriotic\u2019s Twitter account \u2014 which has also been shut down, according to the Daily Beast. Jim Frische, whose name was attached to a Clearwater event page, remembered only vague details of being contacted about the event, and that it ended up being \u201ca dozen or so people out on the street corner.\u201d","label":1}
{"text":"14 Times Trump Warned Against Doing What He Just Did in Afghanistan: ( ANTIMEDIA) \u2014 On the same day millions of Americans were thrilled to witness \u2014 and equally distracted by \u2014 a total solar eclipse, Donald Trump decided it was time to announce a \u201cdramatically different\u201d foreign policy plan for the U.S. military in Afghanistan. Just how \u201cdifferent\u201d is Trump\u2019s new plan? In reality, the \u2018new\u2019 plan is simply more of the same failed policy of the past, one Trump promised to put an end to numerous times over the years prior to moving into the White House. The only difference is the childish language Trump used to justify the decision, repeatedly vowing to \u201cwin\u201d the same conflict James Mattis told Congress \u201cwe are not winning\u201d back in June. On Monday, August 21, 2017, Trump revealed to Fox News that he had signed off on sending 4,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in what is officially the longest war in the history of the United States. Early Tuesday morning, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg praised Trump\u2019s decision to commit more soldiers to fight on the ground in Afghanistan, reminding allies that NATO is fully committed to backing the \u2018new\u2019 plan:  \u201cNATO remains fully committed to Afghanistan and I am looking forward to discussing the way ahead with [U.S. Defense] Secretary [James] Mattis and our allies and international partners,\u201d Stoltenberg said in a statement.  America\u2019s favorite war hawk, John McCain, also praised President Trump\u2019s strategy for Afghanistan. He said in a statement that he believes \u201cthe President is now moving us well beyond the prior administration\u2019s failed strategy of merely postponing defeat,\u201d also noting that Trump faces the challenge of keeping \u201cthe right level of effort, in the right places, with the right authorities and resources to see this conflict through to success.\u201d He continued:  \u201cTo do this, the President must conduct himself as a wartime commander-in-chief. He must speak regularly to the American people, and to those waging this war on their behalf, about why we are fighting, why the additional sacrifices are worth it, and how we will success.\u201d  On Fox News, Lindsey Graham said he was \u201cproud\u201d of Donald Trump\u2019s decision:  \u201cPresident Trump has the smarts and the moral courage to listen to his generals and take their advice rather than go the political way.\u201d  Despite such fawning praise, the president is now contradicting multiple previous statements he made on the quagmire in Afghanistan.

{"text":"Happy Birthday CIA: 7 Truly Terrible Things the Agency Has Done in 70 Years: ( ANTIMEDIA Op-ed) \u2014 On Monday, President Trump tweeted birthday wishes to the Air Force and the CIA. Both became official organizations 70 years ago on September 18, 1947, with the implementation of the National Security Act of 1947. After spending years as a wartime intelligence agency called the Office of Strategic Services, the agency was solidified as a key player in the federal government\u2019s operations with then-President Harry Truman\u2019s authorization. In the seventy years since, the CIA has committed a wide variety of misdeeds, crimes, coups, and violence. Here are seven of the worst programs they\u2019ve carried out (that are known to the public): Toppling governments around the world \u2014 The CIA is best known for its first coup, Operation Ajax, in 1953, in which it ousted the democratically elected leader of Iran, Mohammed Mossadegh, reinstating the autocratic Shah, who favored western oil interests. That operation, which the CIA now admits to waging with British intelligence, ultimately resulted in the 1979 revolution and subsequent U.S. hostage crisis. Relations between the U.S. and Iran remain strained to this day, aptly described by the CIA-coined term \u201c blowback.\u201d But the CIA has had a hand in toppling a number of other democratically elected governments, from Guatemala (1954) and the Congo (1960) to the Dominican Republic (1961), South Vietnam (1963), Brazil (1964), and Chile (1973). The CIA has aimed to install leaders who appease American interests, often empowering oppressive, violent dictators. This is only a partial list of countries where the CIA covertly attempted to exploit and manipulate sovereign nations\u2019 governments. Operation Paperclip \u2014 In one of the more bizarre CIA plots, the agency and other government departments employed Nazi scientists both within and outside the United States to gain an advantage over the Soviets. As summarized by NPR: \u201cThe aim [of Operation Paperclip] was to find and preserve German weapons, including biological and chemical agents, but American scientific intelligence officers quickly realized the weapons themselves were not enough. \u201cThey decided the United States needed to bring the Nazi scientists themselves to the U.S. Thus began a mission to recruit top Nazi doctors, physicists and chemists \u2014 including Wernher von Braun, who went on to design the rockets that took man to the moon.\u201d They kept this plot secret, though they admitted to it upon the release of Operation Paperclip: The Secret Intelligence Program That Brought Nazi Scientists To America by Annie Jacobsen. In a book review, the CIA wrote that \u201cHenry Wallace, former vice president and secretary of commerce, believed the scientists\u2019 ideas could launch new civilian industries and produce jobs.\u201d They praised the book\u2019s historical accuracy, noting \u201cthat the Launch Operations Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida, was headed by Kurt Debus, an ardent Nazi.\u201d They acknowledged that \u201cGeneral Reinhard Gehlen, former head of Nazi intelligence operations against the Soviets, was hired by the US Army and later by the CIA to operate 600 ex-Nazi agents in the Soviet zone of occupied Germany.\u201d Remarkably, they noted that Jacobsen \u201cunderstandably questions the morality of the decision to hire Nazi SS scientists,\u201d but praise her for pointing out that it was done to fight Soviets. They also made sure to add that the Soviets hired Nazis, too, apparently justifying their own questionable actions by citing their most loathed enemy. Operation CHAOS \u2014 The FBI is widely known for its COINTELPRO schemes to undermine communist movements in the 1950s and anti-war, civil rights, and black power movements in the 1960s, but the CIA has not been implicated nearly as deeply because, technically, the CIA cannot legally engage in domestic spying. But that was of little concern to President Lyndon B. Johnson as opposition to the Vietnam war grew. According to former New York Times journalist and Pulitzer Prize-winner Tim Weiner, as documented in his extensive CIA history, Legacy of Ashes, Johnson instructed then-CIA Director Richard Helms to break the law: \u201cIn October 1967, a handful of CIA analysts joined in the first big Washington march against the war. The president regarded protesters as enemies of the state. He was convinced that the peace movement was controlled and financed by Moscow and Beijing. He wanted proof. He ordered Richard Helms to produce it. \u201cHelms reminded the president that the CIA was barred from spying on Americans. He says Johnson told him: \u2018I\u2019m quite aware of that. What I want for you is to pursue this matter, and to do what is necessary to track down the foreign communists who are behind this intolerable interference in our domestic affairs\u2026\u2019\u201d Helms obeyed. Weiner wrote: \u201cIn a blatant violation of his powers under the law, the director of central intelligence became a part-time secret police chief. The CIA undertook a domestic surveillance operation, code-named Chaos. It went on for almost seven years\u2026 Eleven CIA officers grew long hair, learned the jargon of the New Left, and went off to infiltrate peace groups in the United States and Europe.\u201d According to Weiner, \u201cthe agency compiled a computer index of 300,000 names of American people and organizations, and extensive files on 7,200 citizens. It began working in secret with police departments all over America.\u201d Because they could not draw a \u201cclear distinction\u201d between the new far left and mainstream opposition to the war, the CIA spied on every major peace organization in the country. President Johnson also wanted them to prove a connection between foreign communists and the black power movement. \u201cThe agency tried its best,\u201d Weiner noted, ultimately noting that \u201cthe CIA never found a shred of evidence that linked the leaders of the American left or the black-power movement to foreign governments.\u201d Infiltrating the media \u2014 Over the years, the CIA has successfully gained influence in the news media, as well as popular media like film and television. Its influence over the news began almost immediately after the agency was formed. As Weiner explained, CIA Director Allen Dulles established firm ties with newspapers: \u201cDulles kept in close touch with the men who ran the New York Times, The Washington Post, and the nation\u2019s leading weekly magazines. He could pick up the phone and edit a breaking story, make sure an irritating foreign correspondent was yanked from the field, or hire the services of men such as Time\u2019s Berlin bureau chief and Newsweek\u2019s man in Tokyo.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt was second nature for Dulles to plant stories in the press. American newsrooms were dominated by veterans of the government\u2019s wartime propaganda branch, the Office of War Information\u2026The men who responded to the CIA\u2019s call included Henry Luce and his editors at Time, Life, and Fortune; popular magazines such as Parade, the Saturday Review, and Reader\u2019s Digest; and the most powerful executives at CBS News. Dulles built a public-relations and propaganda machine that came to include more than fifty news organizations, a dozen publishing houses, and personal pledges of support from men such as Axel Springer, West Germany\u2019s most powerful press baron.\u201d The CIA\u2019s influence had not waned by 1977 when journalist Carl Bernstein reported on publications with CIA agents in their employ, as well as \u201cmore than 400 American journalists who in the past twenty\u2011five years have secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency.\u201d The CIA has also successfully advised on and influenced numerous television shows, such as Homeland and 24 and films like Zero Dark Thirty and Argo, which push narratives that ultimately favor the agency. According to Tricia Jenkins, author of The CIA in Hollywood: How the Agency Shapes Film  ; Television, a concerted agency effort began in the 1990s to counteract negative public perceptions of the CIA, but their influence reaches back decades. In the 1950s, filmmakers produced films for the CIA, including the 1954 film adaptation of George Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm. Researchers Tom Secker and Matthew Alford, whose work has been published in the American Journal of Economics and Sociology, say their recent Freedom of Information Act requests have shown that the CIA \u2014 along with the military \u2014 have influenced over 1,800 films and television shows, many of which have nothing to do with CIA or military themes. Drug-induced Mind control \u2013 In the 1950s, the CIA began experimenting with drugs to determine whether they might be useful in extracting information. As Smithsonian Magazine has noted of the MKUltra project: \u201cThe project, which continued for more than a decade, was originally intended to make sure the United States government kept up with presumed Soviet advances in mind-control technology. It ballooned in scope and its ultimate result, among other things, was illegal drug testing on thousands of Americans.\u201d Further: \u201cThe intent of the project was to study \u2018the use of biological and chemical materials in altering human behavior,\u2019 according to the official testimony of CIA director Stansfield Turner in 1977. The project was conducted in extreme secrecy, Turner said, because of ethical and legal questions surrounding the program and the negative public response that the CIA anticipated if MKUltra should become public. \u201cUnder MKUltra, the CIA gave itself the authority to research how drugs could:\u2019 \u2018promote the intoxicating effects of alcohol;\u2019 \u2018render the induction of hypnosis easier;\u2019 \u2018enhance the ability of individuals to withstand privation, torture and coercion;\u2019 produce amnesia, shock and confusion; and much more. Many of these questions were investigated using unwitting test subjects, like drug-addicted prisoners, marginalized sex workers and terminal cancer patients\u2013 \u2018people who could not fight back,\u2019 in the words of Sidney Gottlieb, the chemist who introduced LSD to the CIA.\u201d Further, as Weiner noted: \u201cUnder its auspices, seven prisoners at a federal penitentiary in Kentucky were kept high on LSD for seventy-seven consecutive days. When the CIA slipped the same drug to an army civilian employee, Frank Olson, he leaped out of the window of a New York Hotel.\u201d Weiner added that senior CIA officers destroyed \u201calmost all of the records\u201d of the programs, but that while the \u201cevidence that remains is fragmentary\u2026it strongly suggests that use of secret prisons for the forcible drug-induced questioning of suspect agents went on throughout the 1950s.\u201d Years later, the CIA would be accused of distributing crack-cocaine into poor black communities, though this is currently less substantiated and supported mostly by accounts of those who claim to have been involved. Brutal torture tactics \u2014 More recently, the CIA was exposed for sponsoring abusive, disturbing terror tactics against detainees at prisons housing terror suspects. An extensive 2014 Senate report documented agents committing sexual abuse, forcing detainees to stand on broken legs, waterboarding them so severely it sometimes led to convulsions, and imposing forced rectal feeding, to name a few examples. Ultimately, the agency had very little actionable intelligence to show for their torture tactics but lied to suggest they did, according to the torture report. Their torture tactics led the International Criminal Court to suggest the CIA, along with the U.S. armed forces, could be guilty of war crimes for their abuses. Arming radicals \u2014 The CIA has a long habit of arming radical, extremist groups that view the United States as enemies. In 1979, the CIA set out to support Afghan rebels in their bid to defeat the Soviet occupation of the Middle Eastern country. As Weiner wrote, in 1979, \u201cPrompted by Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter signed a covert-action order for the CIA to provide the Afghan rebels with medical aid, money, and propaganda.\u201d As Weiner detailed later in his book: \u201cThe Pakistani intelligence chiefs who doled out the CIA\u2019s guns and money favored the Afghan factions who proved themselves most capable in battle. Those factions also happened to be the most committed Islamists. No one dreamed that the holy warriors could ever turn their jihad against the United States.\u201d  Though some speculate the CIA directly armed Osama bin Laden, that is yet to be fully proven or admitted. What is clear is that western media revered him as a valuable fighter against the Soviets, that he arrived to fight in Afghanistan in1980, and that al-Qaeda emerged from the mujahideen, who were beneficiaries of the CIA\u2019s program. Stanford University has noted that Bin Laden and Abdullah Azzam, a prominent Palestinian cleric, \u201cestablished Al Qaeda from the fighters, financial resources, and training and recruiting structures left over from the anti-Soviet war.\u201d Much of those \u201cstructures\u201d were provided by the agency. Intentionally or not, the CIA helped fuel the rise of the terror group. Weiner noted that as the CIA failed in other countries like Libya, by the late 1980s \u201cOnly the mujahideen, the Afghan holy warriors, were drawing blood and scenting victory. The CIA\u2019s Afghan operation was now a $700-million-dollar-a-year-program\u201d and represented 80% of the overseas budget of the clandestine services. \u201cThe CIA\u2019s briefing books never answered the question of what would happen when a militant Islamic army defeated the godless invaders of Afghanistan,\u201d though Tom Twetten, \u201cthe number two man in the clandestine service in the summer of 1988,\u201d was tasked with figuring out what would happen with the Afghan rebels. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any plan,\u201d he concluded. Apparently failing to learn their lesson, the CIA adopted nearly the exact same policy in Syria decades later, arming what they called \u201cmoderate rebels\u201d against the Assad regime. Those groups ultimately aligned with al-Qaeda groups. One CIA-backed faction made headlines last year for beheading a child (though President Trump cut off the CIA program in June, the military continues to align with \u201cmoderate\u201d groups). Unsurprisingly, this list is far from complete. The CIA has engaged in a wide variety of extrajudicial practice, and there are likely countless transgressions we have yet to learn about. As Donald Trump cheers the birthday of an agency he himself once criticized, it should be abundantly clear that the nation\u2019s covert spy agency deserves scrutiny and skepticism \u2014 not celebration.","label":1}
{"text":"Why Trump Should Consider a Post-Twitter Presidency: (Reuters photo: Kevin Lamarque) Almost every supposedly informed prediction about President Donald Trump\u2019s compulsive Twitter addiction has so far proved wrong. He did not tweet his way out of the Republican nomination. Spontaneous social-media messaging did not lose Trump the general election race with Hillary Clinton. Nor has Trump tweeted his presidency into oblivion. Instead, Trump\u2019s tweets have not just bypassed the mostly progressive media; they\u2019ve sent it into a tizzy. In near-suicidal fashion, networks such as CNN have melted down in hatred of Trump, goaded on by Trump\u2019s Twitter digs. Trump has often bragged that having a large following on social media \u2014 he has more than 44 million Twitter followers and connects with millions more via Facebook and Instagram \u2014 is \u201clike having your own newspaper.\u201d He has a point. While the media goes ballistic over Trump\u2019s inflammatory Twitter attacks on \u201cfake news,\u201d the vast majority of Trump\u2019s electronic messaging simply reports on his daily activities and various agendas. Trump has created a Twitter empire with a reach that far exceeds the combined subscriber base of the New York Times and Washington Post, and he has vastly expanded on Barack Obama\u2019s use of a presidential Twitter feed to connect with voters. Almost all of the people who have climbed into the Twitter ring with Trump \u2014 from Hillary Clinton to the take-a-knee millionaire National Football League players \u2014 have come out on the losing end. Trump has proven far better than seasoned journalists and ego-driven celebrities at creating go-for-the-jugular put-downs of 240 characters or less. Trump\u2019s stream-of-conscious Twitter observations have sometimes proved eerily prescient. He tweeted warnings about the dangers of illegal immigration shortly before the tragic murder of Kate Steinle by an undocumented immigrant with a lengthy criminal record. Soon after Trump retweeted incendiary and controversial videos about radical Islamic violence, earning him condemnation from British prime minister Theresa May, it was announced that two men had been arrested in London for plotting a terrorist attack and assassination \u2014 of none other than May herself. Why, then, should Trump ever consider pruning back his controversial tweets or confining them to the reportage of his daily achievements, in the manner of every other mostly boring politician? Because personal dueling with journalists, celebrities, and politicians is not only becoming superfluous, but it is now distracting Trump\u2019s audiences from a growing record of achievement. Nine months ago, critics left and right were writing off Trump as an irrelevant buffoon without a clue of what to do in the White House. They predicted perennial sloth and inaction. Not now. Trump\u2019s Cabinet and judicial appointments, executive orders, and deregulation measures are systematically overturning the progressive Obama project. Abroad, the Trump national-security team has recalibrated U.S. foreign policy from an apologetic recessional to engaged, principled realism. Republican politicians once grumbled about the utopian Paris climate accord but never thought of doing much about it. Trump, like him or hate him, summarily withdrew America from the agreement \u2014 and shrugged off the ensuing green outrage. Members of Congress occasionally expressed support for the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel \u2014 but on the expectation that no barnstorming candidate would ever dare to officially recognize Jerusalem as such if elected president. Prior to 2017, conventional economic wisdom dictated that the Dow Jones industrial average would not soon climb above 22,000, that the unemployment rate in peacetime could not fall to 4 percent, and that the GDP could not grow at an annual rate of 3 percent. All those shibboleths have either been blown up or may yet be blown up in 2018. Trump is no longer written off by the Left as a sleepy dud. Instead, he suddenly is being redefined by many of his progressive enemies as a dangerous workaholic and right-wing revolutionary. Never-Trump Republicans no longer insist that Trump is a liberal Manhattan wolf in conservative sheep\u2019s clothing. Grudgingly, they now confess that he is ramming through a conservative agenda not seen since the days of their heartthrob, Ronald Reagan. In other words, Trump\u2019s record speaks louder than his tweets and now transcends his electronic spats. So why should Trump still care what a minor journalist tweets about him to get much-needed attention? Why does the president need to keep pounding increasingly irrelevant former FBI director James Comey, who has been reduced to tweeting anti-Trump slogans? Trump\u2019s record has now transcended his Twitter ankle-biters, who have become ever shriller in seeking attention in the form of electronic counter-put-downs. In sum, Trump has outgrown the Twitter wars. He should now just declare victory, retire as Twitter champ, hang up his tweeting gloves, and leave the slap-down ring for others. READ MORE:","label":1}
{"text":"Kennedy, Clinton, and Weinstein: A Convenient Reckoning: Bill Clinton campaigns for Hillary in Montgomery County, Pa., October 2016. (Reuters photo: Dominick Reuter) Now it\u2019s safe to denounce the worst acts of serial abusers on the left side of the aisle. In April, the historical drama Chappaquiddick will arrive in theaters. Variety declared the film \u201ca tense, scrupulous, absorbingly precise and authentic piece of history \u2014 a tabloid scandal attached to a smoke-filled-room travesty.\u201d The reviewer, Owen Gleiberman, suggested that the film could spur a dramatic reevaluation of the Liberal Lion of the Senate:  Ted Kennedy should, by all rights, have stood trial for involuntary manslaughter, which would likely have ended his political career. The fact that the Kennedy family \u2014 the original postwar dynasty of the one percent \u2014 possessed, and exerted, the influence to squash the case is the essence of what Chappaquiddick means. The Kennedys lived outside the law . . . those are the facts, and they are facts that liberals, too often, have been willing to shove under the carpet.  If you\u2019re a Kennedy critic, or just fume at a famous senator enjoying the sort of legal unaccountability usually reserved for Heisman Trophy\u2013winning USC running backs, this film will constitute a form of justice, correcting the record and tearing down the mythical fa\u00e7ade. But it\u2019s a rather convenient one for Ted Kennedy, as he died in 2009. Considering the ongoing reverence for the Kennedy family in so many powerful circles in this country, Chappaquiddick is a brave film. But it would have been much braver \u2014 perhaps impossible to make \u2014 a decade ago. If the spring brings a reevaluation of Ted Kennedy, it will probably come on the heels of a sudden and dramatic reevaluation of Bill Clinton as a consequence of the explosion of sexual-harassment and assault allegations in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. New York Times opinion columnist Michelle Goldberg wrote Tuesday:  Of the Clinton accusers, the one who haunts me is [Juanita] Broaddrick. The story she tells about Clinton recalls those we\u2019ve heard about Weinstein. She claimed they had plans to meet in a hotel coffee shop, but at the last minute he asked to come up to her hotel room instead, where he raped her. Five witnesses said she confided in them about the assault right after it happened. It\u2019s true that she denied the rape in an affidavit to Paula Jones\u2019s lawyers, before changing her story when talking to federal investigators. But her explanation, that she didn\u2019t want to go public but couldn\u2019t lie to the F.B.I., makes sense. Put simply, I believe her.  A New York Times columnist declaring in print that she believes the 42nd president of the United States is a rapist ought to make people stop and think. But since we\u2019re seeing a tide of slime from predatory men gradually oozing out of Hollywood studios, television networks, and state capitals, it seems fair to ask whether Clinton\u2019s experience left many powerful and abusive men convinced that they could escape serious consequence.  It seems fair to ask whether Bill Clinton\u2019s experience left many powerful and abusive men convinced that they could escape serious consequence.  Another New York Times columnist, David Brooks, asked a question on Charlie Rose a week ago that should leave Democrats awake at night: \u201cHow much did tolerance of Bill Clinton create the environment in which the rest of this was given permission?\u201d The United States had seen infamous and widely covered allegations of sexual harassment before, most notably in the confirmation hearing of Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas and the forced resignation of Oregon GOP senator Bob Packwood. But in January 1998, the Monica Lewinsky scandal set off a year-long national discussion, one that occasionally noted the mounting pile of accusations of sexual misconduct: Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, and Paula Jones. The Clinton machine smeared the women viciously, with James Carville nastily declaring, \u201cDrag a hundred-dollar bill through a trailer park and you never know what you\u2019ll find.\u201d It\u2019s worth remembering the infamous Clinton-finger-wagging moment, when he addressed a skeptical nation and vehemently denied the nature of his encounters with Lewinsky: \u201cI did not . . . have . . . sexual . . . relations with that woman . . . Miss Lewinsky, and I never told anybody to lie.\u201d He did so because in January 1998, admitting to even a consensual relationship with 22-year-old White House intern would have spurred bipartisan demands for his resignation. There was a time when there was a broad cultural consensus that a man in a powerful position is not supposed to look upon his female subordinates as a potential harem. And if Clinton saw Lewinsky as a sexual plaything in the workplace, it\u2019s plausible he could have been less concerned about consent from other women in earlier years. A few days ago, Matt Yglesias of Vox articulated what was heresy on the Left during those years: \u201cI wonder how much healthier a place we\u2019d be in as a society today if Bill Clinton had resigned in shame back in 1998.\u201d (One of the great ironies is that if Clinton had resigned and Al Gore had become president, Gore probably would\u2019ve had a greater advantage in the 2000 election. Gore reportedly confronted Clinton forcefully after the 2000 recount and blamed Clinton for his defeat.) Was Bill Clinton a role model for how men can indulge their worst impulses and get away with it? Since the 1990s, how many men in powerful positions have seen Bill Clinton in that light? After all, all sorts of powerful people \u2014 from prominent feminists to powerful lawyers to the leaders of Clinton\u2019s party \u2014 came to the consensus that the whole Lewinsky mess was a \u201cprivate matter.\u201d Perhaps the affair with her was \u2014 although Americans are right to expect better from a president \u2014 but the claims of Jones, Willey, and Broaddrick were not private matters in the slightest. After the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke, Lee Smith, writing in The Weekly Standard, asked a difficult question that few Democrats will really want to confront. Would the enormously consequential New York Times article detailing the accusations about the Hollywood producer have been published if the 2016 election had ended differently and Weinstein had the president of the United States on speed-dial?  The court over which Bill Clinton once presided, a court in which Weinstein was one part jester, one part exchequer, and one part executioner, no longer exists. . . . If the story was published during the course of a Hillary Clinton presidency, it wouldn\u2019t have really been about Harvey Weinstein. Harvey would have been seen as a proxy for the president\u2019s husband and it would have embarrassed the president, the first female president.  We\u2019ll never know how events would have played out in that alternative reality. Considering Weinstein\u2019s far-reaching and ferocious efforts to discourage reporting about his abuses, it\u2019s easy to believe that he would seek out assistance from the Clintons as the Times reporters closed in. Right now, we are indeed having a reckoning about a longtime blind eye to powerful men abusing women, but it\u2019s occurring on the most convenient terms for the Democratic party \u2014 when Kennedy is dead, Bill Clinton is retired and fading into memory, Hillary\u2019s prospects are done, and her closest network of supporters now largely live on the ash heap of American political history. Funny how all of this worked out so conveniently for the party. READ MORE: Jim Geraghty \u2014 Jim Geraghty is the senior political correspondent of National Review. @jimgeraghty","label":1}

Mike Pence has promised the U.S. administration will not ignore the \u201cheroic resistance of the Iranian people\u201d following a series of mass demonstrations in cities across the Islamic Republic of Iran. The vice president also took a sly dig at the Obama administration, which acted cautiously during similar protests in Iran in 2009, stating he and Trump would not be repeating the \u201cshameful\u201d mistakes of the past in ignoring the uprising. In a series of tweets on Monday, Pence said: \u201cAs long as @RealDonaldTrump is POTUS and I am VP, the United States of America will not repeat the shameful mistake of our past when others stood by and ignored the heroic resistance of the Iranian people as they fought against their brutal regime.\u201d \u201cThe bold and growing resistance of the Iranian people today gives hope and faith to all who struggle for freedom and against tyranny.

(1\/2)\u2014 Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) January 1, 2018   (2\/2)...The bold and growing resistance of the Iranian people today gives hope and faith to all who struggle for freedom and against tyranny. We must not and we will not let them down. #IranProtests\u2014 Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) January 1, 2018  The vice president\u2019s comments echo those of the Trump administration\u2019s, whose vocal support for the demonstrators takes a different tack to that used by former President Barack Obama and has been slammed by Tehran. Tweeting about the events in Iran that began last Thursday, the president wrote: \u201cIran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years.\u201d \u201cThey are hungry for food  ; for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!\u201d he added. The protests that have spread across Iranian cities over the past four days are the largest since 2009, when the country\u2019s disputed re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to mass protests known as the Green Movement. Thousands of people were arrested during the ongoing demonstrations in 2009, and official Iranian figures state more than 30 people were killed in the clashes. Unconfirmed reports from opposition supporters suggest the death toll was more than twice the number than that of the officially recognized figure. At the time, then-U.S. President Obama took a cautious approach to the demonstrations in Iran, warning that the administration should not be seen as \u201cmeddling\u201d in Iranian affairs. \u201cIt is up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran\u2019s leaders will be,\u201d CNN reported Obama stating in June 2009. \u201cWe respect Iranian sovereignty and want to avoid the United States being the issue inside of Iran, which sometimes the United States can be a handy political football,\u201d he added. Although Obama warned against violence toward protesters, and several days after the protests broke out condemned the shooting of one demonstrator, his initial reaction was perceived by some to be slow off the mark. Others argued that by failing to back the protests, Obama avoided giving Tehran an excuse to claim they were orchestrated by the U.S. The recent demonstrations have seen at least 10 people killed in violent clashes that have reportedly seen riot police open fire on demonstrators. Hundreds of people are believed to have been arrested, while access to social media appears to have been restricted by the government. Iranian citizens have been warned they will \u201cface the nation\u2019s iron fist\u201d if demonstrations continue. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi on Saturday also accused the U.S. of being \u201copportunistic\u201d in its support for demonstrators, stating: \u201cThe great Iranian nation regards the opportunist and duplicitous support of the American officials for certain gatherings over the recent days in some Iranian cities as nothing but [part of] the deceit and hypocrisy of the U.S. administration.\u201d \u201cThe Iranian people attach no value to the opportunistic remarks by American officials and [President Donald] Trump himself,\u201d he added, according to the semiofficial Tasnim News Agency, calling U.S. statements \u201ccheap, worthless and invalid.\u201d","label":1}

Among them: The Social Security Administration rule labeling some Supplemental Security Income and Disability (SSI) recipients as \u201cmental defectives\u201d and reporting them to the FBI\u2019s gun ban database. Under the rule, possession of firearms by these \u201cmentally defective\u201d individuals \u2014 as many as 75,000 law-abiding citizens, including veterans \u2014 could be prosecuted as a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.

The poorly written rule could potentially affect anyone who receives benefits and has a representative payee who helps them manage their SSA funds. More than 91,000 comments were submitted on the rule, the overwhelming majority of them in opposition to it. NRA-ILA Executive Director Chris Cox, in a Jan 26 press release, praised Congress\u2019s intent to review the rule under the CRA. \u201cCongress\u2019 decision to review the Obama administration\u2019s back-door gun grab is a significant step forward in protecting a fundamental constitutional right for law-abiding gun owners,\u201d he said.

In mid-January, President Trump announced that he would submit the name of that nominee to the Senate on Thursday, Feb. 2. According to numerous sources, the ultimate nominee will be one of three finalists gleaned from that list of 21 judges. They are: 11th Circuit Judge William Pryor, 10th Circuit Judge Neil Gorsuch and 3rd Circuit Judge Thomas Hardiman. All three were appointed to the federal appellate bench by President George W. Bush, are described as Constitutional \u201coriginalists\u201d \u2014 as Scalia was \u2014 and have met with Trump. On Jan. 26, Trump told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity that he has \u201cmade my decision pretty much in my mind\" about which one of the three finalist he will select, but did not want tip his hand until Thursday. \"That's subject to change at the last moment,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I think this will be a great choice.\u201d That same evening, Fox News\u2019 Bill Mears, citing unnamed Trump administration sources, wrote that the short-list had been whittled down to two names \u2014 Gorsuch and Hardiman. Here are brief summaries of the final three, even if there are only two finalists: \u2014 Hardiman, 51, a University of Notre Dame graduate who received law degree from Georgetown University, he drove a taxi to pay for his college tuition and may benefit from an endorsement by Trump\u2019s sister, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, who sits on the 3rd Circuit Court in Philadelphia with him. Of the three, Hardiman has the most extensive record of pro-gun rights rulings. According to SCOTUS Blog, he dissented in a court ruling upholding a New Jersey law mandating potential gun owners show \"justifiable need\" to carry a handgun in public, backed a decision that said non-violent felons enjoy the Second Amendment right carry a weapon, and has written that the constitutional right \"to keep and bear arms\" extends beyond the home for self-protection. \u2014 Gorsuch, 49, graduated from Columbia University and studied law at Harvard and has a Doctorate of Legal Philosophy from Oxford University. He is the only Ivy League-educated lawyer among the final three. Gorsuch, whose late mother was President Ronald Reagan's EPA administrator, is notable for his \"Scalia-ness,\u201d with some legal scholars calling him as \u201cthe most natural replacement for late Justice Antonin Scalia,\u201d according to SCOTUS Blog. \u2014 Pryor, 54, graduated from Northeast Louisiana University and received his law degree from Tulane University. Like Trump\u2019s U.S. Attorney General nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions, he is a former Alabama State Attorney General. Of the three, Pryor has been the most outspoken proponent of conservative issues. While Alabama AG, he wrote a brief defending Texas\u2019s anti-sodomy law that was later struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court and he has called the Roe v. Wade ruling the \u201cworst abomination in the history of constitutional law.\u201d For more, go to: \u2014 Down to two: A look at who President Trump might tap for the Supreme Court $10 \u2018Mandatory Orwellian Device\u2019 could thwart California \u2018assault weapon\u2019 law A California man has invented a simple part he hopes to sell for $10 that thwarts draconian (and blatantly unconstitutional) new \u201cassault weapons\u201d law. New gun laws in California have gun enthusiasts and companies looking for ways to make guns, like an AR-15, compliant with the law while still retaining a relatively quick and simple way to remove a magazine. A California law that went into effect Jan. 1 and defines \u201cassault weapons\u201d as any semi-automatic center fire rifle, such as an AR-15, that does not have a fixed magazine and features such as a flash suppresser and pistol grip. But inventor John Bastiani of Bastiani Arms says his firm has developed a product that can modify an AR so it is California compliant, while still allowing it to be disassembled quickly to take out the magazine, for $10. \u201cThings that are on the market now cost upwards of $50, per gun to convert and make them legal,\u201d he told Bob Owens of Bearingarms.com. \u201cThere needs to be a cheap solution. There might be people out there with 10 guns that they need to convert and at $50 per gun that\u2019s cost prohibitive.\u201d Bastiani and friend Mike Schroeder researched and designed parts that they could patent. Ultimately, like most good ideas, the solution was relatively simple: They replaced the bolt catch on the left side of the gun. \u201cI cut some stainless steel\u2026 traced around, laid it out, cut it out with a dremel and a file, put it in the gun and said, \u2018Oh my god, it actually does what I thought it would!\u2019,\u201d he told Owens. \u201cWe kind of lucked out because no one was thinking of the side of the gun we developed our lock for.\u201d Bastiani said the part \u2014 which he has named MOD1 for \u201cMandatory Orwellian Device\u201d \u2014 should only cost around $10 and would fit on any AR. \u201cThis is something that is legally necessary if you don\u2019t desire to register your weapon as an assault weapon,\u201d he told Owens. \u201cIt requires no skill at all to install.\u201d Too bad uninstalling California\u2019s \u201cassault weapon\u201d laws wasn\u2019t equally as simple.

According to Fox\u2019s determination, local governments in Montana are limited to regulating where gun owners can concealed carry, not how they can purchase firearms. \u201cPlainly interpreted, the Montana Legislature has prohibited all forms of local government from exercising any regulatory power over the purchase, sale or transfer of firearms,\u201d Fox wrote in his ruling.

From the Washington Post:  Last week, I sent a string of relatively uncontroversial tweets in the aftermath of the Las Vegas massacre, in which I sought to answer a question about mass shootings in the United States: Why are these crimes almost always carried out by white men? \u201cIt\u2019s the white supremacist patriarchy, stupid,\u201d I tweeted, before then diagnosing a sense of double entitlement \u2014 as white people and as men \u2014 that, when frustrated, can occasionally lead to violent consequences. My argument was not new, but rather reflects decades of research on how race and gender function in our society. To be both white and male is to be subject to a potent cocktail of entitlement to economic and political power, and to dominate nonwhite and female bodies. When that entitlement is frustrated, it can lead to what the criminologist Mike King calls \u201caggrieved whiteness,\u201d an ambient furor based on the idea that white Americans have become oppressed victims of politically correct multiculturalism.

{"text":"Another Media Cover Up: Israel\u2019s Attack on the USS Liberty: Units of the US Sixth Fleet assist the USS Liberty after it was attacked and seriously damaged by the Israeli Air Force off the Sinai Peninsula on June 8, 1967. ( The US downing of an Iranian commercial airliner in 1988, killing 290 civilians, is not the only story that our mainstream media have chosen to forget. In his recent FPJ piece (\u201c The \u2018Forgotten\u2019 US Shootdown of Iranian Airline Flight 655\u201d), publisher and editor Jeremy R.Hammond notes that \u201cin the rare instances when the media do mention it, to this day they tend to maintain official US government falsehoods about what occurred and otherwise omit relevant details that would inform Americans about what really happened.\u201d The same can be said of the media\u2019s treatment of Israel\u2019s 1967 attack on the USS Liberty, which killed 34 American sailors and injured 174 more. A search of the New York Times archive reveals only two brief entries for the topic \u201cUSS Liberty.\u201d A June 14, 1967 report of an LBJ press conference [six days after the attack] includes the following Q  ; A:  \u201cDo you have any more facts you can release on the attack on the USS Liberty? A. \u201cNo, I think you know about as much about it as we do.\u201d  Another article on June 5, 1982 refers to the attack and Israel\u2019s apology, adding only that some survivors refuse to accept the official explanation of \u201cmistake.\u201d What could have inspired the virtual press boycott of such a major story involving American casualties? Believing that the 50th anniversary of the attack deserved appropriate remembrance, I emailed the following letter to editors of the New York Times, Washington Post and Guardian, US on June 5-6: \u201cTo the Editor,  June 8th marks the 50th anniversary of the brazen and deliberate attack by Israel on the USS Liberty, a lightly armed intelligence-gathering ship in international waters off the coast of Egypt. On that afternoon during the Six Day War in 1967 waves of Israeli jets attacked the Liberty without warning. A subsequent barrage from three torpedo boats nearly sank the ship, while the two attacks killed 34 American sailors and injured 174 others. According to Paul Craig Roberts of the Institute for Political Economy, who interviewed survivors and government officials, President Lyndon B. Johnson not only aborted an American rescue mission, but also ordered a cover-up of the whole affair. He reportedly said he \u201cwasn\u2019t going to embarrass an ally.\u201d Notwithstanding the damning conclusions of the Moorer Commission in 2003, no subsequent US administration has dared break an apparent vow of silence. It\u2019s time to honor both Liberty\u2019s victims and remaining survivors. It\u2019s time to tell the American people what happened on that day and why.\u201d  None of those leading US journals included my letter above in their pages. In a June 27 email to Times Middle East correspondent Ben Hubbard, I noted that the 50th anniversary of the Israeli attacks on the USS Liberty had passed without recognition and \u201cwondered why there was then and continuing to now no coverage by the major media.\u201d I never received a response. Just as the Hammond piece broke the web of silence around the downing of the Iranian airliner, the regional Cape Cod Times newspaper fearlessly published my letter quoted above. A few days later the CCT included my second letter inviting readers who still regard the attack as an innocent mistake to view the online videos and survivor interviews. However, the purpose of this article is not to recount details of the attack or the differing interpretations it has generated. Interested readers can find examples of both in the more than a dozen books on the subject available on Amazon and in survivor-narrated videos available on the Internet. Rather, our purpose is to ask why the mainstream media continues to participate in a continuing official cover-up. While the New York Times and other American newspapers slept through the Liberty\u2019s 50th anniversary and survivor events, the Israeli journal Haaretz on July11 cited a CIA document, still partly censored, that relates a conversation between an Israeli pilot and the Israeli Defense Force war room prior to the attack. The material language appears in article\u2019s title: \u201c\u2018 But Sir, It\u2019s an American Ship.\u2019 Never Mind, Hit Her! When Israel Attacked USS Liberty.\u201d That Haaretz published this story a week ago shows that the topic remains current fifty years on. The above cited FPJ article observes that \u201cthe lack of mention of the [Iranian shootdown] \u2026illustrates an institutionalized bias in the media.\u201d By failing to report on the Liberty affair and subsequent investigations, the New York Times and other mainstream journals have committed a similar sin of omission.","label":1}
{"text":"Five Years After Losing Son, Radio Host Delilah Shattered Again after Losing Another Child: Anyone who listens to syndicated radio is probably familiar with at least the voice of Delilah. With an estimated 8 million listeners, this long-time radio host gives encouragement to listeners who call her with their requests. Delilah tells people, \u201cI love sharing my life with you as much as I love hearing about yours.\u201d Many times she will listen to someone\u2019s story and then choose the song she feels best speaks to their situation. What we all too often fail to realize though, is Delilah, and others who publically help people with their problems such as Dr. Phil, have lives of their own. They face the same day-to-day realities the rest of us do.  Delilah is the mother of 13 children. Her huge brood of kids is relatively unknown to her fans. TRENDING: Broke Mom on Last $20, Kids Pray to God for Miracle. Then Finds Envelope with Check on Doorstep Now, instead of Delilah soothing the emotions of a distraught caller, she is in need of the same type of comfort she regularly doles out. Life has dealt her a bad hand. One of her children, Zachariah, recently died by suicide. \u201cHe was being treated, counseled, and embraced fiercely by family and friends while battling depression for some time now,\u201d she said of her now-deceased child.  My dear friends, I need to share some devastating news with you. In the early morning hours, Tuesday, October 3, my son, Zachariah, took his life. There are over 1 million recorded suicides per year, but when they hit as close to home as Delilah\u2019s son, just one of them is enough to destroy the emotional well-being of the people left behind to mourn their loss. Questions go unanswered, and though often unwarranted, feelings of guilt relentlessly invade their psyche. Delilah said her heart is broken beyond repair and she cannot fathom how to go on. She also believes her son is at peace and is resting with the Lord. Ten of Delilah\u2019s 13 children are adopted. She lost another child, Sammy, in 2012 from sickle cell anemia.  If you are a fan of Delilah\u2019s and have called her show concerning whatever was on your mind at the time, please remember there are sometimes people who are going through worse things than you are. This is a classic example. Delilah will be taking an \u201cindefinite break from radio.\u201d She will also be absent \u201con social media for a time as [she grieves and tries] to process this loss with [her] family.\u201d Just as many people are experiencing, or have experienced, an insurmountable tragedy in their life, being famous does not exempt radio, television, or movie personalities from what life is going to do. Good, or bad. However, the strength Delilah is showing in the face of despair should be an example for all of us to follow. While this is one of the most difficult challenges she has ever had to face, life for Delilah goes on. We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.

And the way Matthews sees it, Trump\u2019s hatred for Barack Obama runs deep \u2014 and is ethnically based. With the panel talking about the whole Rex Tillerson-Trump drama, Matthews jumped in to claim that one of the reasons Trump is undercutting his staff on foreign policy is because he wants to wipe out Obama\u2019s successes. \u201cLet me go back to my wheelhouse, that is this president\u2019s ethnic look at history,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cThis president doesn\u2019t want to admit that his predecessor was Barack Obama. He wants to erase his face, his name, his origin, everything from the history books.\u201d After stating that Trump is trying to get rid of the Iran nuclear deal and Obamacare because they were signature achievements of the Obama era, He then asked why Trump would want a two-front war with Iran and North Korea \u201cexcept out of some weird bitterness toward the success of Barack Obama.\u201d MSNBC host Joy Reid went on to state that Trump\u2019s has an \u201cobsession with outdoing and surpassing\u201d Obama and because he\u2019s angry, \u201che\u2019s crashing through the world\u201d undoing everything Obama accomplished.

{"text":"Jim Acosta To WH: Does Trump Value the First Amendment As Much as the Second Amendment?: President Donald Trump raised a lot of eyebrows with an early morning tweet suggesting that the Senate Intelligence Committee should investigate media outlets he deems to be \u201cFake News!\u201d  Why Isn\u2019t the Senate Intel Committee looking into the Fake News Networks in OUR country to see why so much of our news is just made up-FAKE! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2017  Though it may have been just a rhetorical aside, many saw this as a chilling threat to the first amendment rights that ensures every citizen free speech (and more to the point, free press.) The fact that the President would even suggest that the U.S. government should go after media outlets that he feels \u2014 rather subjectively \u2014 are spreading what he deems to be \u201cfake news\u201d is a very dangerous precedent. As we\u2019ve written before, negative coverage, or even misreporting, really don\u2019t rise to the what the understanding of what we\u2019ve long considered to be propaganda (or \u201c\u201dfake news.\u201d) Though President Trump has had some success in redefining the term. Enter CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta into the White House Press Briefing today, who has held something of an inimical role to the White House communications department. Given that the Second Amendment is in the ether after Sunday night\u2019s deadly Las Vegas shooting, Acosta challenged Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Trump\u2019s tweet. Acosta opened by noting the news outlined above, stating \u201cthe president tweets this morning he\u2019d like to see the Senate intelligence committee investigate news outlets and I guess this quest to go after fake news.\u201d He then asked \u201cDoes he value the First Amendment as much as he values the Second Amendment?\u201d Huckabee Sanders, to her credit, did not demur in her reply, saying \u201cAbsolutely. The president is an incredible advocate of the First Amendment.\u201d She then pivoted to pointing out the vast amount of negative coverage that this White House has endured, saying:  We\u2019ve seen recent information that says only 5% of media coverage has been positive about this president and this administration while at the same time you have the stock market and economic confidence at an all-time high, ISIS is on the run, unemployment at the lowest it\u2019s been in 17 years, weave cut regulations at historic pace, fixing the VA. With you\u2019ve only found 5% of your time to focus on those big issues. No a lot of the things you cover, not a lot of the petty palace intrigue that you spend your time on, I think we need to move towards a certainly more fair, more accurate and frankly a more responsible news media for the American people.  Sanders is citing reports of negative coverage for Trump as evidence of bias. But that ignores many variables, namely the shaky first nine months that the Trump administration has endured and the departure of many senior officials (Michael Flynn, Mike Dubke, Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, Anthony Scaramucci, etc) as well as numerous investigations, an FBI Director firing and inflammatory comments made after a deadly protest of racists and white nationalists. Again, a lack of positive coverage does not prove bias, especially for an administration that has so uniquely struggled. Acosta tried to go back for another follow up, but was predictably shut down by Ms. Sanders.

{"text":"Sen. Chris Murphy Blasts Health Care Executive Order: Trump \u2018Put a Gun to the Head of Our Constituents\u2019:  . @ChrisMurphyCT: @POTUS\u2018 plan to end ObamaCare subsidies \u2018health care arson\u2019 https:\/\/t.co\/V4mDubxcEh pic.twitter.com\/pSpkSgX9sZ \u2014 Fox News (@FoxNews) October 15, 2017  Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, created a vivid, cutthroat description of President Donald Trump\u2019s new health care executive order \u2014 likening the policy to shoving a firearm in the face of American voters. The new policy, which kills federal payouts to insurers, was dubbed by Murphy as \u201chealth care arson\u201d during an appearance on Fox News Sunday today. The junior Democrat senator serves on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and has been one of the loudest voices in advocating against the GOP\u2019s attempts at Obamacare repeal. Murhpy\u2019s full comment went as follows:  \u201c[Trump] is literally setting the entire health care system on fire \u2014 just because the president is upset that the United States Congress won\u2019t pass a repeal bill that is supported by 17 percent of the American public\u2026 The fact of the matter is the president is trying to sabotage the american health care system, trying to has put a gun to the head of our constituents by taking away their health care or raising their costs in order to force us to repeal a bill that the American public doesn\u2019t want us to repeal.\u201d  The \u201csabotage\u201d that Murphy mentioned is a reference to Trump cutting an Obamacare subsidy program that aimed to cut out-of-pocket charges for low-income and working class Americans. With help and advice from Senator Rand Paul, Trump made the decision to cut these subsidy payments in an attempt to allow small businesses access to the same kind of coverage as large group plans. However, critics \u2014 like Murphy \u2014 argue that Trump\u2019s executive order will actually hurt the Americans that it\u2019s designed to help, specificallyones with pre-existing conditions.

{"text":"The Destruction of The United States of America Is Almost Complete!: Ladies and gentlemen, hold your families close, because if we even make it to Christmas, it\u2019s bound to be our last. The Republican Party is systematically tearing down the country brick by brick and this week could finally be the one that breaks the country completely. It is bad enough that the Republicans tried to take away healthcare from millions of people by not forcing them to buy it. Thank God they failed there, but they apparently didn\u2019t think that was enough. They took away net neutrality, which was enforced to solve a problem that didn\u2019t exist, and decided to give it back to the free market rather than keep it under the control of the executive branch, where it could safely be in Donald Trump\u2019s capable, though very tiny hands. That should have been enough, but they were out for more blood. Despite the fact that the Republicans were warned that ending net neutrality would kill millions, enslave the LGBT community, and do untold damage to the remaining minority communities, they ended it and they still sought more. This brings us to the tax reform package. It looks like there will be a vote on Tuesday to get the conference committee\u2019s bill through the legislative branch and quickly bring it to Trump\u2019s desk. This bill, if passed, is set to do incredible damage to the American way of life. For starters, thanks to heartless robot Marco Rubio, people will be able to receive bigger tax credits for having more kids. Do you know what that means? It\u2019s a bigger incentive to have more children. In a world that Republicans are apparently trying to destroy, it is morally reprehensible to willingly bring children into it just to save a bit on your tax note. What\u2019s worse, however, is that there are cuts to business tax bills, meaning that some major companies could move back to American soil, and bring their big corporate dollars with them. More business here means more opportunities for major corporations to pollute our earth and create jobs for Americans. That means more people going to work, and their cars will only exacerbate the pollution problem. On top of all that, this bill repeals the individual mandate, so millions of people will die by not being forced to buy insurance, just like the GOP really intended all along. The Republicans have to be stopped. I think. Because according to Twitter, all of this stuff is not cool, and the Republicans are monsters.","label":1}
{"text":"Steve Bannon\u2019s Tactical Retreat: \u201cSoon\u2026\u201d Once a man on top of the world, Steve Bannon is now fighting for his life. He was President Donald Trump\u2019s closest advisor, as well as the driving force behind the biggest and most pro-Trump outlet that isn\u2019t Fox News. He was also a self-styled kingmaker, looking to push candidates who would fulfill the same agenda Trump\u2019s presidency was supposed to aim for. However, Bannon lost the job of advisor. His outlet\u2019s influence does not appear to be reaching as far as it used to. His candidates fail. It\u2019s difficult to tell who fell out of love with who first, but Bannon and the White House do not appear to be in love anymore. I won\u2019t re-hash all of the details, but the latest drama seems to stem from writer Michael Wolff\u2019s unfettered access to the White House and its staff as he wrote a book on the tumultuous presidency. Some of the key quotes from the book indicate that Trump was aware of the Russian meetings. Others show Bannon insulting Ivanka\u2019s intelligence. If Bannon was hoping to lay low after the complete debacle that was the Roy Moore candidacy, it looks like he\u2019s out of luck. This story is going to get a lot of airtime, and why wouldn\u2019t it? Trump\u2019s closest advisor from the early days basically admitted there was something to this Russia story that keeps plaguing the administration. What will stop any media outlet from talking about that, as well as having panels talking about that. Bannon is not a complete dummy. His actions from the moment of Andrew Breitbart\u2019s death were calculated to make Bannon into a political playmaker \u2013 someone who could change the face of Washington. It wasn\u2019t an ideological urge, either. Every action he\u2019s taken indicates he just wants to be remembered as the guy who orchestrated the cleaning of the swamp. It\u2019s all blowing up in his face, however, so he\u2019s having to sound a tactical retreat. The statements against the Trump family are designed to help him wash his hands of the Trump Administration should there be something to these Russia allegations. Looking at his website, it appears he is easing off that plan, and will instead focus on the good of the Trump Administration. Because, even if you were fired from the White House, you still want your contacts and pushers in D.C. helping you out. However, he is not fighting from a position of strength anymore. Bannon has been forced to go defensive now, and you can tell from the editorial direction at his site currently that they don\u2019t want to fight Trump right now. There is a simple reason for that, too: They built this monster, and they know the monster will turn and consume them if they don\u2019t watch out. If you\u2019re looking for the good news, however, please note that Trump and Bannon taking swings at each other was a fantastic last-minute Christmas gift.","label":1}
{"text":"Andrew McCabe\u2019s Retirement Is a Chance for the FBI to Regain Its Reputation and Integrity: Photographic evidence of Andrew McCabe engaging in an in-your-face violation of the Hatch Act. Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe will take early retirement from the FBI in March, according to a report in the Washington Post. This is long overdue. It was obvious long before Christopher Wray was confirmed that McCabe was part of the problem and not part of the solution. McCabe is currently under investigation by the Department of Justice IG for his blatant violation of the Hatch Act. When his wife was running for a state senate seat in Virginia, she received $675,000 either directly from Clinton bagman, ally, and Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe or from entities over which McAuliffe exercised total control. These two things are not illegal, though for a \u201cnon-political\u201d law enforcement official to be in this position skirts the edge of the \u201cappearance of misconduct rule.\u201d I posted a detailed account of McCabe\u2019s Hatch Act violations\u2013they aren\u2019t \u201cgray area\u201d violations, they are blatant \u201cthe law doesn\u2019t apply to me\u201d violations\u2013back in June. In short, he used his official FBI biography as part of her effort to be selected as the preferred Democrat candidate, he appeared in her campaign literature wearing her campaign gear, he posted images of him holding supportive messages, and he used his official FBI email to promote his wife\u2019s candidacy. According to FBI documents, McCabe was in charge of the Hillary Clinton email investigation from February 2016 until he recused himself on November 1, 2016. And, of course, as deputy director, McCabe was up to his eyebrows in the Trump dossier. As the guy running the day-to-day business of the FBI, it is impossible that the proposal to pay retired British spy Christopher Steele some $50,000 to continue his investigation escaped his notice. Since the firing of Peter Strzok, we\u2019ve learned that McCabe and Strzok, on at least one occasion, spoke at some length about the presidential race, and, given the tenor of the text messages, we can presume they all talked about the necessity of Hillary Clinton winning. What makes this conversation so damning is that McCabe cleared Strzok to work on Mueller\u2019s Russia probe. As I noted earlier today, the FBI\u2019s general counsel met with a reporter who was actively promoting the Trump dossier. While there was no fire, per se, there was enough smoke and stench that it was clear that McCabe was not going to survive in the long run. McCabe\u2019s actions, and those of a lot of other senior FBI staff, left the casual observer the option of believing he was stupid or that he just didn\u2019t care about rules and thought he was bulletproof\u2026or that the Deep State is real and had been accidentally revealed. Before his testimony this past Tuesday, Trey Gowdy had this to say: GOWDY: I\u2019m still trying to figure out why three FBI agents are discussing politics in the deputy director\u2019s office. Because you\u2019re not supposed to discuss politics on federal ground and FBI agents aren\u2019t supposed to engage in politics for Hatch Act reasons. Remember, we were supposed to interview Andy McCabe yesterday on another committee. It was all set up and ready to go, then, at the last minute, they said he can\u2019t come Tuesday, he\u2019s going to come next week. I\u2019ll be shocked if he comes next week. I\u2019ll be a little bit surprised if he\u2019s still an employee of the FBI this time next week. According to the Washington Post, McCabe will retire in March:  Andrew McCabe, the FBI\u2019s deputy director who has been the target of Republican critics for more than a year, plans to retire in a few months when he becomes fully eligible for pension benefits, according to people familiar with the matter.  McCabe turns 50 on May 5 and this, under the peculiarities of the federal retirement system for FBI agents, allows him to retire at full benefits (1.7% of the average of his high-three pay years, times 20). I\u2019m assuming in March that he\u2019ll sign out on leave and not come back. Of course, the anti-Trumpers who were crying in their beer over James Baker\u2019s demotion are putting a brave face on it  A word of caution on the Andrew McCabe story. I have always assumed that McCabe would retire in March to let Wray build his own team. So I would not see this as part of any purge. The question about McCabe was always whether he would be forced out early. \u2014 Benjamin Wittes (@benjaminwittes) December 23, 2017  McCabe\u2019s ouster is a very good thing. The FBI had become highly politicized under Comey. Political loyalties drove major investigations, not the law or the evidence. Wray inherited an executive staff that was not only loyal to Comey but was hostile to the current administration. Pushing the general counsel aside and forcing the retirement of McCabe is a great chance for Wray to build his own team. A professional and non-partisan team. For a change.","label":0}

{"text":"The Boy Named Jihad: From the Ashes of the Arab Spring to the Battlefields of Syria: AMMAN, Jordan\u2014Umm Jihad\u2019s desktop background is a photo of her son Jihad smiling over his shoulder in a forest, superimposed on a sparkly pastel backdrop. \u201cThis was in Syria right before he died,\u201d the 44-year-old mother said (she asked to be referred to as Umm Jihad, or \u201cMother of Jihad,\u201d rather than by her formal name). Umm Jihad clicked on a folder labeled \u201cJojo\u201d to show more pictures: Jihad leading a protest for government reform at Amman\u2019s al-Dakhiliya circle; Jihad giving a speech at the University of Jordan; Jihad dressed in white for a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia; Jihad taking a selfie with his younger brother; Jihad with a full beard, holding a gun, wading through a stream, and waving a black flag inscribed with Jabhat al-Nusra\u2019s white letters: \u201cThere is no God but God. Muhammad is the prophet of God.\u201d The last file in her folder is an amateur diptych, two photos of Jihad in the same pose: sprawled on the floor, chest forward, arms outstretched. On the right, he\u2019s asleep at home on a pile of books and papers, exhausted from studying for tawjihi, the Jordanian college-entrance exam. On the left, blood is pooling from the bullet holes in his bare back. He\u2019s 20 years old, a foreign fighter in Syria, dead. Jihad Ghaban was one of at least 2,000 Jordanians who have joined factions in the Syrian civil war since it began in 2011, according to analysts\u2019 estimates. As the war enters its fifth year, neighboring Jordan finds itself caught up in the conflict\u2014hosting more than a million refugees from Syria and Iraq while participating in the U.S.-led military coalition against ISIS. Jordan is now the only Arab country left in that coalition. Still, Jordan\u2019s more acute fight is internal. Its stability is evidence of its strong security, as tightened borders and surveillance prevent Jordanians from joining or forming domestic cells of groups like the Islamic State. And ISIS\u2019s filmed killing of the captured Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh, broadcast in February, helped shift Jordanian public opinion against the Islamic extremist group. But Jordanian opposition to ISIS doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate a broader rejection of militant jihad. Instead, many Jordanians are engaged in a debate about the boundaries and legitimacy of violent extremism. Umm Jihad\u2019s son left Jordan to fight back in 2013, before the rise of ISIS and subsequent strife between militant jihadist groups in Syria. But the lack of democratic reform after the Arab Spring, along with the spread of religious extremism amid regional instability, continue to undermine many Jordanians\u2019 belief in the country\u2019s political leaders and religious institutions. Interpretation of Islam, and particularly the concept of jihad, is in flux, leaving an exegetical gray zone for passionate, disempowered youth like Jihad Ghaban. Mo\u2019men Jaabo was 23 when he first met Jihad as a 16-year-old in 2011, the first year of the Arab Spring. Jaabo, who was a schoolteacher at the time, marched next to Jihad through downtown Amman, shouting slogans about freedom and political reform. They used to protest at al-Dakhiliya circle in the daytime, then spend nights writing graffiti in the East Amman neighborhood of Hay Nazzal, where Jihad lived. The neighborhood is poor, conservative, and mostly Palestinian, with a growing Syrian population including older people who fled the Assad government\u2019s Hama massacre in the 1980s and new refugees from the latest conflict. Jaabo showed me a wall bearing Jihad\u2019s handwriting, partially covered over with red paint but still visible: \u201cWhy does the king live in a castle while the people die of poverty?\u201d A few streets away, Jaabo pointed out a large mosque overlooking Hay Nazzal\u2019s main traffic circle. \u201cThat\u2019s where Jihad prayed,\u201d Jaabo said, adding that the mosque was well known for Salafi preaching that called for a fundamentalist return to Islam as practiced by the first generations of Muslims. Preachers there interpreted jihad as literal warfare in defense of the Muslim community. Jihad was an early participant in Herak, Jordan\u2019s largest youth-activist movement. During the Arab Spring, its members protested weekly for democratic change, constitutional reform, and action against corruption. \u201cAll the young guys, we were full of hope that we would make lots of changes,\u201d Jaabo said. \u201cWe saw the Egyptian revolution, Syria, Tunisia\u2014the governments were scared. We were the strong side.\u201d Jihad Ghaban (far right) in 2012 (Mo\u2019men Jaabo) Four years later, the Jordanian government\u2019s promised reform initiatives have largely fallen short of the activists\u2019 demands. Freedoms of expression and assembly are more limited than before the region\u2019s uprisings, especially with expanded anti-terrorism laws that authorities can use to arrest and try dissidents in military court. Herak still exists, but as the Arab Spring gave way to chaos across the region, many of its most ardent followers became disillusioned, Jihad included. \u201cWhen things went down after the first year in Syria, then Libya, we lost hope. It felt like our effort was nonsense,\u201d Jaabo said. \u201cIn Jordan, we felt everyone was laughing at the youth. The government and parties were all laughing. Nobody was serious about making reform.\u201d Jaabo is now 26 and works as the manager of a falafel restaurant. Other Herak members, many from more privileged backgrounds in West Amman, left to study abroad or work in Gulf countries, he said. But Jihad was still a teenager, the son of a factory worker, and struggling to afford his first year of college tuition. Aside from studying, Jihad worked in Jordan\u2019s Sharawi chewing-gum factory. He\u2019d get off work and cross Amman on foot to attend Herak protests, walking for hours because he couldn\u2019t afford taxi fares. His friends nicknamed him Abu Sharawi for the gum he\u2019d pass around every time he arrived. When Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime cracked down on Syrian protesters, Umm Jihad said, Jihad spent hours watching Al Jazeera and crying. In the middle of winter, Jaabo said, he and Jihad walked to the Syrian embassy to protest in the snow, waving Free Syria flags to demonstrate Jordanian solidarity against Assad. As the situation in Syria worsened and Jordan\u2019s activists lost traction, Jihad started thinking about joining the fight. He\u2019d ask his friends what they thought was the best way to help Syrians, said Jihad\u2019s 22-year-old friend Laith Alawneh. \u201cHe started thinking that our fight in Jordan is not the priority,\u201d Alawneh said. \u201cThere is no bloodshed here, but people in Syria were being killed.\u201d In June 2013, Jihad went on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia with a group of young people from his local mosque. When he came back, Umm Jihad said, Jihad told her he wanted to spend a few days in Cairo with friends before returning to school. Jihad flew from Jordan to Egypt to Turkey. After a few days, he called his mother from the Syrian city of Aleppo and told her he\u2019d joined Jabhat al-Nusra. At the time, ISIS was a fairly low-profile group operating as al-Qaeda in Iraq. In Syria, it had recently announced a short-lived merger with Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Qaeda\u2019s Syrian branch and one of the most prominent rebel groups fighting the Assad regime. Nusra enjoyed considerable popular support. But it had also been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. government. During his first year in Syria, Jihad worked for Jabhat al-Nusra\u2019s media office. He had once dreamed of being a journalist; he\u2019d interned at a community radio station in Jordan and filmed youth protests during the Arab Spring. Now he filmed Nusra fighters, spread the footage on social media, and peppered Facebook with increasingly extremist posts. \u201cJihad changed then,\u201d Jaabo said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the things he started to say.\u201d In Jordan, Jihad had had friends of all stripes: Muslim Brotherhood supporters, communists, even conservatives who weren\u2019t politically active. He\u2019d swung across the political spectrum, considering joining the Brotherhood, then the leftist parties, but rejecting them all in the end. \u201cThe parties can\u2019t criticize the [Jordanian] king because they are part of the system. Jihad wasn\u2019t satisfied with this,\u201d Jaabo said. \u201cHe\u2019d rather be independent than compromise.\u201d Jihad was religious before going to Syria, his friends and family said, but not radical. \u201cHe loved Islam,\u201d said Alawneh, Jihad\u2019s leftist friend. \u201cBut he was also talking to girls and going out. He wasn\u2019t strict at all.\u201d Jihad Ghaban and his brother at home (Umm Jihad) After Jihad went to Syria, he changed his Facebook profile photo from the Free Syria flag to the Jabhat al-Nusra flag. His purist tendencies took a religious bent, manifesting in his Facebook declarations that communists were kuffar, or infidels, and had to be killed. Did that mean, Jihad\u2019s friends in Jordan wondered, that he would fight them if they were in Syria? Jihad was getting caught in an ideological and religious war, his friends told him, not a freedom fight. \u201cStill he didn\u2019t change his mind,\u201d Jaabo said. \u201cHe\u2019d tell us, \u2018You\u2019re not helping people. You\u2019re in the house while people are suffering,\u2019\u201d said Jihad\u2019s Syrian childhood friend Mulham al-Ahdab. He thought Jihad was being abrasive on Facebook, but then again, Syria was burning. At least Jihad was doing something. \u201cI hate this world that stays silent while young guys like Jihad sacrifice themselves,\u201d Ahdab said. \u201cWe all still loved him.\u201d Eventually, Jihad took up arms for Nusra. In October 2014, one year and four months after entering Syria, he was shot by Syrian government forces and killed. From the Jordanian government\u2019s perspective, combating extremism requires a combination of security policy\u2014guarding the country\u2019s borders to prevent fighters from flowing in or out of the Kingdom\u2014and ideological persuasion. \u201cOur strategy is to secure people\u2019s way of thinking,\u201d said the Ministry of the Interior spokesperson Ziad al-Zoubi. \u201cWe must support moderate ideologies before extremist ones become popular.\u201d Jordanian authorities attempt to do so by holding dialogues and workshops with youth via civil-society organizations, Zoubi said, and by promoting moderate Islam through the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs, the government entity that manages Islamic property. Ashraf al-Kilani, the director of the Jordanian civil-society organization Friends of National Security, said his organization recruits religious leaders, often from the state institution Dar al-Ifta, to engage young people in dissecting ISIS material and to point out why the group\u2019s interpretation of Islam is wrong. Sometimes participants are then brought to the King Abdullah Special Operations Training Center (KASOTC), a military training ground in the desert outside Amman, where they meet with officials from the public-security directorate. \u201cThe youth are happy to have real talk with us and to meet with security officials,\u201d Kilani said, adding that many request photos with the KASOTC officers. \u201cWe as Jordanians really adore the army, the security forces, and the king.\u201d \u201cOur strategy is to secure people\u2019s way of thinking,\u201d a government spokesperson said. \u201cWe must support moderate ideologies.\u201d On the religious side, Minister of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs Hayel Daoud said that there are 6,300 mosques in Jordan delivering some 5,000 Friday sermons every week. The country\u2019s mosques are all overseen by the government, Daoud added, so every message preached on Fridays should adhere to an Awqaf-approved version of moderate Islam. \u201cWe want them to talk about mutual topics that everyone agrees on, not anything that causes division,\u201d Daoud said. \u201cWe want topics that encourage people to live in unity and peace.\u201d Fifty ministry employees monitor the mosques and report any preachers who stray from approved content. Since the Muath al-Kaseasbeh video in February, Daoud said, the ministry has relieved 50 preachers of their duties. But critics say the Jordanian government\u2019s attempts to control the religious sphere have had a limited impact, if any at all. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone who changed his mind from extremist ideas because of someone from the Awqaf,\u201d said the Amman-based Islamist expert Hassan Abu Hanieh. Official religious institutions lack credibility among the people, he said, because they\u2019re seen as part of the political system. At the University of Jordan, Alawneh laughed at the idea that government monitoring could stop extremist ideas. \u201cAwqaf stopped 50 people who support extremist ideas in the whole country?\u201d he said. \u201cGo walk on our campus for 10 minutes and I\u2019ll find you 50 more.\u201d Jihad Ghaban as a freshman at the University of Jordan (Umm Jihad) Fewer Jordanian youth are going to fight in Syria now than when Jihad went, Alawneh observed, but that\u2019s not necessarily because the government has changed young people\u2019s minds about the merits of jihad. The interpretation of jihad, a duty to literally \u201cstruggle\u201d for Islam, is disputed. Some Muslims understand the struggle as spiritual and internal; others speak in terms of social justice, of educational, missionary, intellectual, or economic endeavor; and still others of holy warfare. \u201cWhen Jihad died, all these Salafi guys were making speeches at his wake, saying how he was brave and martyred,\u201d Jaabo said. \u201cNowadays the situation is very different with Daesh [an Arabic term for ISIS], but even so, people believe in the war in Syria. There\u2019s no problem [with most Jordanians] if anyone goes to fight.\u201d A university memorial service for Jihad was filled with youth who supported Jihad\u2019s decision to go to Syria, according to Alawneh. \u201cThey were all praying for God to take revenge on the Shi\u2019a and help the mujahideen,\u201d Alawneh said, referring to Sunni rebel groups fighting the Shiite Assad regime. The reasons young people aren\u2019t crossing the border to fight these days are often not ideological but practical: tightened security, no way of returning to Jordan, and reservations about the chaos and uncertainty in Syria. \u201cThere is an extremely thin line between being a very good Muslim who follows the prophet\u2019s rules and becoming extremist.\u201d \u201cJihad was brave. We are weak,\u201d said Ahdab, explaining why he didn\u2019t go to Syria as well. \u201cWe are creating different excuses for ourselves, but in the end we know that he is a hero and that he did the right thing.\u201d Alawneh, for his part, believes waging war in Syria isn\u2019t the best way to help the Syrian people. \u201cSyria is a game. You have the Saudis, Turkey, Iran, America, Qatar\u2014why would I let myself be an instrument in the hands of these people?\u201d he said. Young fighters on every side are being manipulated in a cycle of weapons, blood, and money that only advances the political interests of the big powers, Alawneh added. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t join the Jordanian army and become a tool for America either.\u201d Nasser Abu Abdulrahman, a 48-year-old Salafi sheikh from the conservative Jordanian town of Rusaifeh, said he wouldn\u2019t encourage the younger generation to fight in Syria\u2014not because doing so conflicted with his interpretation of jihad in Islam, but because of the split between jihadist groups there. \u201cThis is a time of fitnah [infighting and division among Muslims]. The mujahideen are split,\u201d Abu Abdulrahman said, referring to the schism between ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra that first developed in the summer of 2013. It\u2019s better for Jordanians to stay home for now, Abu Abdulrahman said, rather than exacerbate internal Islamic disunity by joining factions that are battling one another. Abu Abdulrahman characterized ISIS as an overly zealous group that had made serious mistakes in ideology and action, particularly in burning to death Muath al-Kaseasbeh. \u201cBut no one says that Daesh is not Muslim. We don\u2019t call them infidels,\u201d he said. Even if the Islamic State employs illegitimate methods of Quranic exegesis, he added, people will support the Sunni group out of desperation amid war, oppression, and suffering. \u201cIf a drunk man protects your son from being raped, you will defend [the drunk man]. He is better than others because he protected your son,\u201d Abu Abdulrahman explained. Likewise, people suffering in Syria and Iraq, especially Sunnis, will overlook ISIS\u2019s theological illegitimacy to support its military success, especially given the seeming lack of international will to end Syria\u2019s war. Jihad Ghaban (left) and Mo\u2019men Jaabo protest against the Syrian regime at the Syrian embassy in Amman. (Mo\u2019men Jaabo) According to his friends, Jihad was driven to join Nusra for many of those same reasons: intolerance of injustice, frustration with international inaction, and a determination to make a difference. \u201cJihad was the Arab Spring personified. He wasn\u2019t a spectator,\u201d said Ahdab. \u201cJihad was like a white page that anyone could write on. It was easy to affect him because he was so passionate,\u201d Alawneh noted. He had argued with Jihad about the legitimacy of extremist religious ideology. But bring up the chemical-weapons attacks, dying children, and raped women in Syria, and Jihad would cry. \u201cJihad had fire in his chest,\u201d Umm Jihad said. She recalled the time she and Jihad passed a man beating his donkey on the street. Her son stopped and rebuked the man even though Umm Jihad insisted it was none of their business. \u201cIf that\u2019s how he cared about donkeys, what about Syria?\u201d she mused. \u201cJihad was tired from Jordan and the government. He was always talking and no one listened to him. He wanted action, not words.\u201d Jihad went to Syria to die, Umm Jihad said, and she had no choice but to accept it. On the streets of Amman, bold signs in patriotic red, green, and black declare, \u201cRaise your head, you are Jordanian.\u201d The state\u2019s message is clear: Jordan is one; Jordan is strong; Jordan is proud to stand against the terrorists. The death of the pilot Muath al-Kaseasbeh has made this government message more of a reality, according to a recent survey by the Center for Strategic Studies (CSS) at the University of Jordan. In December 2014, 72 percent of respondents considered ISIS a terrorist group; in February 2015, after video of the Islamic State burning the pilot came out, that number went up to 95 percent. Meanwhile, 37 percent of respondents considered Jabhat al-Nusra a terrorist organization in December 2014 compared with 55 percent in February 2015 and 62 percent in April 2015. \u201cKaseasbeh changed one-fifth of the population\u2019s opinion in two weeks,\u201d said Walid al-Khatib, CSS\u2019s head of public-opinion polls and surveys. \u201cThat\u2019s more than what the government did after campaigning against ISIS for four months.\u201d Still, the best way to describe how many Jordanians view Islamic extremist groups is in shades of gray, according to Khatib. \u201cThere is an extremely thin line between being a very good Muslim who follows the prophet\u2019s rules and becoming extremist,\u201d he explained. The government may try to convince people that it knows where these lines are, but state-affiliated voices lack legitimacy on the Jordanian street. \u201cThe government places its personal interests above religious correctness,\u201d Abu Abdulrahman said. While Jordanians often trust and depend on the government to preserve national security, they are not so quick to believe its opinions on God\u2019s will. Umm Jihad, for example, doesn\u2019t have faith in official talk about nonviolent jihad. \u201cLook at how barrel bombs are destroying hospitals in Syria. Look at how Muslims are being killed in Burma. Isn\u2019t this injustice?\u201d she asked. \u201cOur religion is clear. If a Muslim needs help, you must go and fight for them.\u201d At the same time, Umm Jihad hadn\u2019t known Jihad was going to Syria, nor was she able to make him come back. \u201cI want to tell you I believe he made the right decision,\u201d she said. She\u2019d cried and begged her son to return every time he called, despite believing that jihad is a duty and that her son\u2019s motives were pure. \u201cThose without much faith will say, \u2018Stay here with me and don\u2019t go.\u2019 She with strong faith will tell her son, \u2018You must go and fight,\u2019\u201d Umm Jihad said. \u201cBut as a mother, this is difficult. This is right, but difficult.\u201d Graffiti scrawled by Jihad Ghaban in his neighborhood reads, \u201cWhy does the king live in a castle while the people die of poverty?\u201d (Alice Su) The real conversations in Jordan on religion and the nature of jihad are happening not at state-sponsored dialogue sessions, but on the Internet and social media, according to Abu Hanieh, the expert on Islamism. He opened Facebook as an example, scrolling down his news feed through an endless stream of posts: a video message from extremists establishing the \u201cstate of Sinai,\u201d a photo of the Islamic State creating roads in the Sinjar Mountains in Iraqi Kurdistan, congratulations for the ISIS victory in the Iraqi city of Ramadi, condemnation of Muslims being burned in Burma, and so on. \u201cIf the state wanted to silence the jihadis, they\u2019d have to silence everyone,\u201d Abu Hanieh said. Abu Hanieh noted that after the release of the Kaseasbeh video, he didn\u2019t see many Jordanians rejecting extremist groups outright; instead, he witnessed Jordanians discussing nuanced questions about the permissibility of burning as a punishment in Islam. \u201cThe ideology of extremism has become more flexible,\u201d Abu Hanieh said. \u201cPeople are thinking about jihad more than before, and the discussions are loud, passionate, and spreading.\u201d If the Jordanian government can\u2019t fight extremism through ideological control, what can it do? The opposite, Abu Hanieh suggested: democratic reform and political opening. \u201cJordan is moving away from democracy in the name of combating extremism,\u201d he said, citing state crackdowns on communists, Herak, and the Jordanian wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. \u201cIf you let the moderates back into the light, that will push the extremists to the margin.\u201d Jihad\u2019s friends agreed. \u201cWe need bread, freedom, and social justice,\u201d Alawneh said. As a 16-year-old, Jihad had once demanded those exact things. \u201cJihad cared so much, but he felt like nobody was listening in Jordan,\u201d Jaabo said. \u201cIf he had found real reform here, I think he never would have gone.\u201d Reporting for this article was supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.","label":1}
{"text":"The Glaring Hypocrisy of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck\u2019s Harvey Weinstein Statements: Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast In a damning New Yorker report published Tuesday, three women alleged that Harvey Weinstein raped them, and four more women cited unwanted touching from the recently ousted superproducer. But as the list of women accusing Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault lengthens, only a handful of powerful male celebrities have condemned the Hollywood heavyweight outright. Given Hollywood\u2019s propensity to forgive and forget when it comes to male abusers\u2014Woody Allen, Mel Gibson, and Roman Polanski, to name just a few\u2014this is a crucial moment in which Weinstein will either be permanently cut off from the movie business or ceremoniously vanquished only to quietly resurface in a few years. Weinstein\u2019s professional viability is directly tied to the A-List collaborators who have historically adored him. The longer celebrities remain silent on Weinstein, the more likely the story is to blow over, the disgusting allegations against the producer fading away until they\u2019re just footnotes, his alarming history of harassment transforming back into an unspoken Hollywood secret. So far, women have been more likely to condemn Weinstein than their male counterparts, with actresses like Meryl Streep, Jessica Chastain, and Julianne Moore speaking out in support of his accusers. On Tuesday even more victims went on the record with The New York Times, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie. Both alleged that Weinstein sexually harassed them near the beginning of their careers, with Paltrow recalling that, \u201cI was a kid, I was signed up, I was petrified.\u201d While actresses like Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd have become the voices of Weinstein\u2019s outing, there are a few men in the industry who have supported these women by amplifying their statements and issuing their own. George Clooney condemned Weinstein to The Daily Beast, calling his behavior \u201cindefensible.\u201d He elaborated, \u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors, and the rumors in general started back in the \u201990s, and they were that certain actresses had slept with Harvey to get a role. It seemed like a way to smear the actresses and demean them by saying that they didn\u2019t get the jobs based on their talent, so I took those rumors with a grain of salt. But the other part of this, the part we\u2019re hearing now about eight women being paid off, I didn\u2019t hear anything about that and I don\u2019t know anyone that did. That\u2019s a whole other level and there\u2019s no way you can reconcile that. There\u2019s nothing to say except that it\u2019s indefensible.\u201d Underlying every official statement and every demand for this or that A-Lister to speak out is the question of who knew what\u2014who was truly in the dark, and who was actively covering for an abuser (or simply looking the other way). As actress Emma de Caunes told The New Yorker, \u201cI know that everybody\u2014I mean everybody\u2014in Hollywood knows that it\u2019s happening\u2026 He\u2019s not even really hiding. I mean, the way he does it, so many people are involved and see what\u2019s happening. But everyone\u2019s too scared to say anything.\u201d It\u2019s entirely unfair to hound actresses for Harvey Weinstein statements or blame them for working with a man who was, by all accounts, too powerful to offend or take down. Better to focus our collective ire on powerful men who fueled the culture of silence, paving the way for Weinstein\u2019s decades of nearly unobstructed abuse. As Jessica Chastain tweeted Monday, \u201cI\u2019m sick of the media demanding only women speak up. What about the men? Perhaps many are afraid to look at their own behavior\u2026\u201d In a recent New York Times op-ed, Lena Dunham wrote that, \u201cMr. Weinstein may be the most powerful man in Hollywood to be revealed as a predator, but he\u2019s certainly not the only one who has been allowed to run wild\u2026 why the deafening silence, particularly from the industry\u2019s men, when one of our own is outed as having a nasty taste for humiliating and traumatizing women?\u201d Dunham continued, \u201cThe reason I am zeroing in on the men is that they have the least to lose and the most power to shift the narrative, and are probably not dealing with the same level of collective and personal trauma around these allegations. But here we are, days later, waiting for Mr. Weinstein\u2019s most powerful collaborators to say something. Anything.\u201d Dunham\u2019s appeal for an end to male silence was retweeted by her frequent collaborator Jenni Konner, who added, \u201cA call to arms (but also a call to Matt Damon?).\u201d Konner isn\u2019t the first person to specifically call out Damon who, alongside Ben Affleck, got his first big break courtesy of Harvey Weinstein. When Weinstein\u2019s Miramax bought the rights to 1997\u2019s Good Will Hunting, Damon and Affleck were far from household names. With the powerful producer\u2019s help, the beloved film went on to gross $138 million, taking home two Oscars and nine Academy Award nominations. A 2004 Vanity Fair article detailed Affleck and Damon\u2019s bittersweet relationship with Weinstein and Miramax. \u201cThe exchange is: They\u2019ll spend money promoting the movie, they\u2019ll spend money on an Academy campaign, they\u2019ll win you an Oscar, and their reputation is they make better movies. But they\u2019re a nightmare to make a deal with,\u201d Affleck explained, concluding, \u201cO, yeah, we kind of got screwed, but, when it came right down to it, it worked out great for us.\u201d Regarding the infamously intemperate Miramax co-chairman, Damon said this: \u201cIt\u2019s the old tale of the scorpion and the frog. The scorpion\u2019s sitting on the bank of a river, and a frog walks by, and the scorpion says, \u2018Take me to the other side.\u2019 The frog replies, \u2018No, because when we get to the other side and you have what you want, you\u2019re going to sting me.\u2019 The scorpion says, \u2018I would never do that. Please, I\u2019m asking you for a favor\u2014I can\u2019t swim. I need your help.\u2019 The frog finally agrees, takes him across on his back, and just as they get to the other side, the scorpion stings the frog. As the frog is dying, he says, \u2018Why did you do that?\u2019 The scorpion just looks down at him and says, \u2018Because I\u2019m a scorpion, it\u2019s my nature.\u2019 It\u2019s the same with Harvey. It\u2019s his nature.\u201d As revelations about Weinstein\u2019s alleged \u201cnature\u201d\u2014predatory, exploitative, vindictive, small\u2014continue to make headlines, Damon\u2019s days-long silence was seen as evidence of his continued loyalty. On Monday, Rose McGowan, who reportedly received a $100,000 settlement after a hotel-room incident with Weinstein, tweeted, \u201cHey @Mattdamon what\u2019s it like to be a spineless profiteer who stays silent?\u201d McGowan also called out his Good Will Hunting pals Ben and Casey Affleck, writing, \u201chow\u2019s your morning boys?\u201d Unlike other actors who merely worked with Weinstein, reaping in the profits and awards, Damon allegedly played a role in the culture of silence that allowed the producer to maintain his position of power. The Wrap founder Sharon Waxman says that she was working on a story for The New York Times about Weinstein\u2019s alleged misconduct back in 2004. According to Vulture, \u201cWaxman alleges in The Wrap that Matt Damon and Russell Crowe called her \u2018directly\u2019 to dispel the reports she was following about Miramax\u2019s Italian head Fabrizio Lombardo, who was allegedly hired \u2018to take care of Weinstein\u2019s women needs.\u2019 She says that because of their influence, and interference from Weinstein, whose company was a big advertiser in the Times, the article was edited to remove the more salacious details.\u201d When Damon finally did comment on the Weinstein controversy on Tuesday, it was in large part to defend himself against these accusations. The actor insisted that while he did speak to Waxman at Harvey\u2019s behest, it was only to detail his professional experience with Lombardo. \u201cHarvey had called me and said, they\u2019re writing a story about Fabrizio, who I knew from The Talented Mr. Ripley,\u201d he recalled. \u201cHe has organized our premiere in Italy and so I knew him in a professional capacity and I\u2019d had dinner at his house. Harvey said, Sharon Waxman is writing a story about Fabrizio and it\u2019s really negative. Can you just call and tell her what your experience with Fabrizio was. So I did, and that\u2019s what I said to her\u2026I\u2019m sure I mentioned to her that I didn\u2019t know anything about the rest of her piece, because I didn\u2019t. And I still don\u2019t know anything about that and Fabrizio. My experience with him was all above board and that\u2019s what I told her.\u201d \u201cFor the record, I would never, ever, ever try to kill a story like that. I just wouldn\u2019t do that. It\u2019s not something I would do, for anybody,\u201d Damon continued, adding, \u201cI did five or six movies with Harvey. I never saw this. I think a lot of actors have come out and said, everybody\u2019s saying we all knew. That\u2019s not true. This type of predation happens behind closed doors, and out of public view. If there was ever an event that I was at and Harvey was doing this kind of thing and I didn\u2019t see it, then I am so deeply sorry, because I would have stopped it.\u201d Ben Affleck also issued a statement on Tuesday, writing that, \u201cI am saddened and angry that a man who I worked with used his position of power to intimidate, sexually harass, and manipulate many women over decades\u2026 This is completely unacceptable, and I find myself asking what I can do to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen to others. We need to do better at protecting our sisters, friends, co-workers, and daughters. We must support those who come forward, condemn this type of behavior when we see it and help ensure there are more women in positions of power.\u201d (Affleck and Damon did not respond to The Daily Beast\u2019s requests for comment on this story.) Affleck\u2019s performative condemnation thoroughly backfired on social media. Just hours after the actor released his statement, a Twitter user wrote, \u201cHe also grabbed [One Tree Hill actress] Hilarie Burton\u2019s breasts on TRL once. Everyone forgot though.\u201d Burton herself quickly jumped in to confirm the incident, responding, \u201cI didn\u2019t forget.\u201d She then tweeted an outtakes clip from her TRL appearance, in which she appears to reference Affleck\u2019s groping, saying, \u201cHe comes over and tweaks my left boob.\u201d Burton recalled, \u201cI had to laugh back then so I wouldn\u2019t cry.\u201d She was 21 years old at the time. Rose McGowan also responded to Affleck on Tuesday, seemingly asserting that the actor knew more than he\u2019s letting on: \u201c\u2018GODDAMNIT! I TOLD HIM TO STOP DOING THAT\u2019 you said that to my face. The press conf I was made to go to after assault. You lie.\u201d She later added \u201cBen Affleck fuck off.\u201d McGowan and Affleck co-starred in the 1998 film Phantoms, which was released by Weinstein\u2019s Miramax one year after an alleged incident with Weinstein and McGowan at a hotel suite during the Sundance Film Festival resulted in the aforementioned financial settlement. Damon and Affleck\u2019s statements feel disingenuous, and not just because they waited days to issue them, finally speaking out when the pressure to do so (from both the public and their peers) became unbearable. Both of the actors purport to support victims and condemn abusers. Affleck\u2019s statement in particular is focused around the concept of doing more, with the star seemingly challenging himself to work toward dismantling the systems of power that elevate abusers and silence their victims. One wonders where Ben Affleck, male ally, was back in 2016, when he was a major player in his brother Casey Affleck\u2019s Oscar campaign. As Lainey Gossip\u2019s Lainey Lui pointed out at the time, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon were incredibly visible during the campaign, posing as a trio with Casey at premieres as the Best Actor race heated up. Damon, who produced Manchester by the Sea, praised its star in multiple interviews, calling Casey \u201cone of the best actors I\u2019ve ever met\u201d\u2014someone \u201cI grew up with and loved dearly.\u201d In an article for The Cut, Allie Jones proposed that it was Casey\u2019s proximity to these A-List stars that protected his career after 2010 sexual harassment allegations resurfaced. \u201cLuckiest for Affleck, he is the brother of a major movie star and the childhood friend of another,\u201d Jones wrote. \u201cThis brotherly posing makes prestige outlets hesitant to ask the younger Affleck tough questions, for fear of losing access to all three stars. His cruise to the Oscars continues undeterred because of his privileged position in Hollywood.\u201d As The Daily Beast previously reported, two women who worked with Affleck on the set of his documentary I\u2019m Still Here alleged that they were subject to a spectrum of unprofessional behavior, ranging from verbal harassment and inappropriate comments to unwanted touching and physical intimidation. The film\u2019s director of photography Magdalena Gorka described the experience as \u201cthe most traumatizing of her career.\u201d According to Gorka\u2019s complaint, she was staying with other crewmembers in New York for a shoot one night when she was woken up by Affleck\u2019s presence. She alleged that the actor was, \u201ccurled up next to her in the bed wearing only his underwear and a T-shirt. He had his arm around her, was caressing her back, his face was within inches of hers and his breath reeked of alcohol.\u201d When Gorka ordered her married boss to leave, Affleck allegedly responded, \u201cWhy?\u201d and then asked if she was \u201csure.\u201d Producer Amanda White also sued Affleck with similar claims. As The Daily Beast reported, \u201c[White] described an instance where she was prevented from returning to her bedroom during shooting, because Affleck and Phoenix had locked themselves in her room with two women where they had sex with them [Affleck was married with two children to Phoenix\u2019s sister, Summer, at the time\u2014though the couple recently split]. She also alleged that Affleck attempted to manipulate her into sharing a hotel room with him. When she resisted, White claimed, he grabbed her threateningly and attempted to scare her into submission.\u201d Both White and Gorka\u2019s lawsuits ultimately ended in settlements. After a slew of fawning profiles and rave reviews, Affleck won an Oscar for Best Actor, proving once again that allegedly abusing women does not disqualify men from the entertainment industry\u2019s highest honor. Harvey Weinstein and Casey Affleck are not the same, but they\u2019ve both benefited from the same system: one in which powerful men protect other powerful men, and reporters are pressured not to publish certain stories or ask certain questions. Casey Affleck\u2019s career flourished even after two women came forward to accuse him of sexual harassment. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon actively threw their support behind him, and it\u2019s safe to say that that A-list backing helped accelerate the collective amnesia that allowed Hollywood to forgive Casey\u2019s alleged misconduct. After Casey Affleck seemingly dismissed the claims against him, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon testified to his talent and stood beside him literally and figuratively, all but ensuring that Casey\u2019s career would continue along its upward trajectory. It seems like Ben Affleck and Matt Damon take no issue with the culture of silence when it is convenient to them, and are quick to harness their power in order to protect family and friends. But when it is no longer permissible to be associated with a known abuser, they distance themselves with vague statements, performing disgust and horror, evoking their wives and daughters. Condemning Weinstein now that he is too toxic to collaborate with does not an ally make; particularly when we\u2019re dealing with men like Damon and Affleck who have historically aided alleged abusers and worked to preserve their Teflon reputations.","label":1}
{"text":"Steve Bannon Exits Breitbart News, Will \u2018Try and Reinvent Himself\u2019: NBC Steve Bannon will be stepping down as Chairman and CEO of Breitbart News, days after he suffered a stunning backlash for his comments in Michael Wolff\u2019s \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m proud of what the Breitbart team has accomplished in so short a period of time in building out a world-class news platform,\u201d said Bannon in a terse statement first reported on Breitbart Tuesday. The former White House chief strategist blasted Donald Trump Jr\u2019s meeting with a Russian lawyer as \u201ctreasonous\u201d in the Wolff book, but later backtracked by saying he was not criticizing the president\u2019s son, and was actually criticizing the political insiders, including Paul Manafort, who allowed him to take the meeting. Steve Bannon Responds to 'Fire and Fury,' Says Support of Trump is 'Unwavering' The backtracking didn\u2019t work. Key allies have abandoned Bannon, including Breitbart backer Rebekah Mercer, whose family also supported Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. President Trump has not amended a blistering denunciation of Bannon, his former confidant and campaign manager. Despite Bannon\u2019s departure, former Breitbart spokesperson Kurt Bardella said it probably would not be the last we heard of him. He said Bannon \u2014 who Trump detractors sometimes called \u201cPresident Bannon\u201d because of his influence \u2014 has even considered his own political career. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be quiet or silent for very long. Acceptance fate or defeat is not in his DNA,\u201d Bardella told TheWrap. \u201cSomeone who entertains running for president doesn\u2019t just retreat and shrink away into anonymity. He will try and reinvent himself. He will try and finish what he started.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very surprised,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump aide who speaks with Bannon regularly. \u201cI thought everything subsided after the weekend.\u201d Former Breitbart tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos told TheWrap that people lacing into Bannon now were \u201chypocrites,\u201d and he too predicted another act. \u201cThe people knifing Steve now are cowards and hypocrites,\u201d said Yiannopoulos. \u201cThey were perfectly happy to suck up to him when he had the President\u2019s ear. Steve is one of the most brilliant political operatives of his generation. You\u2019re a fool if you think this is anything but the opening of his next chapter.\u201d Breitbart CEO Larry Solov, praised the outgoing newsroom chief. \u201cSteve is a valued part of our legacy, and we will always be grateful for his contributions, and what he has helped us to accomplish,\u201d he said. All 18 Movies and Shows Steve Bannon Wrote, Directed or Produced (Photos) 1 of 25 Bannon produced Hollywood movies in the 1990s, but most of his efforts have gone to making polemic, conservative documentaries Before he had the ear of the president, former White House Chief Political Strategist Steve Bannon tried his hand at Hollywood.

{"text":"Seeking refuge by submission:  ANALYSIS\/OPINION: Dhimmi refers to the status of non-Muslims living in an Islamic state. The word literally means \u201cprotected person by submission.\u201d But what are they protected from? The wrath of Islam! It can be likened to the mobsters who collect money from people for \u201cprotection.\u201d Non-Muslims are allowed to live in Islamic states, but with many restrictions. If these non-Muslims behave themselves and practice their own religion under the guidelines of sharia, they will not be persecuted or killed. Otherwise, the local imams and the religious leaders incite Muslims to harm the dhimmis. We have our own pro facto dhimmis in the United States. They are people who believe that if they support and promote everything Islamic, they will escape being labeled Islamophobes or attacked by Muslims. They are paying dearly for this benefit. President Trump, by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, told the world that he would not be a dhimmi. One would think when he decided to move the U.S. embassy that he had given the city to Israel, but Jerusalem has been Israeli land since the war of June 1967 and a decisive and miraculous victory. That victory led to the reunification of the Jewish people with their holy city after 2,000 years of exile. Mr. Trump, in moving the embassy to Israel\u2019s proclaimed capital and honoring the U.S. Senate vote of 1995, refused to submit as a dhimmi to the intimidation and fact twisting of the Muslim nations, who are themselves backed by the dhimmis of the United Nations. He did what nine American presidents before him were afraid to do. The Muslim nations, after their humiliating defeat in the war of 1967, refused to acknowledge the loss, and the U.N. helped them to solidify their pathological denial by issuing the infamous United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. Since then, they have continued to push that lie down the throats of the international community. Those who object to the lie and acknowledge the truth are threatened by the wrath of all ages: either be a dhimmi and support the lie, including the other famous lie that Islam is the religion of peace, or you will be slaughtered. If moving the American embassy to Jerusalem triggers a global Muslim outrage, regardless of race, country of origin or sect affiliation, that proves without any doubt that Islam is a political movement that is adamant and relentless to push its ideology on all other religions and all other nations. They seek domination above all else; historical facts be damned. The mainstream media, giving a platform to people like Hillary Clinton, blame Mr. Trump\u2019s lack of submission to Islam for a predicted rise in jihad around the globe. They claim, and try to convince us, that his lack of being dhimmi causes harm to our soldiers and to our country, and that his comments cause an increase in ISIS recruits. How many times have we heard this lie from the media and Hillary Clinton? Dhimmis are submitting to Islam for one reason: their own personal safety. In the long term, their submission means they are giving up their country and their freedom. It begins with closing their eyes to Muslim kids who come to school with black and blue marks after being beaten by their parents and not reporting it. It goes on to police departments who call honor killings \u201cdomestic abuse,\u201d or excusing rapes and molestation as \u201ccultural norms;\u201d to not hosting Christmas events or wearing a cross necklace because it might offend a Muslim. Yes, there is a growing population in the U.S. who have already become dhimmis, and if their choices only affected themselves, that would be their choice. The problem, however, is that most of these people are in places of power, either economically, politically, or religiously, and they are dragging a host of others into the dhimmi spiral with them. My heart sinks when I think America could go the way of all those countries in the Middle East that used to be Christian, like my home country of Egypt. I see what is happening in Europe and I see Islam knocking at our door as well. If you study history as I have, you know their methodology and their goals; they have never changed. We have a choice: we can either stick our heads in the sand or we can take a stand. I choose to take a stand and pray for God\u2019s wisdom and grace to do His will in all things. \u2022 Mark Christian, a physician, is an ex-Sunni Muslim, counter-terrorism expert and a frequent speaker and lecturer on all aspects of political Islam.

{"text":"A small-R republican gripe: Can we stop capitalizing \u2018president\u2019?!:  National Park Service workers clear snow on the North Lawn of the White House, Thursday, Jan. 4, 2018, in Washington. (AP Photo\/Andrew Harnik) ANALYSIS\/OPINION: Somewhere along the way of writing up information about the president \u2014 that\u2019s president with a small \u201cp\u201d in this context, not capital \u201cP\u201d \u2014 grammar-tarians lost their grammatical compass. Or maybe it was political hacks, either unschooled, unconcerned or undisciplined about the finer points of proper punctuation, or worse, purposely trying to turn the president into a All Hail the President with a capital \u201cP,\u201d no matter the context. Who knows. Either way, what\u2019s happened is they started writing President when it should be president. It\u2019s been going on for some time, pre- Donald Trump, pre-Barack Obama, even. But it\u2019s becoming more common-place. And it\u2019s time to nip it in the bud. This is not simply a Grammar Police matter. This is a particular gripe because it places the president in a spot of honor he just doesn\u2019t deserve \u2014 really, in a place of respect that better belongs with the People, or the Citizens, or maybe even the Taxpayers. Better to capitalize those words than \u201cpresident.\u201d You see, when president is President, even when grammar says he should be president, the message to the reader is this: The President is a Very Important Person \u2014 so important that even his title must always be capitalized. But lookie here. We don\u2019t even do that with God. Why so with president-slash-President? In a January 3 email from the White House Office of Communications, a statement from President Trump read this way: \u201cSteve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency.\u201d Wrong. It\u2019s presidency, small \u201cp.\u201d In a December email from the same office, it was more of the same, with a message that opened, \u201cThe President,\u201d that should have read \u201cThe president.\u201d This isn\u2019t just coming from the ideological right. In a January 4 email from the left-leaning pro-immigrant nonprofit, America\u2019s Voice, a statement read: \u201cFor some Republicans \u2026 the strategy is pretty clear: pretend you want a deal (because the President has said he wants one \u2026 \u201c Again, it\u2019s \u201cthe president,\u201d people. It\u2019s not just emailed notifications. It\u2019s official WhiteHouse.gov communications, notifications and posts. \u201cWhich President served as a lieutenant colonel in the Spanish-American war?\u201d asks the WhiteHouse.gov post on \u201cPresidents.\u201d And this, the most recent posting from the White House\u2019s James S. Brady Press Briefing Room site, a transcript of Sarah Huckabee Sanders during her January 4 press conference: \u201cThe President\u2019s economic agenda \u2026 \u201c The official White House Twitter feed is filled with even more of the maddening capitalization errors. From January 5: \u201cand, the President\u2019s emphasis \u2026\u201d From January 3: \u201cIn speeches over the past year, the President has called \u2026\u201d From January 2, a retweet from Pence\u2019s own account: \u201cThis President has delivered.\u201d From December 28, against from @WhiteHouse\u2019s account: \u201cThe President\u2019s FY 2018 Budget requests another $500M.\u201d No. No, no, no, no, no and no once more. These are not simple faux pas, the work of grammar-challenged entities. They\u2019re elevations of importance that should not be. It\u2019s President Trump, but Trump, the president \u2014 just like it\u2019s God is God, but the president is not a god. And perhaps, that\u2019s a good way to remember it. The president of the United States, no matter how honorable, no matter how great, no matter how awesome of all awesomeness in policy, politics and partisan bent, is still, here in America, a servant. A servant of the people. A servant of the American people. His title is not one of reverence. His name isn\u2019t spoken in hushed whispers. Moreover, America is not a nation that regards titles with awe or reverence. We\u2019re all equal here \u2014 no caste system in sight. So let\u2019s remember: The White House chief is just a dude. He\u2019s not God, or even a god. Let\u2019s put the \u201cp\u2019s\u201d into proper grammatical context. If anyone deserves a consistently capitalized letter \u2014 outside of God, that is \u2014 it\u2019s the citizens who elect, the taxpayers who employ, the patriots who defend.

{"text":"Trump\u2019s opportunity to shine:  Illustration on aiding freedom in Iran through discontinuing the JCPOA deal by Alexander Hunter\/The Washington Times more &amp;gt; ANALYSIS\/OPINION: The Iranian election of 2009, re-electing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was so obviously fixed that the results ignited a near-revolt that threatened the terror-sponsoring regime of the ayatollahs. The Green Movement, led by prominent Iranians including former premier Hossein Mousavi, seriously threatened the regime that has been an implacable enemy of the United States since it came to power in 1979. The rebellion\u2019s failure was assured by President Obama. Instead of helping the protesters, Mr. Obama criticized them, saying that they didn\u2019t represent \u201cfundamental change.\u201d He spoke meekly, saying that, \u201cThe world is watching and inspired by their participation, regardless of what the ultimate outcome of the election was.\u201d Mr. Obama did far worse. We know, from Wall Street Journal reporter Jay Solomon\u2019s book, \u201cThe Iran Wars,\u201d that the CIA approached Mr. Obama seeking permission to engage in a secret campaign to help the Greens overthrow the ayatollahs. Mr. Obama ordered the CIA to sever contacts with that movement and not take action against the Iranian regime. The Green Movement was suppressed. In his 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama spoke often of his willingness to negotiate with Iran. His administration first made contact with Iran in 2011. As those negotiations proceeded for the next four years, Mr. Obama feared negative publicity about Iran that could have interfered. To minimize it, he stopped a long-standing DEA investigation called \u201cOperation Cassandra\u201d investigating drug trafficking and money laundering by Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed terrorist network that governs Lebanon. In September 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry signed the Iran nuclear weapons deal. It was, as President Trump has said repeatedly, the worst possible deal. Not only did it enable Iran to continue its nuclear weapons development in secret, it reduced or eliminated the international sanctions that forced it to the bargaining table. Iran, like every other despotism, is neither monolithic nor stable. On Dec. 28, 2017, massive protests broke out across Iran threatening the ayatollah\u2019s regime. This time the protesters are demonstrating against unemployment, a weak economy, the corruption of the regime and its military adventurism in Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere. Some protesters have chanted \u201cdeath to Khamenei,\u201d the ruling ayatollah, and have attacked Basij militiamen sent out to quash the protests, both unheard of even in the 2009 nascent rebellion. These events give Mr. Trump the opportunity to remedy his predecessor\u2019s mistakes. He can, and should, seize that opportunity quickly. President Trump has already done better than his predecessor. On Jan. 1 he tweeted, \u201cIran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food  ; for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!\u201d Iran\u2019s enmity toward us is no less than it was in 2009. Its sponsorship of Islamic terrorism across the globe has, if anything, increased. The president can, and should, do a lot more than engage in a Twitter exchange with current Iranian President Rouhani. There will be escalating violence against the Iranian protesters. The regime\u2019s police and Basij militia have already killed dozens. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, the regime\u2019s military arm, is likely to soon move against the protesters. Many more will die, probably resulting in the complete suppression of the current protests. But as these protests and the Green Movement of 2009 proved, the ayatollahs\u2019 regime is vulnerable. Regardless of what happens to the Iranian protesters in the next weeks, Mr. Trump needs to act decisively. What Mr. Obama forbade in 2009 Mr. Trump should authorize in 2018. The CIA will have plans to fund and help the opposition organize fomenting revolution in Iran to oust the ayatollahs and return Iran to a semblance of freedom. That covert action can be authorized by a secret \u201cpresidential determination,\u201d which Mr. Trump should sign as soon as possible. Later this month, Mr. Trump will again face the problem of certifying Iran\u2019s compliance with Mr. Obama\u2019s nuclear deal. Last October he refused to do that. Now he can do more. Mr. Trump again said, correctly, that the deal as one of the worst and one-sided deals America has ever made. This month, he will be strongly advised against revoking the deal by a host of senators, diplomats from Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia, as well, in all likelihood, by his national security adviser. Those opposing revocation of the deal will argue that the \u201cinternational community\u201d stands behind it, pointing to the U.N. Security Council\u2019s action approving the deal. Mr. Obama substituted that action for ratification by the senate, which would have made it a treaty. The Security Council\u2019s action neither binds Mr. Trump nor has any legal effect under U.S. law. Mr. Obama\u2019s deal was not only the worst deal he could have made. It was \u2014 like his refusal to authorize the CIA to topple the regime and his order stopping the DEA\u2019s Operation Cassandra \u2014 an action directly in contravention of our most important national security interests. By revoking Mr. Obama\u2019s deal, Mr. Trump can both take strong action in our national security interests and pressure our allies to open their eyes to one of the gravest dangers we all face. It\u2019s time for him to do so. \u2022 Jed Babbin, a deputy undersecretary of defense in the George H.W.

{"text":"Chelsea Clinton Attempts To BURN Republicans In Tweet, Instead Massively INSULTS Michelle Obama: No, you can\u2019t have your pudding, EVEN if you eat your beans!! My, how lib regressives change their narrative\u2026..lost souls that can never be healed! In other words mentally unstable. GEEZ!  Did you hear? Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of YOUR former President Bill Clinton and his crazy wife Hillary Clinton has just inadvertently ripped former lady Michelle Obama a new one, and it\u2019s all over Twitter. Chelsea hit her Twitter this week to give her two cents on a recent study that showed that kids learn better and are far more attentive and retain their learning when they are not hungry and eat foods that are of nutritional value to their brains and growth. \u201cResearch again confirms kids pay more attention in class  ; better retain what they\u2019re taught when they\u2019re not hungry,\u201d Clinton wrote.  When one Twitter user replied and said the study\u2019s results were obvious, Clinton used the opportunity to bash Republicans, writing that Republicans have been trying to repeal free lunches and block nutritional food requirements.  \u201cSadly, many Republicans continue to argue against free school lunches  ; breakfasts  ; against nutritional support for families,\u201d Clinton wrote. Now of course, her goal was to hit at Republicans, but what Chelsea ACTUALLY did was throw shade at former First Lady, Michelle Obama. While Obama was in office, Michelle Obama took it upon herself to overhaul school lunches on a national level and expanded the free and reduced lunch program. The problem was the changes that they implemented were not received well at all and the proof is on social media where students have posted pictures of the unappetizing and small lunches they had started receiving under Obama\u2019s plan. With captions that were anything but complimentary. So, you can imagine the response Chelsea got right? Chelsea has been getting more than the usual amount of news coverage lately even if it is negative and in reaction to some of her amazingly dumb statements. Here she is making statements about things I doubt she can be called an expert on. I wonder if she\u2019s being programmed by people who can\u2019t wait to slap \u201dChelsea 2024\u201d on their bumpers. If this is the case, then her advisers aren\u2019t any brighter than the masterminds of \u201dHillary 2016.\u201d Chelsea Clinton should just go away while she\u2019s behind. Same for her mommy.","label":1}

{"text":"Boom: CBS News Report, Bernie Sanders Comments Confirm Sweeping Benefits of GOP Tax Law: We've been having some fun at the expense of Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party's literally apocalyptic hyperbole and rhetorical overreach about the new tax reform law, showcasing examples of businesses -- large and small -- that are celebrating passage of the landmark legislation by paying out employee bonuses, raising wages, expanding, and making charitable investments. For what it's worth, here are a few additional examples that have cropped up since our last pre-Christmas post on the matter. As we await more announcements from corporations and small businesses across the country in the new year, I'd like to go back and underscore two significant developments that Matt covered over the holidays -- they're both really important. First, in a video I flagged as \" must watch\" on Twitter, CBS News delved into the personal finances of three families across the country to determine how the new tax law will impact them. Each household cut distinct profiles; a low-income single mother in North Carolina, a pair of middle-income married educators in Rhode Island, and married small business owners with three kids in California. One thing that all three families had in common: Anxiety about the GOP plan. None of them were optimistic about how the new system will affect their pocketbooks, with two families explicitly anticipating a tax hike. This reflects widespread public opposition to the bill, driven by aggressive misinformation from the Left. When an accountant ran the actual numbers, however, all three households discovered that their tax burden was going down. Watch the entire thing:  Breaking news: @CBSThisMorning asked three families for their tax returns and found that all three would receive tax cuts next year because of the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct. pic.twitter.com\/xnGvTgV3bJ\u2014 Senate Republicans (@SenateGOP) December 22, 2017  This really should not be a surprising outcome in the least, given that 80 percent of filers will see tax reductions under the bill -- yet this number cruncher's mathematical verdicts came as happy relief to these taxpayers, who'd succumbed to relentless propaganda and media malpractice. But reality did not comport with Democratic talking points. National Review's David French analyzes the importance of the CBS news segment:  Please watch this. The surprise and relief on these taxpayers\u2019 faces is palpable. I wonder why they\u2019re so surprised that their taxes are going down? https:\/\/t.co\/23GR6auqWj\u2014 David French (@DavidAFrench) December 22, 2017   This is exactly the dynamic Republicans are hoping for in 2018. Democrats and many members of the media relentlessly claimed the bill would hurt the middle class. They called it a \u201cgiveaway\u201d to corporate America and to the very rich. Polls indicated that large numbers of Americans actually thought their taxes would increase. In other words, the public debate served mainly to obscure the truth and conceal the benefits to working families. So what happens when reality intervenes and Americans by the millions see their take-home pay increase? The GOP\u2019s hope is that it will lead to a public reconsideration and a rebound in Republican fortunes at the polls. And that\u2019s certainly possible. There has been an enormous amount of doom-mongering in the media and online, and if Republicans can keep America safe and prosperous in the coming year, and if family fortunes continue to improve, then some of the hysteria may lose its bite. Eventually people tune out Chicken Little.  Click through to read his alternate scenario, which should concern a party that already trails heavily on the generic Congressional ballot. Meanwhile, Vermont Socialist Bernie Sanders -- who falsely described the Republican tax bill as a \"massive attack\" on the middle class -- was forced to admit that actually, 91 percent of middle class earners will receive a tax cut under this \"massive attack,\" calling it a \"very good thing.\" What a rhetorical shift:  . @jaketapper: \u201cNext year, 91% of middle income Americans will receive a tax cut. Isn\u2019t that a good thing?\u201d @BernieSanders: \u201cYeah, it is a very good thing. And that\u2019s why we should\u2019ve made the tax cuts for the middle class permanent\u201d #CNNSOTU https:\/\/t.co\/ei8xTHGo1E\u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) December 24, 2017  Ninety-one percent. Bernie's complaint about the law is that the individual rate cuts were not made permanent. Republicans built in a \"sunset\" date for the tax cuts (a point we've addressed multiple times) so that they would hit certain revenue and budgetary targets in order to comply with reconciliation rules. Permanent tax cuts would have shown up as more lost revenue, thus growing deficits larger than their budget rules would allow. Senate Democrats, well aware of this dynamic, offered an amendment to make the cuts permanent, which would have blown up the bill (yes, Republicans could have radically altered the bill, trading away other measures they believe will spur economic growth to make the individual rate cuts permanent). Republicans voted it down. But remember: The only reason that the GOP was forced to play these numbers games was because they needed to pass the bill with a simple majority. Why? Zero Democrats in either chamber were willing to go along with their plan. Now that the bill has been passed and signed into law, and considering that Democrats got a lot of mileage out of the \"corporate cuts are permanent, but individual cuts expire\" attack, Rich Lowry has a good idea:  First thing Republicans should do when they are back is make Democrats vote on extending all the middle-class tax cuts https:\/\/t.co\/YVSd9q8XLy\u2014 Rich Lowry (@RichLowry) December 24, 2017  We've been arguing all along that the \"expiration date\" exploited by liberals to advance deeply misleading and cherry-picked claims about the legislation was always a fiction. Recent experience and strong political incentives each dictate that middle class tax cuts will not be allowed to disappear eight years down the line. Sanders just confirmed that on CNN. If one of the most liberal members of the Senate wants those cuts to be permanent, Republicans should oblige him with a vote. Tailor a new bill very narrowly to permanently extend the new law's tax cuts that benefit working class and middle income Americans. Bring it up as a stand-alone bill, \" fill the tree\" on Senate amendments, then let the Democrats vote on it. If they vote yes, they'll explode one of their only reasonably-defensible arguments against the bill (their alleged concerns about deficits -- a serious issue, I might add -- are laughable) while essentially conceding how helpful the law really is to middle income Americans (contra their entire mendacious messaging strategy). If they vote no, they'll be opposing their own idea, confirming that they cynically offered it just a few weeks ago solely as a means to derail the legislative process; they'd also highlight how the Democratic Party is the only party standing in the way of avoiding the future middle class tax hike about which Congressional Democrats say they're so terribly worried. Jam 'em, Paul and Mitch. I'll leave you with a few additional examples of the misperceptions and lies that have taken root, which bear no resemblance to reality. First, I had a liberal relative in California inform me over the holidays that the majority of Californians will see tax increases because of the Republican law. In fact, 87 percent of Californians will receive a tax cut in 2019, with a vast majority (67 percent) still in the \"winner\" column even in 2027 -- after the unlikely \"expiration\" of cuts. The story I linked cites a poll showing a majority of California voters opposing a law that will directly benefit nearly nine in ten taxpayers. And then there's this bonkers column, which attempts to recast a sweeping tax cut -- benefiting 80 percent of households, and reducing taxes on average across every income group -- as \"by far\" the \"largest tax increase\" in American history. This is upside-down, pants-on-fire, utterly false, propaganda:  Criticisms of the tax bill are growing increasingly unhinged and bizarre.Apparently the bill's legitimate criticisms (of which there are several) are not sufficiently apocalyptic. https:\/\/t.co\/8dNxZZCXcC\u2014 Brian Riedl (@Brian_Riedl) December 23, 2017  The column's author and his editors should be embarrassed to have run these lies. And then there's this:  Two viral #taxreform tweets -- one from a celebrity, one from a random dude -- have been shared  ; liked hundreds of thousands of times. They're both factually false. Tax law maintained teacher\/supply deduction, and SS\/Medicaid sent no such letters based on invented claim: pic.twitter.com\/HJfRGMFKnL\u2014 Guy Benson (@guypbenson) December 24, 2017  The sheer volume of lies and misinformation flying around about this law is frustrating and very telling.","label":1}
{"text":"Criminal Minds - Blue Angel - Review: \u201cRetribution\u201d: AN Criminal Minds Reviews Don\u2019t let the title of this review fool you. Despite its ominous tone, it\u2019s only in reference to this episode\u2019s case. Yes, just like with our last episode, this is another typical case of the week outing, with all the drama being confined only to the case itself. Unlike the previous case, however, this one wasn\u2019t quite so clear-cut and predictable. That\u2019s a good thing, too, as it kept me, and likely many other viewers guessing for much of the episode, and gave us some intriguing and genuinely unsettling moments along the way. This episode also gave us a glimpse into new team member Matt Simmons\u2019 home life. Since those who watched \u201cBeyond Borders\u201d got to know him pretty well on there, they kept the \u201cpersonal life\u201d bits fairly brief, but even then, it was a nice bit of light, fluffy distraction, which, given all we\u2019ve seen these characters go through thus far, was a welcome change of pace. The moments with Matt were also a nice balance to the dark and creepy nature of the case itself. Thankfully, the show spared us seeing any grotesque images this week, but our imaginations weren\u2019t quite as lucky, if the descriptions we heard throughout are anything to go by. Brace yourselves as we prepare to wade through this messed up nightmare. The Case: Things start off on a mysterious note, as we see a car driving into a dark, wooded area. A person decked out in black, their face completely shrouded, grabs some sharp instruments, so it\u2019s pretty clear at this point that something nefarious is afoot. Sure enough, that winds up being true, as the mystery person enters some sort of building, where there\u2019s even more sharp instruments, along with a wheelchair. They seem to be examining if the place is ready, and evidently it is, as they return to their car shortly afterward, only to reveal somebody is being held captive in the trunk. A poor guy\u2019s already crappy night is about to get even worse. That poor guy\u2019s name, as we soon learn is Curtis, and Emily informs us, and the team, of the nightmare he suffered. Garcia tries to be as delicate as possible as she helps fill in the details, but even then, the facts are still pretty graphic. Curtis was hung in the warehouse, after having suffered all sorts of severe injuries \u2013 cuts and bruises and the like. Oh, yeah, and the unsub completely chopped off his entire manhood as well. So that\u2019s disturbing. Reid\u2019s reaction to this unpleasant bit of news was pretty similar to mine. As is par for the course with this show, this is clearly not the unsub\u2019s first kill, either. A man named Darrel had been found dead recently as well, and sure enough, he was murdered the same way Curtis was. Tara and Matt throw out a few potential theories regarding the graphic nature of these murders; she suggests potential drug cartels, while he wonders if this is the work of the Chaldean Mafia, a brutal and notorious organization based out of Detroit. Matt had become familiar with their crimes when he worked in that state years prior. As the team prepare to head out to Detroit, we see another man being held captive and pleading for his life, so yep, there\u2019ll soon be a new body waiting for the team when they arrive. Judging from what little info the team can gleam about Curtis and Darrel, they don\u2019t seem like obvious targets. Curtis was an attorney, and that job comes with its own risks, but this sort of murder seems a bit over the top in terms of potential retaliation. And Darrel was about as mild-mannered as they come. However, both men did recently withdraw nearly ten thousand dollars, which, naturally, gets the red flags up. People generally don\u2019t pull that large an amount of money just for the heck of it. Later, when Matt and Emily interview Curtis\u2019 wife, they get a better idea of just why Curtis could\u2019ve been using that money. According to her, Curtis handled the family finances, and her reaction to the transactions indicates she suspected her husband was sneaking around on her. Combine that suspicion with him blowing tons of money on a woman, and the team\u2019s been down this road enough times to know what\u2019s likely going on. Curtis, and Darrel, were paying for escorts. \u201cThey were honest relationships. More honest than marriage, I\u2019d say.\u201d With Garcia\u2019s help, the team learns about a site called Blue Siren, which initially looks like your average dating site, but is quickly revealed to be an escort service website. And the woman Curtis and Darrel met up with was named Dasha. Clearly a professional name. After finding out where the Blue Siren headquarters are (apparently it\u2019s in a college sorority house, which is interesting), JJ and Luke head out there to interview a woman who works for that site. She\u2019s not there when they arrive, but another woman who worked with her tells them that her real name is actually Kimberly. She\u2019s no longer part of the Blue Siren group, but the woman confirms that Curtis and Darrel did visit the Blue Siren site, and were likely involved with Kimberly at some point. Kimberly insists that her relationships with the men she saw were purely innocent and safe, though. Emily and Matt later track down Kimberly herself, and they inform her about the murders. She\u2019s understandably horrified, and starts to fear that she might be a target as well. As a result, Emily sets up a protective detail for her, and Matt does his part by staying and keeping her company for the night. She discusses how easy it is for married men to be lured in by women like her, because of the forbidden nature of the encounter, and even attempts a slight flirtation of her own. Matt ain\u2019t biting, though. He's got a job to do, dagnabit. Elsewhere, JJ and Luke talk to Kimberly\u2019s mom, Janel. She\u2019s not happy about the life her daughter\u2019s been living, and expresses concern about her well-being. She also reveals that Kimberly\u2019s dad died when she was young, and she doesn\u2019t have any siblings, or other extended family. Seems it\u2019s pretty much just been Kimberly and her mom against the world all this time. And as Garcia soon discovers, the men in Kimberly\u2019s family all tended to die young. Odd. \u201cSick bastard made a snuff film.\u201d While all this is going on, Reid is busy examining some videotapes that had been sent to the local police. These tapes contain footage of the poor men being mercilessly tortured, and they\u2019re pretty gruesome, if the reactions of everyone watching are anything to go by. The local officers are puzzled about the means by which the tapes were sent - they were recorded on cassette, of all things. What this means about their unsub, they\u2019re still not entirely sure, but in the meantime, Reid does manage to get a few audio and visual clues as to where this warehouse is. As the team arrives to investigate the warehouse, things get even creepier and more surprising. The unsub, upon seeing the team show up, decides to destroy and set fire to the entire place, causing just enough of a distraction for them to escape. In the aftermath of the fire, the team finds a symbol related to the Chaldean Mafia, indicating Matt\u2019s initial assumption is right, and they also discover a woman\u2019s skull in the backyard as well. It\u2019s soon revealed that the skull belongs to a woman named Cynthia, and that she\u2019s apparently been dead for quite some time. This discovery comes on the heels of the recent murder of a third man named Philip. What initially looked like a relatively simple string of murders targeting men who visited escorts is becoming an increasingly complex mystery with each passing moment, as the victim type continues to change and shift. That becomes even more apparent when the unsub soon targets Janel and Kimberly themselves, managing to overpower and get past the protective detail before kidnapping them. It\u2019s at this point we finally see who our unsub is, and it turns out it\u2019s a man \u2013 and one Janel and Kimberly are apparently familiar with, if the man\u2019s chilling \u201cWelcome home\u201d greeting to them is any indication. Both women attempt to placate this guy, but he doesn\u2019t seem all that interested in listening to them. At least, not at first. Soon, though, he starts to get emotional, apologizing to Janel for abandoning her. Janel doesn\u2019t seem to like where this conversation\u2019s going and tries to stop it, but the cat slips out of the bag anyway. Kimberly soon learns the same thing the team recently discovered: Janel isn\u2019t her mom. She\u2019s her aunt. And the unsub, whose name is Gabriel, is Kimberly\u2019s father. Quite a couple big bombshells to drop at a time like this, no? Gabriel soon reveals that his main reason for his killing spree is a chance to \u201cfix everything\u201d. Once he\u2019s gotten rid of the men who took advantage of his sweet, innocent daughter, he can try and work on starting a new life with Kimberly. Second chances are all well and good, but in this particular case, yeah, thinking that\u2019s gonna be a hard sell for her, buddy. Janel soon confirms Gabriel\u2019s story, and when she goes to talk to him, Kimberly attempts to escape. A scuffle occurs, during which Janel stabs Gabriel in the back, and while he\u2019s distracted with the knife, Kimberly flees. Thankfully, before Gabriel can off Janel for good and chase after his daughter, the team arrives, pulling Kimberly and Janel to safety. Gabriel attempts his own escape, but after a brief but intense wrestling match between him and Matt, Matt gains the upper hand and takes him in. This of course begs the question: if Janel was really Kimberly\u2019s aunt, then what happened to her mother? Well, remember poor Cynthia and her skull? Yep. There\u2019s your answer. After their daughter was born back in 1996, Cynthia obviously didn\u2019t want Gabriel's mafia lifestyle to impact their child, so she\u2019d planned on leaving him. What\u2019s more, she also threatened to alert the authorities to his crimes. Gabriel couldn\u2019t have that, so he killed Cynthia and then turned Kimberly over to his sister, Janel, allowing her to raise the girl. Janel was so disturbed by her brother\u2019s criminal history that she decided to keep all of this a secret from Kimberly for years in an attempt to protect her. Unfortunately, for all Gabriel\u2019s attempts to stay out of prison, he did wind up serving some time for his crimes. After being released, he attempted to turn over a new leaf and tried to reconnect with Kimberly. Once he found out what she was doing for a living, however, he couldn\u2019t help sliding back into his old criminal ways in his own twisted attempt to protect her, and as a result, a lot of men wound up paying the ultimate price. \u201cYou\u2019re not like him.\u201d Kimberly is understandably shaken by the events of the case and all the new information she\u2019s learned, to the point where she expresses regret to Matt that he didn\u2019t kill her father. So much for any hope of a family reunion, then. She does, however, point out that Matt reminded her that good men do exist out there, and is bolstered by his kind and supportive words about herself and her aunt. Kudos to the show for giving us an unpredictable case this go-round. When I first saw the promos and sneak peeks for it, and even while observing Kimberly and Janel\u2019s behavior throughout early on, I\u2019d initially assumed our unsub would be one of those women. Maybe somebody in this organization had had enough of some shady stuff that had been going down, be it within the organization itself or with the men the women met up with, and wanted to fight back. Maybe Janel was a bitter woman whose husband had left her for, or had an affair with, a prostitute, and she wanted to destroy that system from within. Then when Garcia mentioned the fact that the men in Kimberly\u2019s family died young, I started wondering if this wasn\u2019t some sort of family affair. Perhaps Janel and Kimberly were a criminal duo. Honestly, I still kind of wish the episode had gone with that kind of premise, because I think it could\u2019ve been a rather interesting route to go, and because I feel like the story about the men in Kimberly\u2019s family dying young was a tantalizing tidbit that was ultimately left danging when it should\u2019ve been explored further. That said, I do appreciate that Gabriel\u2019s motive wasn\u2019t as clear-cut as one would initially think. The mafia aspect, while perhaps adding a little too much clutter to an already complex case, certainly provided a powerful motive for some of his murders, as well as a plausible explanation for how he became such an effective killing machine. I particularly liked the push and pull between Gabriel wanting to redeem himself and start anew with his daughter and his sister and being lured back into his old criminal ways. I wish the show had explored that struggle a little more, instead of waiting until late in the episode to bring it up, especially given how he didn\u2019t seem to show much remorse when he was holding Janel and Kimberly captive. At the same time, though, it was clear that Gabriel was a very broken and confused man, and I do think those aspects of his personality and mindset did come through well enough during his family confrontation, to where you could see his struggle to some degree. Kimberly and Janel made for intriguing characters, too. Even when Kimberly did try and come on all alluring while talking with Matt, it came off more as her just falling back on her usual means of communicating with men. I thought that was a good, subtle way to show just how much this job has affected her. And considering her comfort in knowing that Matt was a good, trustworthy man, it was clear some of her behavior towards him had been a test, too. I like that she got to see an example of a decent man in action. And I felt for poor Janel, with the thought of just how many secrets she was carrying on her shoulders for so long. I like that her protectiveness wasn\u2019t so overt, that for the most part, it came out in very realistic, quiet ways. That helped make the moment when she tried to stab Gabriel all the more shocking and powerful. Janel definitely came off as one of those \u201cbeware the quiet ones\u201d sorts. I liked seeing both women doing what they could to fight back, and that they were both savvy and had strong self-preservation instincts, both in regards to the case and their lives in general. My biggest gripes were these four aspects: 1) Could\u2019ve done without Gabriel\u2019s whole \u201cthis is why I\u2019m doing what I do\u201d speech towards the end. I get that that was supposed to be part of what unsubs like him do, but it just came off way too much like one of those \u201cbad guy stops to give a speech to the good guy about their plans\u201d moments you see in movies. I think the reveal might\u2019ve come off more intimidating and unsettling if he\u2019d forced Janel to be the one to confess everything to Kimberly, and hadn\u2019t said a word himself. 2) Much as I liked seeing Matt\u2019s physical abilities when taking Gabriel down in that alleyway, ummm...where, exactly, was his backup? Given all the team\u2019s been through lately, you\u2019d think that nobody would be going anywhere without at least one person tagging along. Matt should\u2019ve had somebody behind him the whole time. 3) Gabriel pulling the knife out of his back felt a little \u201csuper strength\u201d-y, no? Maybe if he hadn\u2019t spent so much time yammering on about why he was killing people to Janel and Kimberly, he could\u2019ve avoided being stabbed in the first place. 4) Why, exactly, was the episode called \u201cBlue Angel\u201d? Nothing in the episode gave a nod to it, except for the Blue Siren website, but even then, there was no indication that it had any angelic undertones. I\u2019m presuming the \u201cangel\u201d part could\u2019ve been referring to Kimberly, given her family\u2019s concerns about somebody as innocent as her getting caught up in this sleazy business, but even then, it feels a bit of a stretch, so...yeah. Go figure. Those issues aside, though, I think this case generally worked pretty well overall. Everyone played a role of some sort in it, the variety of potential suspects added to the mystery and suspense, and we got to sympathize with the victims along the way. Even the men who visited the website weren\u2019t necessarily evil bad guys (with the exception, perhaps, of Curtis, \u2018cause of the whole \u201ccheating on his wife\u201d thing, but yeah). This is how I want to see the cases of the week going forward \u2013 not so over the top that they become ridiculous, but with just enough zigzags throughout to keep us guessing and wondering how it will all play out. Meanwhile, back at Quantico: Not a whole lot to report on here, honestly. Reid talked to Garcia and Luke about possible ideas of things to discuss in his upcoming seminars, and we got brief peeks at Matt\u2019s home life. \u201cBeyond Borders\u201d viewers know that Matt's married and has a gaggle full of kids, and sure enough, we got to see the whole brood this episode. The kids don\u2019t show up until the end, when they all crowd into bed with their parents, but it was a cute scene nonetheless. And I liked what we saw of Matt\u2019s wife, too. Her name is Kristy, and she seems pretty darn happy with her husband\u2019s new job. When Matt was with the International Response Team, he was away a lot, but apparently, now that he\u2019s at the BAU, he has better hours and more time at home with his family. Which is interesting, considering how often this team seems to be away from home, and how common an issue this job was for other team members\u2019 relationships and families over the years. I suppose, though, it\u2019s easier to deal with the separation that comes from being in another part of the U.S. as opposed to being in another part of the world altogether. We also learned that nearly ten years into their marriage, Matt and Kristy are still as lovey-dovey as ever, to the point where he managed to tempt her back to bed for a little morning fun before work. I hope the show continues to let this marriage last. The guys on the team generally haven\u2019t had much luck in the romance department, after all \u2013 either their wives or girlfriends died, or in the case of Stephen, he was the one to be killed off. Morgan was the only male team member to go off to a happy life with Savannah. So it\u2019d be nice to have Matt and Kristy\u2019s relationship play out as well as Morgan\u2019s did. Buck the trend a little more. As for Reid, I enjoyed seeing him discussing his seminars. He was excited about them in a way that showed the old Reid spark was back (or at least, on its way back), and we also got to learn about an interesting fallacy known as \u201cthe Linda problem\u201d in the process. Long story short, it\u2019s a conjunction fallacy that deals with people\u2019s assumptions that two separate events may be connected, when it\u2019s just as probable, if not more so, that they happened completely independent of each other. It\u2019s just the sort of problem that I could see Reid being interested in, and what made it all the more fun was that Garcia was as knowledgeable about it as he was, and that they got to chat about it a bit. Always fun to be reminded of just how much Reid and Garcia have in common. It was nice to see Luke showing interest in their discussion as well, even if he agrees with Garcia that it might be a bit over most agents\u2019 heads. I personally think it\u2019d be a perfect topic to cover, given that the conjunction fallacy is something that can and has come up in this line of work before. Whether Reid does wind up discussing \u201cthe Linda problem\u201d in his seminars or not, I hope we get more glimpses at what he wants to teach, and eventually, what he does decide to teach. It\u2019s just good to see Reid acting like himself again, and having something to look forward to to boot. So that\u2019s that. Another week, another normal outing. How long this trend will continue to last, I don\u2019t know, but for now, I\u2019m fine with the peace and quiet. What did you think of the episode? Did the case play out as you\u2019d predicted, or did it provide some surprises along the way? Did you enjoy the glimpse into Matt\u2019s home life?

{"text":"Anarchists take over anti-racism protest at Worcester City Hall: Mark Sullivan Telegram  ; Gazette Staff @mcnsullivan Aug 13, 2017 at 10:56 PM WORCESTER - Masked anarchists hijacked a peaceful anti-racism rally at City Hall Plaza on Sunday, tying up traffic while marching down Main Street shouting epithets at \u201cracist cops.\u201d At least three people were arrested. The protest came at the end of the Rally Against Racism organized by the group Showing Up for Racial Justice in response to the white supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. More than 250 people, many of them parents with children, attended the 6 p.m. rally, holding signs and cheering a lineup of speakers who denounced racism and oppression. At the close of the rally, members of the anti-fascist group Worcester Antifa, kerchiefs on their faces, one carrying a black flag, scaled an off-limits staircase in the front of City Hall to hang their banner, reading \u201cPut Racism on the Run,\u201d over a balcony. When police officers told them they must leave the City Hall balcony, the crowd below shouted \u201cLet them be!\u201d and \u201cNo justice, no peace, no racist police!\u201d That was a lead-in to a march down Main Street, dozens of protesters blocking traffic while walking in the middle of the street until police ordered them back on the sidewalk. \u201cHey, hey, ho ho, these racist cops have got to go!\u201d the protesters shouted as they marched as far as 674 Main St., the Odd Fellows Building, by the Compare Foods grocery. There, a protester was arrested, prompting shouts of \u201cLet him go!\u201d The marchers turned around and headed back toward City Hall, escorted by a line of police cruisers. \u201cWhose streets? Our streets!\u201d they shouted. Police dogs inside a K9 unit wagon barked loudly. Police sirens and flashers filled the summer night air after the protesters regrouped at City Hall, then headed in the direction of the police station to bail out an arrested demonstrator. At least two more protesters were arrested on the march to the station. Police sirens drowned out the anti-police chants as the marchers passed Mechanics Hall. The main rally was a family-friendly event. Parents and children with homemade signs staked out spots around the plaza. \u201cHate has no home here,\u201d one sign read. \u201cTeach love,\u201d read another. One woman wore a \u201cResist Fascism\u201d kerchief on her head. Loree Burns, 47, of West Boylston, held a handmade sign that read \u201cOn the Side of (Love),\u201d with a large heart. She was attending with her daughter, Catherine, 15, and friend Marissa Gardner, 14. \u201cI think what happened in Charlottesville was reprehensible,\u201d Ms. Burns said. \u201cThe only thing that I could do right now is stand up in solidarity with the people of Charlottesville.\u201d The girls\u2019 signs read, \u201cWarrior of Love,\u201d and \u201cLove Makes the World Go Round.\u201d \u201cWhen I saw on the news what happened in Charlottesville, I was really disgusted and upset at what people thought was OK and was right,\u201d said Ms. Gardner. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important to organize and show the actions of a few do not really stand for all of us.\u201d Said the younger Ms. Burns: \u201cWe just need to keep the love going.\u201d Nearby, a couple in colorful tie-dyed shirts stood with their son and their collection of signs. Aimee Ledwell, 42, of Maynard, was penning \u201cEnd Racism Now\u201d on the back of a piece of poster board. Husband Joshua, 44, held their Black Lives Matter lawn sign. And son C.J., 8, had drawn a sign reading \u201cLet Love and Kindness Grow,\u201d with a picture of his cat. \u201cWe of course are always standing on the side of love,\u201d Mrs. Ledwell said. \u201cAfter the violence this weekend, we could not just stay at home and not come and stand up for what\u2019s right. So here we are.\u201d Mrs. Ledwell was asked what she hoped would be the takeaway from the anti-racism rally. \u201cThe more people who stand up the better,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more we have big crowds gathering and saying, \u2018No, this is not normal,\u2019 \u2018This is not OK,\u2019 the more people will come and join them, too. \u201cThere is still a lot of fear. People have a hard time standing up. The more people do, you get momentum. And hopefully that momentum can make a difference every time.\u201d Not 20 feet away from the family group, on the fringe of the crowd, stood several Antifa protesters, some wearing kerchiefs and black masks on their faces, holding signs that read \u201cResist Racism: Solidarity with Charlottesville.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t take my (expletive) picture,\u201d one man with a kerchief around his face told an elderly woman who was taking a photo of the rally. The masked people, who were standing over an American flag on the ground, refused to be interviewed by the Telegram  ; Gazette. \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer any of your questions,\u201d said a man with a black mask covering his face who was standing over the American flag. A woman with the group told the reporter: \u201cThis is harassment.\u201d Asked what they planned to do with the flag, she said: \u201cPlease stop harassing them.\u201d \u201cWhat are you doing with a notepad?\u201d asked another woman with the group. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want to talk to you, you can probably just (expletive) off.\u201d Asked why the others were covering their faces, she said: \u201cYou really should leave.\u201d Asked if she felt non-violence was the way, she declined to speak. The Antifa protesters, numbering perhaps a couple dozen, were a small percentage of the crowd for the main rally, which drew hundreds. Matt Vahallas, 41, of Holden, held a sign picturing the Blues Brothers, with a quote from the movie: \u201cI Hate (expletive) Nazis.\u201d Mr. Vahallas said he was inspired to attend by the weekend\u2019s swastika-waving demonstration in Charlottesville. \u201cI thought World War II solved that problem,\u201d he said. Toward the end of the rally, the crowd was encouraged to join in chants. \u201cNo Trump, No KKK, No Fascist USA,\u201d they shouted. Then: \u201cWhat do we want? Justice! If we don\u2019t get it? Shut it down!\u201d Soon thereafter, the Antifa people scaled the City Hall stairs, hung their banner from the balcony, and the mood turned. The main Rally Against Racism was organized by the Worcester chapter of the activist organization Showing Up for Social Justice in response to the events in Charlottesville. \u201cPart of (our) cause is to call out racism and call white people into action when things like that happen,\u201d said an organizer, Etel Haxhiaj, 37, of Worcester. Ms. Haxhiaj, interviewed in advance of the rally, was asked about Antifa. She declined to comment on the group. Seven members of the group Worcester Antifa - short for Worcester Anti-Fascist Action \u2014 were arrested in February during a protest in downtown Worcester in which they blocked traffic while chanting profane slogans against police, the Ku Klux Klan and fascism. The Antifa movement nationally and internationally describes its approach as \u201ca confrontational response to fascist groups, rooted in militant left-wing and anarchist politics,\u201d according to the magazine The Nation.","label":0}
{"text":"Trump Embraces the Culture War: Patrick J. Buchanan Donald Trump on the campaign trail in March 2016. Credit:Windover Way Photography To attend the Indianapolis Colts game where the number of the legendary Peyton Manning was to be retired, Vice President Mike Pence, a former governor of Indiana, flew back from Las Vegas. With him in the stadium was his wife Karen. In honor of Manning, she wore a No. 18 jersey as \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d began. The Pences stood, hands over hearts. A dozen San Francisco 49ers took a knee. When the national anthem ended, Pence walked out. His limousine took him back to the airport to fly to LA. \u201cA stunt! That plane trip cost taxpayers $250,000,\u201d wailed a media that was rarely critical of Michelle Obama\u2019s million-dollar junkets with Sasha and Malia. The president took credit for Pence\u2019s walkout, tweeting, \u201cI asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled.\u201d Pence\u2019s statement: \u201cI left today\u2019s Colts game because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.\u201d As Pence had left his press pool in the motorcade, and said he might not be too long, the walkout may not have been entirely spontaneous. But the game had been on Pence\u2019s calendar for weeks. What does this episode tell us? In the culture wars, Trump has rejected compromise or capitulation and decided to defend the ground on which his most loyal folks stand. Example: While The Washington Post was reporting Monday that Austin, Seattle, San Francisco, and Denver had now joined Los Angeles in replacing Columbus Day with Indigenous People\u2019s Day, Trump issued a Columbus Day proclamation of bristling defiance. \u201cFive hundred and twenty-five years ago, Christopher Columbus completed an ambitious and daring voyage across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas. \u2026 a remarkable and then-unparalleled feat that helped launch the age of exploration and discovery. The permanent arrival of Europeans to the Americas was a transformative event that \u2026 changed the course of human history and set the stage for the development of our great Nation.\u201d Columbus, said Trump, was a \u201cskilled navigator and man of faith, whose courageous feat brought together continents and has inspired countless others to pursue their dreams and convictions \u2014 even in the face of extreme doubt and tremendous adversity.\u201d The Admiral of the Ocean Sea \u201cwas a native of the City of Genoa, in present day Italy, and represents the rich history of important Italian American contributions to our great Nation. \u2026 Italy is a strong ally and a valued partner,\u201d said Trump. His proclamation failed to mention indigenous peoples. How did CNN receive it? Not at all well. \u201cTrump\u2019s Praise of Columbus Omits Dark History,\u201d ran the CNN headline. Lede sentence: \u201cNever mind the disease and slavery wrought by Christopher Columbus\u2019 voyage \u2014 or the fact that he didn\u2019t actually \u2018discover\u2019 the New World.\u201d Trump\u2019s proclamation closed a week in which he rolled back the Obamacare mandate requiring employers and institutions, against their religious beliefs, to provide contraceptives and abortion-inducing pills to employees. Religious groups cheered. The ACLU fumed. The in-your-face defiance of the dictates of political correctness has solidified Trump\u2019s base behind him. And Americans are coming to accept our new reality: On the essentials of nationhood \u2014 ancestry, morality, faith, culture, history, heroes \u2014 we really are no longer one nation and one people. All weekend, viewers of cable TV were treated to self-righteous wailing from the acolytes of Colin Kaepernick, patron saint of the 49ers, that \u201ctaking the knee\u201d to protest racism and racist cops is a most admirable exercise of the First Amendment right to protest. What Trump\u2019s folks are saying in response is this: \u201cYou may have a First Amendment right to disrespect our flag, or even to burn it, but you have no right to make us listen to you, or respect you, or buy tickets to your games, or watch you on Sunday.\u201d And with shrinking audiences watching NFL games, declining attendance, and advertisers beginning to bail, the NFL appears belatedly to be getting the message. Jerry Jones, owner of one of the most valuable franchises in the league, has told players that anyone who does not show respect for the flag during the national anthem does not play that day for the Dallas Cowboys. \u201cPresident Trump has a duty to unite us, not divide us\u201d is the mantra of our elites. Yet since the \u201960s, it is these elites who have been imposing the social, moral, and cultural revolution the American people never voted for and which has by now divided us irretrievably. Call them \u201cdeplorables\u201d if you will, but Trump does seem to relish going out to defend the views, values, and beliefs of the people who put him where he is. He does not recoil from political conflict. People who stand by you in a fight are not all that common in politics. When Trump exhibits this quality, he receives in reciprocity the kind of loyalty even his enemies concede he has. Patrick J. Buchanan is the author of a new book, \u201cNixon\u2019s White House Wars: The Battles That Made and Broke a President and Divided America Forever.\u201d","label":1}
{"text":"Gender Ideology\u2019s Kindergarten Commissars: E-mail Rod Follow @roddreher Jazz Jennings, the boy who has become a transgender icon (lev radin\/Shutterstock) If you, being a monstrous bigot, didn\u2019t take your small child to drag queen story hour at your public library or bookstore, don\u2019t despair. In some places, publicly funded schools are stepping in to compensate for your neglect on exposing your kids to gender diversity. For example:  Angry parents stampeded a California charter school board meeting Monday after a teacher read her kindergarten class picture books about transgenderism to affirm a gender dysphoric classmate. During the class, parents say, the gender dysphoric boy also switched clothes to look more like a girl in a \u201cgender reveal.\u201d Parents were not notified beforehand of the discussion or the classmate\u2019s psychological condition, and learned about it when their confused kindergarteners arrived home from school that day. \u201cThe kindergartners came home very confused, about whether or not you can pick your gender, whether or not they really were a boy or a girl,\u201d Karen England of the Capitol Resource Institute told CBS News. \u201cMy daughter came home crying and shaking so afraid she could turn into a boy,\u201d a parent said at the public meeting.  This is not a one-off situation. As Joy Pullman explains, it\u2019s part of a strategy by transgender advocates. She discusses how the litigious parents of a trans tot sued a public charter school into compliance with their desires. More:  Nova is a test case for what trans activists want to perpetuate nationwide \u2014 and not just in public schools, but also in private and home schools. An 8-year-old drag queen groomed by his parents says \u201cIf you want to be a drag queen and your parents don\u2019t let you, you need new parents,\u201d the underlying, totalitarian belief of the movement he represents. The easiest initial access point is private school choice programs, but activists are also targeting all private schools through accreditation bodies. The accreditation attack is currently most visible in higher education, but it\u2019s spreading to K-12.  Yesterday I heard from a Washington, DC, reader whose children attended a public charter school, until he and his wife found out what the school was doing behind their backs. He sent me the e-mail chain between him and the school\u2019s principal. I reproduce it here with his permission, and with the names of the people involved and the school redacted:  Dear [Principal], Raising little ones is hard these days, particularly because \u2014 even by ages five and six \u2014 kids on the playground are educating them about topics I didn\u2019t even know much about until I was a preteen. Consequently, my wife and I began talking to the girls about sexuality in age-appropriate ways last year. It\u2019s a sensitive area, but we wanted to go ahead and introduce our values to them early on, before a kid at school did and potentially caused confusion. In that spirit, last weekend I decided to talk to the girls about the topic of people who identify as transgendered. Shortly after starting the conversation, however, I learned that [their teacher] had already talked to [our daughter] and her classmates about it. This involved her reading a book called \u201cI Am Jazz\u201dand conducting a classroom discussion on the topic. First of all, let me say this: [my wife] and I think a lot of [the teacher]. She has been an excellent teacher and [our daughter] has seen great progress in her class. Furthermore, she has made a point to encourage us and compliment [our daughter\u2019s] progress anytime she sees us. She\u2019s a good and professional teacher, and I suppose that\u2019s part of the reason we were so disappointed. We wouldn\u2019t have expected it from her. And even though I\u2019m sure she meant well, those good intentions don\u2019t make [our daughter\u2019s] experience any more appropriate, especially because I had already let the school know my wishes about any such discussion with the students. Before enrolling the girls, I explicitly told you that if there was any reason the school felt the need to discuss topics including sexuality, marriage norms, or gender identity, I wanted to be notified so that my children could be excused, giving me the opportunity to decide when they were ready for that discussion. You assured me that the school would never even broach these subjects with the kids. Just to be on the safe side, however, at our home visits, I also explicitly told the teachers the same. The classroom was not the place to conduct a discussion like this with first graders \u2014 the home is. [Our daughter] was confused by the discussion and book, and it required me to spend 20 minutes just to undo the odd and incorrect conclusions she drew about transgendered individuals from [the teacher\u2019s] lesson and even the storyline of the book. That confusion could\u2019ve been avoided by giving parents notification beforehand or not even discussing it at all with first graders. The sad thing is that I would\u2019ve never even known it happened if I hadn\u2019t decided to have this conversation that, quite frankly, I thought might be a little too mature for their ages. But we can\u2019t unspill the milk, so I am asking you to do the following to make things right: (1) notify all parents about what happened so they can have a chance to discuss this with their own children; (2) apologize to all of us for exploring this topic with our kids without seeking our permission; (3) inform all parents of any other instances in which such a discussion happened or any comments were made regarding gender identity, marriage norms, and sexuality; and (4) let us know what remedial measures the school will take to ensure this will not happen again. Despite the excellent job you all are otherwise doing, this was a violation of every parents\u2019 trust and rooted in the assumption that we are all in agreement with the ideology of the staff members. But more importantly and fundamentally, even if parents are in agreement with the ideology of staff members, this decision assumed that the school, rather than parents, is in the best position to decide when to approach hard topics like this with our children. It is not my intent to discourage [the teacher] at all \u2014 again, we have otherwise been so pleased with her work with [our daughter] this year; but I just can\u2019t overlook this breach of trust and I think other parents also have a right to know it happened so they can address it at home as necessary. Thank you for your attention to this matter.  Having not heard from the principal, the father wrote:  [Principal], [my wife] and I were hoping to hear back from you about our email to you. Maybe it would be better if we met in person. When are you available in the next two weeks?  The principal responded:  We are the height of planning for school opening. My apologies I did not respond sooner. As a mother and school leader, I can empathize with the challenge of keeping up with what our children are exposed to and wanting to be their first teacher on so many issues. I also think well of [the teacher]. She has shown herself to be a proficient teacher and student advocate. I do not recall a conversation about how we would handle conversations about transgender issues, but I cannot imagine agreeing either to censure such material or inform you in advance. I am sorry if [the teacher] or I led you to believe such a request would be honored. The book used is one that is a respected text in honoring the diversity of our children. It is a text that explains a real situation that many children face in self-acceptance, acceptance by others and being true to themselves. We feel the classroom is the appropriate place to share such messages. We would not request that these themes require permission, or clearance with families. (Different than courses on sexual education, for which we do require permission.) Quite the contrary, families have asked that we enhance our curriculum to be more inclusive of all the different groups our children and families represent, and we feel that this book achieves this purpose. I stand by [the teacher\u2019s] use of the book in class, her decision to share the text, and the importance of these texts in the elementary classroom. I am happy to meet with you to listen or answer any other questions you might have. My time is limited in this month, but I will do my best.  The father replied:  Thanks for getting back in touch with me, [principal]. I realize that you are busy, but do you mind meeting with [my wife] and me briefly before the week is over? We would like to tie up the discussion, but we think it might contribute to mutual understanding if we do it in person.  The principal replied:  I am not available until the school year begins as we are feverishly working to train teachers, prepare the building and open school. I am copying [my assistant] who can help us set up something for the first week of school.  To which the father wrote:  We still want to get together with you, but if we aren\u2019t able to talk before the school year begins, we would at least like to make sure we understood your email correctly. [My wife] and I would like our children to be exempt from any classroom discussions or instruction relating to the topics of gender identity, marital norms, or sexuality. We would also like to be informed before any such discussions take place in the classroom. I would like to know if the school will honor that request. Thanks in advance for letting us know. We know that these are sensitive topics that require great care, which is why we want to be the first ones to talk to our children about it.  The principal did not respond. Six days later, the father wrote:  [Principal], I appreciate how busy you are right now, but if you could please answer the question I emailed last week, I would appreciate it. Good luck with school prep!  The principal responded:  Thank you for understanding that this is an extremely busy time. I will not exempt any child from classroom discussions or instruction relating to the topics of gender identity, and \u2018marital norms\u2019. As it relates to formal instruction regarding sexuality, and sexual reproduction I will ask for your permission before these concepts are introduced in 4th grade. When they are introduced, I can say they are conducted with cultural humility and inclusivity\u2013 thoughtful of all our children and all their families.  The parents removed their two children from this public charter school last week in light of the principal\u2019s refusal to respect their wishes or even to tell them when gender identity is going to be discussed in their elementary school classes. I asked the father if he wanted to go public with this, naming the school \u2014 in which case I would need to use their names, and call the principal and the teacher for comment. He said no, that they don\u2019t want a public fight over this issue:  We just want to raise awareness and encourage parents to ask their children direct questions about this kind of stuff. If I hadn\u2019t brought up this topic with my daughter, I would\u2019ve never known what she was exposed to, nor would I have known that the school was systematically indoctrinating kids and doing so behind the backs of parents who had asked them to do otherwise.  Let this be a lesson to you, reader. Do you know what your child\u2019s school\u2019s policy is? Do you know what your child\u2019s teacher thinks about introducing gender ideology to little children? You had better. Note too, per Joy Pullman, that the campaign to institute gender ideology in elementary schools is not stopping at public schools or at public charter schools. Via the accreditation process, they\u2019re going after private schools. Pullman writes:  The leftists harping on this topic are essentially demanding a religious litmus test \u2014 the adoption of the moral belief that every sexual practice must be affirmed \u2014 as a precondition for educating children. It is starting with public and private schools, but will eventually encompass \u201coutliers\u201d such as homeschoolers. None of us are safe unless we band together and stop this crazy train in its tracks. A key problem is that Republican-led statehouses are the ones guarding school choice programs, and these same statehouses can barely muster the votes to protect children in public schools from being forced into unisex shower and sleeping quarters.  I have been told by people involved in this fight that Republican state legislators are getting hammered hard by the big business lobby, which wants to see liberalization of the schools on the SOGI (sexual orientation and gender identity) front. If these legislators do not hear from their constituents, they will rightly assume that the people they represent don\u2019t care about the issue \u2014 and they\u2019ll cave. If this matters to you as a parent, educate yourself \u2014 and call your state legislator. If you homeschool or have your kids in a private religious school, do not think that you are safe. (If you don\u2019t belong to the Homeschool Legal Defense Association, join it now.) The other side is not playing around \u2014 and it has deep pockets (e.g., The Gates Foundation). In The Benedict Option, I call on Christians to prepare themselves, their communities, and their children to hold on to the truth a world in which this moral insanity is the norm. There is no way to avoid it. I also urge them to use whatever political power we have left to fight for religious liberty, which includes the right to have control over what their children are taught in the classroom on matters as fundamental as what it means to be male and female. Social and religious conservatives have lost many battles on this front, but they have not yet lost this one. But you had better be clear that the battle is here \u2014 and, as these parents above have learned, in some places it has been joined without parents even knowing what was happening. You cannot afford to be ignorant, nor can you afford to be indifferent. Never, ever forget that the Law Of Merited Impossibility is an infallible guide to progressivist culture war tactics: \u201cIt will never happen, and when it does, you bigots will deserve it.\u201d If your child\u2019s teacher has read I Am Jazz to her, and she wants to know whatever happened to Jazz Jennings, you may want to know that Jennings spoke about this in the media earlier this summer, and has been on the I Am Jazz reality show discussing vaginas at the dinner table. This is the culture we live in now: screen shot UPDATE: Reader Brendan:  I understand the call to arms on this, I really do, but I think that the battle on this has already been quite well and truly lost. The cultural Zeitgeist on this issue has a very \u201cyear before Obergefell\u201d feeling to it \u2014 in other words, the battle was already over in everything but a formal and official way, and most everyone knew it. It\u2019s the same for this issue \u2014 for all practical purposes this is over. Are there more people squeamish about MTF transwomen in the ladies room today than there were about gay marriage in, say, 2013? Probably. But that sentiment is being very exceptionally and forcefully forced into silence, just as the sentiments about SSM were. The reason is more or less the same as it was for SSM: corporate America wants it, for several reasons ranging from not wanting to alienate customers who are millenials (who are extremely pro-trans) to not wanting to seem like bigots to their socio-economic peers at the cocktail party. LGBT is a main corporate, capitalist priority currently, and it\u2019s getting pretty much the full support of almost all big enterprises. This makes the issue politically impossible, because the Democrats of course are in bed with LGBT, while the Republicans will generally do what big business wants, which in this case (as in the case of SSM) is pro-LGBT. In that context, there really isn\u2019t any way a fight can really be won here on this issue at this point. At the end of the day, what parents think on this issue doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is what big business thinks, what the mainstream media thinks, what the Academy thinks and so on. Parents don\u2019t rate, and they will be made to comply with their betters. Just watch.

He says that liberalism\u2019s post-1960s embrace of identity politics resonates with young people in \u201cour highly individualistic bourgeois society\u2014a society that keeps them focused on themselves and teaches them that personal choice, individual rights and self-definition are all that is sacred.\u201d Lilla, who is a professor of the humanities at Columbia, and who identifies himself as a \u201cfrustrated liberal,\u201d says he is struck by the difference between his liberal students and his conservative students. The conservative ones formulate opinions and make arguments based on ideas and principles. The liberal ones, though, base their arguments (such as they are) on an assertion of identity (e.g., \u201cSpeaking as a lesbian of color, I believe that\u2026\u201d). Lilla goes on:  Conservatives complain loudest about today\u2019s campus follies, but it is really liberals who should be angry. The big story is not that leftist professors successfully turn millions of young people into dangerous political radicals every year. It is that they have gotten students so obsessed with their personal identities that, by the time they graduate, they have much less interest in, and even less engagement with, the wider political world outside their heads. There is a great irony in this. The supposedly bland, conventional universities of the 1950s and early \u201960s incubated the most radical generation of American citizens perhaps since our founding. Young people were incensed by the denial of voting rights out there, the Vietnam War out there, nuclear proliferation out there, capitalism out there, colonialism out there. Yet once that generation took power in the universities, it proceeded to depoliticize the liberal elite, rendering its members unprepared to think about the common good and what must be done practically to secure it\u2014especially the hard and unglamorous task of persuading people very different from themselves to join a common effort. Every advance of liberal identity consciousness has marked a retreat of liberal political consciousness. There can be no liberal politics without a sense of We\u2014of what we are as citizens and what we owe each other. If liberals hope ever to recapture America\u2019s imagination and become a dominant force across the country, it will not be enough to beat the Republicans at flattering the vanity of the mythical Joe Sixpack. They must offer a vision of our common destiny based on one thing that all Americans, of every background, share. And that is citizenship. We must relearn how to speak to citizens as citizens and to frame our appeals for solidarity\u2014including ones to benefit particular groups\u2014in terms of principles that everyone can affirm.  And:  Black Lives Matter is a textbook example of how not to build solidarity. By publicizing and protesting police mistreatment of African-Americans, the movement delivered a wake-up call to every American with a conscience. But its decision to use this mistreatment to build a general indictment of American society and demand a confession of white sins and public penitence only played into the hands of the Republican right. I am not a black male motorist and will never know what it is like to be one. If I am going to be affected by his experience, I need some way to identify with him, and citizenship is the only thing I know that we share. The more the differences between us are emphasized, the less likely I will be to feel outrage at his mistreatment. The politics of identity has done nothing but strengthen the grip of the American right on our institutions. It is the gift that keeps on taking. Now is the time for liberals to do an immediate about-face and return to articulating their core principles of solidarity and equal protection for all. Never has the country needed it more.  The essay is adapted from The Once And Future Liberal, the new book by Lilla, which will be out next week. I\u2019ve read it. It\u2019s short, punchy, and challenging. I think we conservatives have a lot to learn from it too. I\u2019ll be writing about that next week. The Damore debacle at Google is a perfect example of what Lilla disdains in his book. Google engineer James Damore wrote an impolitic memo criticizing the way diversity is handled at Google. He said there are scientific reasons why Google\u2019s diversity initiatives aren\u2019t working to change Google\u2019s male-female employee ratio. He said clearly that he favors diversity, but thinks that science shows there are more effective ways to achieve it. And he criticized Google for being the kind of place where people who disagree with cultural progressivism cannot speak out. This got him fired. It also energized the mob of left-wing witch hunters, who piled onto Damore for his alleged sexist bigotry. Much of the hysteria had nothing to do with Damore\u2019s actual arguments. It bashed him on identity politics grounds. Never mind that Damore said in the memo that he favors diversity, and that he thinks racism and sexism are real problems. Never mind that he simply complained that the way Google pursues diversity is unfair to men. And never mind that Google provided the internal forum precisely so that its workers can discuss workplace issues. (These three facts, by the way, are why Damore might well be vindicatedin his complaint filed against Google with the National Labor Relations Board.) Very few of us outside of the scientific community are in a position to discuss intelligently the science involved in this dispute. True, some scientists have weighed in to say that Damore is on solid scientific ground in his memo (which doesn\u2019t mean it was a wise thing to share, given the cultural politics of the workplace). My guess is that most ordinary people see this case and wonder why it is that we can\u2019t discuss Damore\u2019s actual argument. Why was a guy who agreed with his company\u2019s diversity goal but not with how the company goes about trying to achieve that result fired simply for arguing \u2014 based on science! \u2014 that there is a better and more just way to achieve that goal? How does this relate to Lilla\u2019s argument? In this way. James Damore made a reasoned argument in his memo. Read it for yourself and see. That doesn\u2019t mean James Damore\u2019s conclusions are correct. Perhaps his premises are mistaken, or maybe his logic is wrong. That did not matter to Google, whose vice president for diversity denounced Damore for advancing \u201cincorrect assumptions about gender.\u201d Google\u2019s president fired him for \u201cadvancing harmful gender stereotypes.\u201d Sacramento Bee columnist Ben Boychuk points out how old-fashioned liberalism doesn\u2019t stand a chance anymore:  Any conservative who read James Damore\u2019s memo recognized at once that he holds fairly conventional liberal views of the world. But even conventional liberal viewpoints are no longer safe. Damore did not claim women are \u201cbiologically unsuited\u201d to work in tech (as, I regret to report, The Bee\u2019s editorial asserted this week). He didn\u2019t even argue against racial or gender diversity per se. On the contrary, he took pains to make clear in his opening paragraph that he values \u201cdiversity and inclusion,\u201d does not deny \u201csexism exists\u201d and doesn\u2019t \u201cendorse using stereotypes.\u201d Then what did he say? In brief, that Google\u2019s efforts to achieve 50-50 parity between male and female programmers were unlikely to succeed because a lot of women simply aren\u2019t interested in science and technology fields. And why aren\u2019t they interested? Not because they\u2019re \u201cbiologically unsuited\u201d but rather because there are biological differences that lead men and women down different paths. Mind you, Damore doesn\u2019t say he\u2019s against the company\u2019s goals for greater gender diversity; he simply argues that the executives are going about it the wrong way.  And that is still enough to get him fired. Why? Because of the left\u2019s identity politics, which keeps expanding the boundaries of things you cannot say, even if you can demonstrate that they\u2019re true, or might well be true. So, when Lilla says that \u201cthe politics of identity has done nothing but strengthen the grip of the American right on our institutions,\u201d the Damore debacle provides him with a great example. In her superb commentary on the matter, Megan McArdle talks about her own experience working as a tech consultant in the finance world, an industry heavily dominated by males, and how yes, it was more challenging as a woman because of the bros. But that\u2019s not why she left that career. She left because the guys were a lot more committed to techie things than she was. She was good enough to do that kind of work, but she just didn\u2019t have the same passion for it that her male colleagues do. So she went to work in a field that she did love with the same kind of passion. And that, she said, is what\u2019s at the core of James Damore\u2019s argument: not that women are biologically unable to do tech work, but that the kind of detailed work tech personnel at Google do disproportionately attracts males \u2014 and that is bound to affect diversity efforts. Yet McArdle says that even if you concede Damore\u2019s point, it\u2019s still probably the case that a lopsided workplace culture can be an unfriendly place for women \u2014 and this is a problem. She ends like this:  And yet, you still have to ask whether shamestorming Damore and getting him sacked was really the best way to convince him \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 that he\u2019s mistaken. Did anyone\u2019s understanding of the complex quandaries of gender diversity advance? If there were guys at Google wondering whether the women around them really deserved their jobs, did anyone wake up the morning after Damore\u2019s firing with the revelation: \u201cGood God, how could I have been so blind?\u201d No, I suspect those guys are now thinking: \u201cYou see? Women can\u2019t handle math or logic.\u201d The mob reaction did prove that women indeed have some power in tech. But the power to fire people is not why most people get into engineering. Good engineers want to make things. The conversation around Damore\u2019s memo hasn\u2019t made the world a better place, as they say in Silicon Valley. It has just made a lot of people angry.  Yes, and it has probably made a lot of people more likely to vote Republican next time. Mark Lilla can explain why.","label":1}
{"text":"Is President Trump's Immigration Order a 'Muslim Ban'?: Carlos Barria \/ Reuters Imagine the following scenario. A new presidential administration announces that \u201cpolitical turmoil and terrorism\u201d in the Middle East requires new immigration rules. From now on, visitors, immigrants and refugees from Israel will not be admitted. With one exception, that is\u2014believers in \u201cminority religions\u201d within the Jewish state (this is, most prominently, Christians and Muslims) will be allowed to enter, because they are being persecuted at home. Accused of anti-Semitism, the new administration is aghast. How could you even suspect that? Look\u2014Jews from elsewhere in the world are free to enter\u2014even from other countries with large Jewish populations! It\u2019s purely geographic! (With a small humanitarian exception, of course.) No religious test at all, just a desire to keep America safe. Move along, nothing to see. Are you buying it so far? Okay, what if we throw in these additional facts: The new president ran for office on a pledge to bar Jews from entering the United States. And the proclamation makes no mention of Judaism but specifically mentions that one of the problems with immigrants from Israel (except, of course, Christians and Muslims) is that they discriminate against women and look down on other religions. What if a presidential adviser states that the president asked him to write a ban on Jewish immigrants that would seem legal? Does \u201cpurely geographic\u201d still pass the laugh test? The constitutionality of Trump\u2019s order shutting down refugee admissions, and barring any immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations, is a complicated question. Immigration is a highly specialized constitutional area. But a constitutional lawyer would first ask: Is this, as the president has claimed, a \u201cgeographic\u201d order, targeting certain countries \u201ccompromised by terrorism\u201d? Or is it a \u201creligious test,\u201d intentionally singling out one religion for adverse treatment? The answer can be constitutionally quite important. In order to violate the Constitution\u2019s requirement of \u201cequal protection of the laws,\u201d a government measure must intentionally discriminate on the basis of a given trait. In this case, the question is whether the order intentionally discriminates against Muslims. Over the years, the courts have developed a set of tests to find \u201cintentional discrimination.\u201d They are necessary because governments often deny any intent to discriminate against a group or on the basis of a trait. (Certainly the administration denies that now.) Lawyers first look at the precise terms of a government regulation; then they look at its structure and exceptions; then they look at statements made by decision-makers; then they look at the events and procedures surrounding its adoption. The executive order fails every one of these tests. This is a religious \u201cclassification\u201d that intentionally discriminates against Muslims\u2014because of hostility to their religion. These facts of my hypothetical precisely match Trump\u2019s order. The order states as a reason for its restrictions a desire to exclude \u201cthose who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including \u2018honor\u2019 killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own).\u201d Though \u201chonor killings\u201d is not linked to any religion, its inclusion here is a dog whistle, because the term has been used by Islamophobes who claim (falsely) that it characterizes Muslim society generally. \"The order also allows immigration officials to continue to admit refugees--including refugees from the seven predominantly Muslim countries otherwise banned\u2013\u2013on a \u201ccase-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the admission of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest\u2014including when the person is a religious minority in his country of nationality facing religious persecution.\u201d * In case that last clause was unclear, Trump then announced that it was intended to give priority to Middle Eastern Christians, because they have been \u201chorribly treated,\u201d and so \u201cwe are going to help them.\u201d Candidate Trump loudly proposed a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d Trump adviser Rudolph Giuliani has proudly boasted that the new president asked him to come up with a way of implementing a \u201cMuslim ban\u201d that would be \u201clegal.\u201d In a 1977 case called Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp., the Court laid out a set of procedural tests of a government decision: Is there a history of discrimination leading up to it? Were the specific events leading to the decision unusual? Did the new policy represent a sudden change in procedures and substance? Anti-Muslim discrimination (and hate crimes) are very much a part of recent American history. The specific events leading up to the surprise order were not just unusual but bizarre. Press reports indicate that the officials responsible for refugee policy (e.g., the secretary of homeland security, Gen. John Kelly ) were not consulted or notified. The new criteria represent a radical change in immigration and refugee policy. The fact that it does not exclude all Muslim immigrants doesn\u2019t make it \u201cneutral.\u201d A rule barring Jews, but not others, from only one place still discriminates against Jews. Discrimination does not disappear simply because it is partial. The test is the intention, and the evidence of intent is plentiful here. Whether it\u2019s legal, and constitutional, is a different question. But let\u2019s not confuse ourselves: Yes, it\u2019s a \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d *This article originally stated that the executive order allowed immigration officials to admit refugees from the predominantly Muslim countries on a case-by-case basis; that provision applies to all refugees.

{"text":"President Trump applauds son's 'transparency': Trump Jr. allowed Tuesday night in an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News Channel that \"he has probably met with other people from Russia\" but insisted that he did not attempt to coordinate to impact the election or try to damage Hillary Clinton. He repeatedly suggested that the charges of collusion were \"ridiculous\" and \"overplayed\" and insisted that his father knew nothing about the June 2016 meeting. \"It was such a nothing there was nothing to tell\" his father, said Trump Jr. Donald Trump Jr. eagerly accepted help from what was described to him as a Russian government effort to aid his father's campaign with damaging information about Hillary Clinton, according to the emails. The email exchange posted to Twitter by President Donald Trump's eldest son shows him conversing with a music publicist who wanted him to meet with a lawyer from Moscow. The publicist describes the lawyer as a \"Russian government attorney\" who has dirt on Clinton as \"part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\" In one response, Trump Jr. says he would \"love\" to hear more. President Donald Trump says his eldest son is \"a high-quality person,\" and he applauds \"his transparency.\" In a tweet Tuesday night, the president promoted his son's appearance on Fox News and called him a \"great person who loves our country.\"  My son, Donald, will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10:00 P.M. He is a great person who loves our country!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2017  White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders read a brief statement from the president Tuesday in response to revelations that Trump Jr. agreed to hear damaging information on Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government's effort to help his father. Trump Jr., who was deeply involved in his father's presidential campaign, released the emails along with a statement describing the disclosure as an effort \"to be totally transparent.\" The emails with publicist Rob Goldstone show that Trump Jr. was told that the Russian government had information that could \"incriminate\" Clinton and her dealings with Russia.  Here's my statement and the full email chain pic.twitter.com\/x050r5n5LQ\u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2017  The messages were the latest disclosure to roil the ongoing investigation into potential coordination between Trump's campaign and Russia, which U.S. intelligence agencies have said sought to influence the outcome of the election in Trump's favor. As congressional committees and Special Counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, investigate, the emails will almost certainly be reviewed for any signs of potential campaign collusion with the Kremlin, which the White House has repeatedly denied. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment on the emails, citing the ongoing investigation.  Here is page 4 (which did not post due to space constraints). pic.twitter.com\/z1Xi4nr2gq\u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 11, 2017  In the emails, Goldstone wrote to Trump Jr. that the information \"would be very useful to your father.\" Goldstone was working to connect Trump Jr. to Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, who later met with Trump Jr. in New York at Trump Tower. Veselnitskaya has denied that she ever worked for the Russian government and said on Tuesday that she doesn't represent the Russian government, only herself. She also said she \"couldn't have had\" information on Hillary Clinton. \"If it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer,\" Trump Jr. replied to Goldstone in one of a series of email exchanges the younger Trump posted to Twitter. The emails, dated early June, show Goldstone telling Trump that singer Emin Agalarov and his father, Moscow-based developer Aras Agalarov, had \"helped along\" the Russian government's support for Trump. The elder Agalarov was involved with Trump in hosting the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. The two men also had preliminary discussions about building a Trump Tower in Moscow that fell through. Trump also appeared in a music video with the younger Agalarov. Goldstone at one point said he could send the information to Trump's father first directly \"via Rhona,\" an apparent reference to the elder Trump's longtime assistant Rhona Graff. The email release followed days of evolving accounts from Trump Jr. about the nature of the meeting and its purpose. The president's son posted the emails only after they were obtained by The New York Times. On Saturday, Trump Jr. described the encounter as being a \"short introductory meeting\" focused on the disbanded program that had allowed American adoptions of Russian children. Moscow ended the adoptions in response to Magnitsky Act sanctions created in response to alleged human rights violations in Russia. A day later, Trump Jr. changed his account, acknowledging that he was told beforehand that Veselnitskaya might have information \"helpful\" to the Trump campaign, and was told by her during the meeting that she had something about Clinton. In his third description of what occurred, on Tuesday, Trump Jr. said he had believed the information he would hear about Clinton would be political opposition research. He said that he first wanted to speak by phone, but that when that didn't work out, he was told that the attorney would be in New York \"and I decided to take the meeting.\" \"The woman, as she has said publicly, was not a government official,\" Trump Jr. said in the Tuesday statement. \"And, as we have said, she had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act.\" The Trump Organization has confirmed the authenticity of Trump Jr. posts on Twitter releasing the email chain.

{"text":"Why James Damore Wants To Sue After Google FIRED Him For His Anti-Woman 'Manifesto' (And Who Just Offered Him A JOB): james damore google He claimed that women are not \"biologically\" suited for leadership positions. If you\u2019re not familiar with the name \u201cJames Damore,\u201d you probably haven\u2019t been on social media recently. If the name still doesn\u2019t ring a bell, perhaps you know him better by the headlines he\u2019s inspired \u2014 headlines like \u201cGoogle Employee's Anti-Diversity Manifesto Goes 'Internally Viral'\u201d or \u201cGoogle Fires Engineer Who Wrote Memo Questioning Women in Tech.\u201d The story was first reported on Vice\u2019s Motherboard site earlier this week \u2014 a software engineer, later revealed to be James Damore, posted a 10-page manifesto document to an internal discussion group for employees which criticized recent diversity hiring initiatives at Google, one of the biggest technology companies in the world. The memo argued that \u201cideological diversity\u201d was more important than gender diversity and that women are not as \u201cbiologically\u201d suited for work in technology or leadership positions. Perhaps predictably, many people at Google objected to the suggestion that female employees were biologically inferior to male employees, inspiring several of them to lambast Damore\u2019s arguments on social media and share the manifesto with news sites. You can read Damore\u2019s full document, titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber\u201d here, but the primary cause for the backlash against his memo stems from his argument that diversity hiring initiatives hurt men (rather than helping women). Here are some excerpts from his memo: \u2026 women relatively prefer jobs in social or artistic areas. \u2026 This leads to women generally having a harder time negotiating salary, asking for raises, speaking up, and leading. \u2026 humans are generally biased towards protecting females. \u2026 Once we acknowledge that not all differences are socially constructed or due to discrimination, we open our eyes to a more accurate view of the human condition which is necessary if we actually want to solve problems. \u2026 I\u2019m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don\u2019t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership. (Motherboard created an excellent breakdown of the sources that Damore cites in his argument, which you can read here.) Following the reveal of Damore\u2019s memo (and his identity), a number of things happened in quick succession: First, Danielle Brown, Google\u2019s Vice President of Diversity, Integrity and Governance, issued a statement, which criticized Damore\u2019s document for advancing \u201cincorrect assumptions about gender.\u201d She also stated that employees should \u201cfeel safe sharing their opinions. But that discourse needs to work alongside the principles of equal employment found in our Code of Conduct, policies, and anti-discrimination laws.\u201d Next, her statement was quickly followed by a company-wide email titled \u201cOur Words Matter\u201d from Google\u2019s chief executive officer, Sundar Pichai, who announced that Damore had been fired for violating the company\u2019s code of conduct and \u201cadvancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.\u201d The announcement of Damore\u2019s firing, however, swiftly became almost as divisive as the reaction to his original memo. Damore told various news outlet that he was considering legal action, telling The New York Times that, \u201cI have a legal right to express my concerns about the terms and conditions of my working environment and to bring up potentially illegal behavior, which is what my document does.\u201d While it remains unclear if Damore, as an at-will employee, did have the legal right to make his statements about gender without fear of repercussions from his employer \u2014 or how diversity programs can be seen as \u201cillegal behavior\u201d \u2014 his termination quickly turned the engineer into martyr figure for anti-censorship and alt-right groups online. Here are just a few of the subsequent tweets and Reddit posts, which have labeled Damore as a wrongly maligned hero \u2014 largely from people who agree with his views on diversity and gender. (Alternately, Gizmodo uncovered evidence that Damore took place in a \u201csexist\u201d skit during his time at Harvard University, which was considered offensive enough at the time that the administration issued a formal apology.) However, not all of Damore\u2019s support has been coming from Twitter and Reddit lurkers. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange tweeted support of Damore and offered him a job: Additionally, alt-right crowdfunding groups have begun raising money for Damore, the conservative National Review compared the engineer to Martin Luther, and several other pundits have claimed that Damore was fired for deviating \u201cfrom the talking points of the liberal left\" ( to quote Andrea Torba, CEO of Gab). The whole ugly incident is showing how divided we are, as a society, when it comes our opinions on gender and censorship.  Some outlets are arguing that all Damore did was \u201cpoint out the differences between men and women,\u201d but others claim that Damore\u2019s arguments aren\u2019t based on fact and are discriminatory in nature. (One wonders what the reaction would\u2019ve been if Damore argued that certain races \u2014 rather than genders \u2014 were more inclined to succeed in leadership and tech positions.) There definitely does not seem to be any scientific consensus backing the legitimacy of Damore\u2019s biological claims that women aren\u2019t suited for the tech industry (quite the contrary), so is posting specious theories about gender enough to justify his firing? Or does Google retain the right to fire any employee for any reason? Does a privately-owned company actually have to guarantee their employees the right to free speech on any topic, during company time, using company resources? One suspects these topics will be debated to death during any legal action Damore might bring against Google, but, in the meantime, his memo and his firing have ignited a social media firestorm about free speech and political correctness in the workplace.","label":1}
{"text":"Bombshell Report Reveals Up To 30% Of Federal Inmates Are Illegal Immigrants: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has released its findings on the immigration status of federal prison inmates, as mandated in a controversial Executive Order signed during the President Trump's first week in the White House. The report reveals that of the 37,557 confirmed immigrants in the federal prison system, 35,334 (94%) of them are in the United States illegally - which means out of a total of 185,507, federally incarcerated individuals, over 19% are confirmed illegal immigrants - which, in 2014, cost U.S. taxpayers $1.87 billion to house. It should be noted that the 19% figure is based on known illegals in federal prison - while 58,766 individuals are \"known or suspected\" to be illegal. If we apply the 94% confirmed illegal rate to the \"known or suspected\" population, it brings the total number of potential incarcerated illegal immigrants to 55,240 - or 30% of federal incarcerations.  (DHS Alien Incarceration Report , Q4 2017) The report also points out that the federal prison population is roughly 10%, with state and local facilities containing the vast majority of incarcerated individuals in the U.S. \"The American people deserve a lawful system of immigration that serves the national interest,\" said Attorney General Jeff Sessions, adding \"But at the border and in communities across America, our citizens are being victimized by illegal aliens who commit crimes. Nearly 95 percent of confirmed aliens in our federal prisons are here illegally. We know based on sentencing data that non-citizens commit a substantially disproportionate number of drug-related offenses, which contributes to our national drug abuse crisis. The simple fact is that any offense committed by a criminal alien is ultimately preventable.\" Immigrant rights groups predictably had a major problem with the report, claiming racism and manipulated data. \"The report proves one thing only: The administration will take any opportunity possible to twist facts to demonize immigrants,\" said Tom Jawetz, VP for immigration policy at the very liberal Center for American Progress, adding \"The vast majority of immigrants in federal prison are there for crimes that only immigrants can be charged with - illegal entry and illegal entry after removal. When you cook the books you shouldn't pretend to be surprised by the results.\"  The January 25th Executive Order, 13768; \"Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,\" was designed to use all available resources to deport incarcerated illegals and enforce existing immigration laws. The order states \"We cannot faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States if we exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to employ all lawful means to enforce the immigration laws of the United States.\" The order calls for the hire of 10,000 additional immigration officers, allows for issuing fines and penalties to unlawful aliens, allows State and local law enforcement agencies to act as immigration officers, and yanks Federal grant money from sanctuary cities - which was later reversed nationwide by a Chicago judge and ruled unconstitutional by Santa Clara County, CA judge William Orrick III. What wasn't killed by activist judges, however, was the Executive Order's mandate to provide quarterly reports on incarcerated immigrants. The EO reads:  To promote the transparency and situational awareness of criminal aliens in the United States, the Secretary and the Attorney General are hereby directed to collect relevant data and provide quarterly reports on the following: (a) the immigration status of all aliens incarcerated under the supervision of the Federal Bureau of Prisons; (b) the immigration status of all aliens incarcerated as Federal pretrial detainees under the supervision of the United States Marshals Service; and (c) the immigration status of all convicted aliens incarcerated in State prisons and local detention centers throughout the United States.  The Order also sets out enforcement actions, which \"shall prioritize for removal those aliens described by the Congress... ...removable aliens who:  (a) Have been convicted of any criminal offense; (b) Have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved; (c) Have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense; (d) Have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency; (e) Have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits; (f) Are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or (g) In the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.  One oustanding question now is what will a seemingly sleepwalking Jeff Sessions do about it? In May, Sessions announced the expansion and modernization of the Justice Department's Institutional Hearing Program, which is responsible for deportation hearings of incarcerated individuals. The measures are intended to fast-track the deportation of illegal immigrants convicted of crimes, which according to Sessions, will speed up the process by removing the criminal immigrant as soon as their sentence is complete - as opposed to sending them to another facility to await deportation. \"We owe it to the American people to ensure that illegal aliens who have been convicted of crimes and are serving time in our federal prisons are expeditiously removed from our country as the law requires,\" Sessions said in a statement. Sessions' May proposal established 14 federal prisons and six contract facilities for deportation proceedings, which the Attorney General says is a top priority going forward.","label":1}
{"text":"DOJ Opens Probe Into Bundy Prosecutors Who Hid Evidence: Authored by Tim Pearce via The Daily Caller, The Department of Justice (DOJ) has opened a probe into federal prosecutors of the recent trial of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, E ;E News reports.  Bundy faced criminal charges related to a 2014 standoff with Bureau of Land Management (BLM) agents. After the prosecutions numerous missteps and \u201cwillful\u201d withholding of evidence that would aid the Bundy\u2019s defense, the judge ruled a mistrial Wednesday, The Oregonian reports. The DOJ did not say whether it would pursue another trial against Cliven Bundy and others involved in the 2014 standoff, according to E ;E News. Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u201cpersonally directed that an expert in the department\u2019s discovery obligations be deployed to examine the case and advise as to next steps,\u201d DOJ deputy director of public affairs Ian Prior told The Oregonian. \u201cThis is every prosecutor\u2019s nightmare,\u201d retired federal prosecutor Kent Robinson said. Weeks before U.S. District Judge Gloria M. Navarro declared a mistrial of the case, a memo written by a BLM agent assigned to investigate the agency\u2019s actions during the 2014 raid on the Bundy ranch was released. The memo contained serious allegations of misconduct and likely illegal activities by BLM officials and prosecutors, led by acting Nevada U.S. Attorney Steven Myhre, throughout the raid and trial of Cliven Bundy. Throughout the trial, Myhre and his team of prosecutors were caught violating the Brady law six separate times for refusing to turn over exculpatory evidence that could help the Bundys. Myhre had removed the agent responsible for the memo, Larry Wooten, from his position investigating the BLM in February, confiscating all his records and data. Wooten wrote his 18 page memo from memory and leaked it the DOJ.","label":1}
{"text":"Wife Of Fusion GPS Founder Admits Her Husband Was Behind Fake &quot;RussiaGate&quot; Story: The Russiagate story concocted by Hillary Clinton and the DNC, who coincidently funded Fusion GPS (the firm behind the \u2018Trump dossier\u2019 that the entire Russia election meddling is based upon), is unraveling at record speed.  Mary Jacoby, the wife of Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, who is the man in the middle of the entire Russiagate scandal, boasted on Facebook about how \u2018Russiagate,\u2019 would not exist if it weren\u2019t for her husband. Tablet Magazine reports\u2026  A Tablet investigation using public sources to trace the evolution of the now-famous dossier suggests that central elements of the Russiagate scandal emerged not from the British ex-spy Christopher Steele\u2019s top-secret \u201csources\u201d in the Russian government\u2014which are unlikely to exist separate from Russian government control\u2014but from a series of stories that Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson and his wife Mary Jacoby co-wrote for TheWall Street Journal well before Fusion GPS existed, and Donald Trump was simply another loud-mouthed Manhattan real estate millionaire. Understanding the origins of the \u201cSteele dossier\u201d is especially important because of what it tells us about the nature and the workings of what its supporters would hopefully describe as an ongoing campaign to remove the elected president of the United States. ... In a Facebook post from June 24, 2017, that Tablet has seen in screenshots, Jacoby claimed that her husband deserves the lion\u2019s share of credit for Russiagate. (She has not replied to repeated requests for comment.) \u201cIt\u2019s come to my attention that some people still don\u2019t realize what Glenn\u2019s role was in exposing Putin\u2019s control of Donald Trump,\u201d Jacoby wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear. Glenn conducted the investigation. Glenn hired Chris Steele. Chris Steele worked for Glenn.\u201d This assertion is hardly a simple assertion of family pride; it goes directly to the nature of what became known as the \u201cSteele dossier,\u201d on which the Russiagate narrative is founded.  The Gateway Pundit reports that the news of the Facebook post comes amid heightened scrutiny for the opposition research firm. According to Fox News reporter Jake Gibson, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has called on a senior Justice Department attorney to look into appointing a special counsel to investigate recently demoted official Bruce Ohr\u2019s contacts with Fusion GPS.  \u201cSessions on calls for a special counsel to look into Sr DOJ Official Bruce Ohr, and wife Nellie\u2019s contacts with Fusion GPS during the summer and fall of 2016: I\u2019ve put a Senior Attorney, with the resources he may need, to review cases in our office and make a recommendation to me, if things aren\u2019t being pursued that need to be pursued, if cases may need more resources to complete in a proper manner, and to recommend to me if the standards for a special counsel are met, and the recommended one should be established,\u201d tweeted Fox News reporter Jake Gibson on Tuesday. Fox News\u2018 James Rosen and Jake Gibson recently reported the wife of Justice Department official Bruce G. Ohr worked for the opposition research firm during the 2016 presidential election.  Fox News reports\u2026  Contacted by Fox News, investigators for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) confirmed that Nellie H. Ohr, wife of the demoted official, Bruce G. Ohr, worked for the opposition research firm last year. The precise nature of Mrs. Ohr\u2019s duties \u2013 including whether she worked on the dossier \u2013 remains unclear but a review of her published works available online reveals Mrs. Ohr has written extensively on Russia-related subjects. HPSCI staff confirmed to Fox News that she was paid by Fusion GPS through the summer and fall of 2016.  In a statement to Fox News, a Justice Department spokesperson noted that\u2026  \u201cIt is unusual for anyone to wear two hats as he has done recently. This person is going to go back to a single focus - director of our organized crime and drug enforcement unit. As you know, combatting transnational criminal organizations and drug trafficking is a top priority for the Attorney General.\u201d ","label":1}
{"text":"How Trump Has Influenced Prevention Of Harriet Tubman\u2019s Image On $20 Bill: The bill to place Harriet Tubman\u2019s face on the $20 is apparently in limbo. Steven Mnuchin, Treasury Secretary; recently said that he wouldn\u2019t commit to executing the Obama administration\u2019s agenda to feature Harriet Tubman\u2019s image on the $20 bill. He claimed that he hadn\u2019t yet decided on a cause of action on the matter. Mnuchin added that the decision would be more focused on how to design the $20 currency in a manner that prevents counterfeiting, than whose image is on the bill. \u201cEventually we will be looking into this issue,\u201d Mnuchin stated. \u201cIt isn\u2019t something I am focused on currently.\u201d Mnuchin went saying \u201cthe issues of why we should change it will be mainly related to what we have to do for the security reasons.\u201d Last year, President Barack Obama and Jacob Lew, the Treasury Secretary of that time\u2014proposed to take the image of President Andrew Jackson off the $20 bill and then replace it with that of Harriet Tubman. Tubman is a famous abolitionist who assisted many enslaved people to escape. If everything goes as planned; Tubman would be the first Black-American and the first female to appear on U.S. currency, in more than a century. (Martha Washington was featured on silver certificates back in the late 19th century.) Lew\u2019s plan explained that Tubman\u2019s image would be placed on the front side of the $20 bill. And then that of Jackson would appear on the opposite of the currency. The America\u2019s treasury department had earlier made an announcement that seemed to convince that they were ready to put Harriet Tubman portrait on the front of the $20 currency. However, President Donald Trump has made it clear that he is very fond of Jackson. He said it at times when he was remarking that his election was reminiscent of the populist campaign of 1829 that ascended Jackson into power. Trump even has an image of Jackson on the wall\u2014in the Oval Office. In the last year interview with NBC, President Trump said that although Tubman was \u201cfantastic,\u201d putting her on the $20 currency was exemplifying \u201cpure political incorrectness.\u201d \u201cWell. Andrew Jackson had an incredible history, and I think it is very harsh when you take somebody one off, the bill,\u201d said Trump. \u201cI think Tubman is fantastic as well, but I would love us to leave Andrew Jackson or figure out if we can maybe find another denomination.\u201d Read the original story here","label":1}
{"text":"Report: Samantha Power made 260 requests last year to \u201cunmask\u201d Americans in intel reports: That\u2019s \u2026 a lotta unmasking. The fact that Samantha Power is at the heart of the \u201cunmasking\u201d investigation in the House barely qualifies as news at this point, as her name has been floating around in connection with it for months. In fact, Trey Gowdy quizzed John Brennan about a mysterious ambassador and her strange unmasking requests at a House hearing all the way back on May 23. By mid-July the Free Beacon\u2019s sources had identified her as a \u201ccentral figure\u201d in the probe. Note this quote from that piece:  \u201cUnmasking is not a regular occurrence\u2014absolutely not a weekly habit. It is rare, even at the National Security Council, and ought to be rarer still for a U.N. ambassador,\u201d according to one former senior U.S. official who spoke to the Washington Free Beacon.  Well, it wasn\u2019t a weekly habit for Power, if Fox\u2019s sources are to be believed. It was a daily habit:  Wait... now Cohen is offering a guilty plea?  Samantha Power, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was \u2018unmasking\u2019 at such a rapid pace in the final months of the Obama administration that she averaged more than one request for every working day in 2016 \u2013 and even sought information in the days leading up to President Trump\u2019s inauguration, multiple sources close to the matter told Fox News. Two sources, who were not authorized to speak on the record, said the requests to identify Americans whose names surfaced in foreign intelligence reporting, known as unmasking, exceeded 260 last year. One source indicated this occurred in the final days of the Obama White House.  When asked for comment, Power\u2019s spokesman noted that she wasn\u2019t just the ambassador to the UN, she was a member of the National Security Council. But so what? Note again what the senior official told the Free Beacon \u2014 even at the NSC, unmasking is rare. The Council also includes the head of OMB and the head of the National Economic Council, incidentally. Should Mick Mulvaney and Gary Cohn be unmasking American citizens in intelligence reports at will just because they\u2019re members? Here\u2019s an easy way to gauge whether Power\u2019s practices were appropriate: How did her volume of unmasking requests stack up to Susan Rice\u2019s and John Brennan\u2019s? Rice was national security advisor, Brennan was head of the CIA. If anyone in the Obama administration had reason to be unmasking U.S. citizens for valid intelligence purposes, it was them. You\u2019d certainly expect Brennan to have made more unmasking requests than someone more peripheral to the intelligence process, like Power. So let\u2019s know the numbers. How many unmasking requests per week on average were Rice and Brennan filing compared to her? Another question: How many of Power\u2019s requests were actually granted? An official can ask to have the redacted name of an American in an intelligence report revealed but it\u2019s up to the FBI and NSA to grant that request. And they don\u2019t do it lightly, as Fox notes:  \u201cWe [the NSA] apply two criteria in response to their request: number one, you must make the request in writing. Number two, the request must be made on the basis of your official duties, not the fact that you just find this report really interesting and you\u2019re just curious,\u201d [Mike Rogers] said in June. \u201cIt has to tie to your job and finally, I said two but there\u2019s a third criteria, and is the basis of the request must be that you need this identity to understand the intelligence you\u2019re reading.\u201d  What was a UN ambassador doing in her \u201cofficial duties\u201d that required her to know the identities of so many Americans who turned up in intelligence reports? If it turns out she did in fact \u201cjust find this report really interesting\u201d and was \u201cjust curious\u201d and the NSA or FBI *granted* unmasking requests made along those lines then this scandal will blow up far beyond Power herself. A lone official trying to go rogue on intelligence by making a ridiculous number of unmasking requests is one thing. The FBI and NSA abetting her by granting those requests and outing Americans to someone who may have had no legitimate intelligence purpose in knowing who they are is another thing entirely. *If* that\u2019s what happened here, Comey and Rogers will become the center of the probe, not Power. Why were their agencies not more exacting in demanding proper justification for unmasking, investigators will wonder, particularly given the alarming number of requests from Power and the fact that her job didn\u2019t obviously require her to have this information? One point in Power\u2019s defense, though. What are the odds that she would be allowed to go on making hundreds of improper unmasking requests without it leaking and with no one stopping her? If the FBI and NSA were rejecting her applications daily, you would think someone would have stepped in at some point and either told her to cool it or whispered to the papers that she was abusing the process. And if the FBI and NSA were granting most of her applications, it\u2019s hard to believe they were so systematically crooked that they would risk their institutional reputations and a major scandal to rubber-stamp requests made by a figure as tangential to the natsec process as Power. This wasn\u2019t Brennan or James Clapper demanding the information, it was a diplomat who spent most of her tenure impotently defending Obama\u2019s impotent Syria policy. Would Comey and Rogers gamble their careers by looking the other way at improper applications made by her for months on end? Maybe Power had reason to suspect there were Americans working at the UN, maybe even on her own staff, who were quietly double-dealing with foreign powers in the building? That would be a legitimate intelligence purpose for unmasking, but why the UN ambassador would be left to make those requests instead of Brennan or Rice, I have no idea. American double agents at the UN would be a big deal, worthy of attention from the big cheeses of natsec.","label":1}
{"text":"Sadly the NY Times is back to questioning the value of free speech: One month ago I wrote a post giving the NY Times credit for publishing a solid defense of free speech. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see the paper publish something that defends free speech as a blessing rather than a problem that needs to be solved,\u201d I said. Today, I\u2019m sorry to say, the NY Times has slipped back into quite literally questioning the value of free speech. An op-ed by Professor Aaron Hanlon suggests speeches by conservatives have become too costly to police and should probably be reconsidered on a cost-benefit basis. That would be bad enough but Hanlon also downplays and excuses the reasons for those excessive costs, i.e. violent, far left protesters like Antifa.  Wait... now Cohen is offering a guilty plea?  In a typical year, the University of California, Berkeley, allocates around $200,000 to pay for security at campus protests. But since this past February, the school has spent some $1.5 million. That enormous sum excludes the $1 million the administration expected to spend this week on Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019s chaotic and disorganized \u201cFree Speech Week.\u201d\u2026 And it raises a thorny question for those who believe that free speech should trump all else: Should public institutions be spending taxpayer money allocated for higher education on speakers who aren\u2019t there for teaching and learning?  Hanlon is correct that an absurd amount of money is being spent on security, though it\u2019s worth noting that a recent audit showed there were other financial problems within the UC system that go well beyond the money spent on protecting conservative speakers. In any case, I think most people on the right and left would agree this is not an ideal situation. The question is this: Why is so much spending necessary? And here, Hanlon completely whiffs on the answer:  Undoubtedly, left-wing \u201cantifa\u201d groups have contributed to the security risks and costs at Berkeley, taking the bait that speakers like Mr. Yiannopoulos lay out and battling far-right militia groups who show up looking for a fight. But we should keep in mind, as the historian Mark Bray points out, that antifa groups form specifically to counter white supremacist and Nazi violence, having done so from the days of Hitler and Mussolini. Antifa groups are a symptom, not a cause, of the threat of white supremacist violence.  To say that Antifa has \u201ccontributed\u201d to costs at Berkeley could be the understatement of the year. When Antifa shut down a previous speech by Yiannopoulos in February members of the group beat several people and did $100,000 in property damage. That doesn\u2019t include the damage done to the school\u2019s reputation as the home of the free speech movement. And that\u2019s a pittance compared to the $1 million in damage Antifa did in Portland this year. Political violence is costly. When Ben Shapiro came to Berkeley earlier this month, the school felt it necessary to close the balcony of the theater where he was speaking (lest Antifa kill someone), shut down 7 nearby buildings, set up concrete barriers and spend $600,000 to keep the event safe. As I pointed out here, local banks closed early and boarded up windows. Does Professor Hanlon think they were worried about zealous capitalists trying to withdraw too much money? The bland reference to \u201chistorian Mark Bray\u201d suggests Hanlon isn\u2019t being remotely honest with his audience. Bray isn\u2019t just a historian \u2013 he\u2019s a far left former Occupy spokesman who is now the single most prominent defender of Antifa\u2019s violence in the public sphere. Maybe that\u2019s worth mentioning when using him as an expert on Antifa. But the most offensive thing here is the idea that Antifa is merely a \u201csymptom.\u201d This is an attempt to get violent kooks off the hook for their own inexcusable behavior. Hanlon does this by bringing up the historical reaction to the Nazis. But do Nazis explain the surge of Antifa violence that took place in Germany this summer or, for that matter, in Washington in January? You almost get the impression Antifa doesn\u2019t need much of an excuse to get violent. Getting back to Berkeley, the amount of money spent to keep speakers safe is a proportionate response to the threat of left-wing violence. How do we know? Because in its response to a lawsuit brought against the school by the college Republicans this is the exact argument Berkeley made [emphasis added]:  The email explained that UCPD had, based on a \u201ccomprehensive review of potential sites and security arrangements,\u201d \u201cdetermined that, given currently active security threats, it is not possible to assure that the event could be held successfully\u2014or that the safety of Ms. Coulter, the event sponsors, audience, and bystanders could be adequately protected\u2014at any of the campus venues available on April 27th.\u201d\u2026 Plaintiffs contend that Defendants enforced the \u201cunwritten, High-Profile Speaker Policy against YAF and BCR,\u201d while allowing Vicente Fox Quesada, the former president of Mexico, to speak on campus at 4:00 p.m. on April 17, 2017, and Maria Echaveste to speak on campus from 6:45 to 8:00 p.m. \u201cwithout incident or interference from Defendants.\u201d (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 78-79, 91.) Plaintiffs do not allege any threats to security accompanying the speeches of Mr. Fox or Ms. Echaveste.  In other words, there weren\u2019t any right-wing mobs looking to shut down or shout down left-wing speakers. There were credible threats (and recent history) of mob action by the left against right-wing speakers. This is what you call a clue! Professor Hanlon seems to have missed it. Finally, the suggestion that Hanlon makes that Ben Shapiro is somehow a representative of the threat of white supremacist violence is absurd. He is a Jewish conservative who has been a frequent (in fact, the most frequent) target of alt-right anger over the past year. And yet, there were credible threats he would be shut down if not for the extensive preparations by law enforcement. The cost of protecting conservative speakers on campus is far too high, while the cost of protecting progressive speakers is minimal. The solution to this problem is not to suggest schools should give up trying but to demand that the people making the threats stop making them. It\u2019s a shame so many contributors to the NY Times can\u2019t seem to get that.","label":1}

{"text":"\u201cOutraged Democrats\u201d don\u2019t even wait 8 hours before calling for more gun control: Well, this was sadly predictable, even when the day started with a lot of people calling on their fellow citizens to not jump into politicizing the Las Vegas shooting while the injured were still being tended to. NBC News is reporting that some of the usual list of Democratic suspects have taken advantage of this tragedy to immediately call for new gun control laws.  The worst mass shooting in modern American history was met with immediate calls for action on gun control Monday from some Democratic lawmakers. While most of their colleagues on both sides of the aisle stuck to sending condolences to victims and their families in the Las Vegas shooting, Connecticut\u2019s senators expressed outrage that Congress has not done more to restrict access to deadly firearms five years after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown. \u201cNowhere but America do horrific large-scale mass shootings happen with this degree of regularity,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said in a statement. \u201cThis must stop,\u201d Murphy continued. \u201cIt is positively infuriating that my colleagues in Congress are so afraid of the gun industry that they pretend there aren\u2019t public policy responses to this epidemic. There are, and the thoughts and prayers of politicians are cruelly hollow if they are paired with continued legislative indifference. It\u2019s time for Congress to get off its ass and do something.\u201d  Murphy was joined by his Connecticut partners, Senator Richard Blumenthal and Congressman Jim Himes. Hillary Clinton, Michael Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren quickly got in on the act as well.  Wait... now Cohen is offering a guilty plea? Okay, then. Fine. Since we apparently have to go through this exercise every time there\u2019s a tragedy, let\u2019s talk about it. Right out of the gate I would ask these Democrats the same questions we need to wrestle with after every shooting. First of all, what went wrong in this instance and what specific laws would you like to suggest which might have prevented it and will hopefully prevent something like this from happening again in the future? Thus far we don\u2019t have much in the way of rock solid details as to what weapons the shooter used. Allahpundit laid out pretty much all the possibilities in an earlier post and the raw laws of physics dictated that it was going to wind up being one of those options or possibly a combination of a couple. More details are leaking out and it now sounds as if there were, in fact, one or more fully automatic weapons along with a bunch of semiautomatics, but the police aren\u2019t providing an exhaustive list. Let\u2019s go on the assumption that we won\u2019t know for sure for a while and move forward from there. The path leading us to how the shooter and the firearms wound up in that hotel room should be able to guide you in your answers for what sort of new gun control laws you\u2019d like us to consider. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s the most obvious choice based on the sounds we heard in the many witness videos\u2026 one or more fully automatic machine guns of some sort. If that\u2019s the case, the shooter either purchased it legally prior to 1986 or he obtained it illegally by stealing it or buying it on the black market. If the former, then he passed one of the most rigorous federal background checks imaginable and was already on the radar of the FBI just for owning the weapon or weapons. He was also pretty well off since they would have cost him upwards of $10K each. (Though he had two really nice cars, so maybe he could afford it.) That means that someone who passed those most brutal of background checks went off the rails, became insane or developed some other issues later in life. What law would you propose to prevent that? Perhaps he stole them or bought them on the black market. Then no amount of background checks in the world would have stopped this because people dealing in illegal weapons don\u2019t do background checks. Perhaps, as Allahpundit speculated, he had a brace of ten or more AR-15 style semiautomatics which he modified. Well, modifying them in that fashion is illegal already. If you\u2019d like to suggest tougher penalties for people who do that, I suppose I can get onboard with the idea, but somehow it doesn\u2019t seem like it would have stopped this guy. If your solution is to once again ask to ban all of the millions of legal owners of semiautomatic rifles from owning them in response to someone who broke the law by modifying them you\u2019re not solving a problem, you\u2019re creating a bigger one. Beyond that what would you suggest? Smaller magazine capacities? (Nevada doesn\u2019t have a very restrictive limit.) The guy had ten or more rifles lined up by the window. And anyone with a day or so of practice can swap out a magazine in under three seconds. You might have slowed him down a fraction, but not much. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve come up with. So, dear Outraged Democrats, let me know if you\u2019ve thought of something else. If your plan is to simply repeal the Second Amendment, bring that fight on. But I do have one actual solution you never seem to want to talk about. If, as it\u2019s not unreasonable to suspect, the shooter got his guns illegally, why don\u2019t you consider new or enhanced laws and more resources to crack down on the illegal gun market? Rather than chasing around and harassing the hundreds of millions of legal gun owners who don\u2019t commit acts of violence, unleash the power of the legislature and law enforcement on improved ways to get illegal guns off the streets and lock up the people using or dealing in them for longer periods of time. Gee\u2026 what a novel idea, eh?","label":1}
{"text":"Justice Department jamming shut the revolving door for illegal aliens: One of the running complaints raised against opponents of border security is the proliferation of criminal illegal aliens who enter the United States repeatedly, are apprehended and then sent back to their home countries. That part of the formula would be fine were it not for the fact that so many of them keep crossing the border multiple times, only to be found committing additional crimes. In some of the worst cases, you wind up with a result along the lines of the murder of Kate Steinle. But less high profile situations clog the system on a regular basis. This year that destructive pattern has finally begun to change, albeit slowly. With new laws on the books and a more aggressive Attorney General, prosecutions are on the rise and sentences are at least somewhat more appropriate for the perpetrators. One such case came through this week in Louisiana, where Juan Carlos Rigoberto-Martinez had been caught in the country illegally multiple times after committing multiple crimes. The citizen of Honduras encountered a different sort of reception this time and found himself in federal court where he was summarily sent up the river for more than a decade. (Justice.gov)  Wait... now Cohen is offering a guilty plea?  BATON ROUGE, LA \u2013 Acting United States Attorney Corey Amundson announced that yesterday U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles sentenced JUAN CARLOS RIGOBERTO-MARTINEZ, age 33, of Honduras, to serve 130 months in federal prison for illegally reentering the United States after removal. The defendant\u2019s extensive criminal history, including his status as an aggravated felon, contributed significantly to the lengthy sentence. Yesterday\u2019s sentence stems from the defendant\u2019s federal conviction on April 12, 2017, for illegally reentering the United States after removal. Immigration authorities first removed the defendant from the United States on January 7, 2008, after he completed a state prison sentence in Georgia for burglary and theft. Several months later, on June 5, 2008, the U.S. Border Patrol found and arrested the defendant in Texas for illegally reentering the United States after removal. The defendant plead guilty to the offense, resulting in a 77-month federal prison sentence from the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. On December 27, 2013, immigration authorities again removed the defendant from the United States following the completion of his prison term.  This is an encouraging development which will hopefully send a strong message to the illegal alien community. Too often in the past we\u2019ve seen illegals who have been deported as many as seven times being brought in on charges and we essentially focus on the new crimes they have committed. If those are sufficiently \u201cminor\u201d in nature they are frequently given yet another free ride back to their homeland and the cycle begins anew. Not so with Rigoberto-Martinez. He had done a short stretch in prison in Georgia for burglary in 2008 when he was deported back to Honduras. In a matter of months he was back in the United States illegally once again. This time he was arrested for multiple robberies in Baton Rouge. He was already found guilty on those counts, but this time there was a difference. In a separate trial, he was found guilty exclusively of reentering the country illegally after having been deported as a criminal illegal alien. That was the charge he was sent up on rather than the robberies. (For which he will serve a shorter, concurrent sentence.) Even if all Rigoberto-Martinez had been convicted of was petty theft of a pack of gum at a convenience store, he could have been locked away for a good, long stretch for illegal reentry. It\u2019s obvious that our prison system doesn\u2019t need to be further strained with a deluge of these criminals, but the less welcoming of a place we make America for criminal illegal aliens, the lower the incentive will be to jump the fence and come here. The sentencing of Rigoberto-Martinez goes at least some way towards driving that message home among the illegal alien community. Now if we can just make the E-Verify system mandatory across the board to decrease the incentive for illegal aliens looking to take paying jobs rather than stick-up jobs we might really have something going. But don\u2019t get your hopes up, since that would involve Congress actually doing their jobs.","label":1}
{"text":"Law prof: There\u2019s still a way Hillary Clinton could become president this year, you know: On the one hand, I want to mock this as preposterous fanfic coughed up by a \u201cResistance\u201d movement that still hasn\u2019t managed to choke down the fact of Trump\u2019s victory. On the other hand, everyone\u2019s entitled to their own taste in porn. For some lefties, a constitutional deus ex machina in which the queen is magically restored to her rightful throne is it.  Wait... now Cohen is offering a guilty plea? The law prof behind this, Lawrence Lessig, also claimed last December that 20 Republican members of the electoral college were considering voting against Trump. In the end, Trump lost two. Hillary Clinton lost more Democratic electors than that. And now here we are. As summarized by Newsweek:  If number 1: If Trump is definitively found to have colluded directly with Russia, he would be forced to resign or be impeached. If number 2: If Trump is removed, Vice President Mike Pence would become president. If number 3: If Pence becomes president, he should resign too, given that he benefited from the same help from Mother Russia. If number 4: If Pence resigns before appointing a vice president, Ryan would become president. If number 5: If Ryan becomes president, he should do the right thing and choose Clinton for vice president. Then he should resign.  Actually, there\u2019s a sixth step in Lessig\u2019s piece: In a gesture of goodwill, President Hillary should then appoint Ryan (or some other Republican) as her VP. Imagine the Clinton\/Ryan ticket trying to work through disagreements on, say, entitlements and federal spending. Jay Cost made a good point about this last night. Even if you\u2019ve convinced yourself that there\u2019s a chance in hell of Trump *and* Pence both being removed by the Senate due to collusion with Russia, why would you seize on some convoluted \u201cRyan names Hillary VP and then resigns\u201d fantasy to get her into the Oval Office? There\u2019s a much more straightforward way: Step one: Democrats win back the House, which isn\u2019t at all unlikely right now. Step two: Democrats name Hillary Clinton the new Speaker. Pelosi won\u2019t like that, but whatever. The Speaker doesn\u2019t need to be a member of the House. Step three: The House impeaches Trump and Pence. Step four: The Senate removes Trump and Pence, clearing the way for \u2014 ta da \u2014 Speaker Clinton to become president via established rules of succession. That fourth step\u2019s a doozy, though, huh? Due to the fact that the most vulnerable senators up for reelection next fall are almost all Democrats, even the most optimistic Dems think the best-case scenario in the midterms is winning a *bare* majority in the Senate. That would require holding all vulnerable Democratic seats, knocking off Dean Heller and Jeff Flake, and then pulling a major red-state upset somewhere. Do all that \u2014 an inside straight electorally \u2014 and you\u2019ve got 51. In which case Schumer would still need no fewer than 16 Republicans to vote for removing Trump (and Pence). Unless Mueller produces video of Putin handing Trump a fat envelope, he\u2019ll never get it. And even then, half the party would argue that we can\u2019t know exactly what was in the envelope. Maybe it was a Hallmark card offering the United States a reset. I have no big ending to this post, so in lieu of an exit question, enjoy Rand Paul dumping all over John McCain and Lindsey Graham.

{"text":"Made in America: Buy or Not to Buy?: Ask about your products, become more involved. Are you ok with supporting sweatshop labor? Are you ok with knowing your cheaper product made somewhere else could be causing suffering to another family? Are we killing our jobs, economy, and business? Importing from Another Country or Buying the Material In American? Over my lifetime, I have continually heard my family and friends complain \"everything is made in China.\" In many ways, until I started working and understood just how some businesses work, I had no clue about how imports could undercut prices in this country. Most everyone usually has a problem with this concept; China manufacturers in massive numbers whereas, America produces only smaller and more accurate parts and products. Furthermore, the mass production allows for decreased prices. Think of every single product you have purchased in the last few months, look at the back or wherever the label is and find the origin. Chances are, your parts and products have not been manufactured in the same country. Instead, a variety of supplies will be imported from different locations then shipped into a plant to finish production. For example, the new administration put forth \"buy American, hire American\" to help existing businesses and start up businesses produce and distribute these within their local and even national community. Many times, even products and parts claiming to be made in America have been found to be nothing but a fraud, they purchase the steel, ingredients, etc. in America but then, ship these things to another country to be put together or made and then sent back to this country. For example, I use to work for Highland Industries, Inc in Kernersville, NC a few years back, they manufactured the raw rubber for Nascar, GM, Ford, Nissan and so on as well as the seat belt division located in another state. I drove a forklift and kept an inventory duel role. We made the rubber at the plant, hired a trucking company to come from Laredo, Texas to drive all the way to NC to pick up a load and then drive back and enter Mexico to get the rubber put on the tires as well as the seat belt material was cut and sewn. This material was then shipped back to the states to be sold to the auto industry\/parts to them or to the customers. Digging a Little Deeper Now, we must consider what brings up the current \"buy American\" has lost its value since NAFTA took effect; manufacturing virtually went away during this unfair exchange of labor and allowing basically slave labor\/sweatshops to cut jobs primarily hurting everyone in the process. Why does it hurt cheaper labor\/sweatshops? Consider the situation. While we may receive lower prices overall and the business usually makes a significant profit, the ones doing the work are not getting a fair wage and often are put in adverse working conditions and extremely long working hours. So, it must be better actually to buy American right? The answer may surprise you. Currently, my wife and I own a small business making whole body products such as soaps, shampoos, laundry detergent, etc.mostly, our products are mostly made in America. What does that necessarily equate to? Here's the answer, we purchase our bases, the blocks of material that we cut off smaller portions, weigh them, melt it and put it into a pour spout cup, mix up the fragrances and put them into 8, 16, 32 oz bottles of shampoo, deodorant bottles or soap molds. We can purchase the bases from other American owned companies cheaper here, the fragrances here, most shipping supplies but believe it or not, Ali Express in China can produce better and more inexpensive bottles, lids and some other products because, in America, these items are generally one to two dollars more expensive. These companies once they are called and asked where they are getting their bulk supplies usually tell you they get them overseas and usually end the conversation. In most of my phone calls initially, when the company started up, most of these wholesalers told me they got them from Ali Express. This usually ends up cutting out the \"middle man\" as it were and if you are a business, you can contact this company and purchase directly and save a lot of money. Do People Practice What They Preach? Often we now hear about buying local, I have found out that many of these same people that make a claim, will not buy local but will rather go online and purchase from Amazon or some major retailer for a lower price and even pay more for shipping than driving to the brick and mortar store. As a small business owner, I can fully understand the need to save money and do other things with it, but at the same time, our country cannot continue to keep on with the mentality that our products are worth a lot more than they are. American's can and should make our parts and products again to bring down prices, the only reason things cost more money for our country and businesses is that companies pay out larger portions of labor fees to their employees. The mentality that we all must have a 15 dollar and an hour wage will drive prices through the roof and put these same people demanding the pay out of work or cut down considerably. We must, as a country, require our manufacturing start producing and take back the products that are currently being made in China but people demand low prices on every product regardless of what the part or product is. This mentality coupled with the \"entitled\" generation will cause great problems in these areas, children growing up think they have the right to an education, excellent wages for minimum skills and countless other things. They are being told that we shouldn't be making our products and mock most people doing things for themselves such as the business that my wife and I produce in our spare time. I cannot stand the fact that I must purchase from China on my product bottles, deodorant, and even chapstick tubes to save money and hopefully start employing people. If another company in America would produce the same products at the same price or barely a little more expensive, I would switch. Still, to continue having a competitive edge, something has to give. Maybe I have given others something to think about but just remember, before NAFTA was put in place, we produced most of our furniture but sadly has dwindled to almost nothing now. My mother worked at the Basset Furniture in Mt. Airy, NC for nearly 20 years putting in runners in drawers before things started going away. To continue surviving in our country again, we must all demand and purchase actually companies that are mostly\/are made in America to bring back our economy and support ourselves\/friends. This may sound a little political, but it\u2019s the truth, you cannot demand to buy local when you don't actually buy local, to begin with, and demand the company lose money to sell it to you cheaper. My advice, find America owned companies, ask them if they make their products here, and should they confirm this, remember just because it's more reasonable from somewhere else does not mean it is made well. Quantity and quality are two different spheres. Some products such as the Apple iPhone and others are manufactured in another country produced by sweatshop workers that live in dangerous working conditions and terrible wages.It's time to start thinking more about the product and what it supports than that lower price, did you know that Appreciate the Importance of Cruelty Free Another important aspect to consider when delving into the shopping and purchasing products involves the meaning of \"Cruelty-Free.\" For many years, America prohibited the practices of animal testing. In fact, many believe this to be a standard in American production and manufacturing still. What few realize is the time limit placed on animal experiments has expired. Now, many companies, especially within the makeup industry, have once again returned to this horrible practice. For example: Avon. Benefit.Clinique. CoverGirl.Est\u00e9e Lauder. L'Or\u00e9al. Makeup Forever, and Maybelline. Do all test their products on animals? Please look up these companies and do more than getting angry about it or if you don't know, then you need to, buying these products don't help Americans and kill, and injured animals every year. The challenge is recognizing how we all either can support and begin to make personal changes to impact the direction of the safety of our products. It also reminds us to identify the need to accept responsibility by how our decisions may affect not only others but also animals as well. Move forward with purpose! Learn to Ask Questions Call companies and ask where they get their ingredients\/parts from Ask do they make the product\/food whatever in America Look around locally and inspect whatever you purchase for origins Questions are not bad!

{"text":"Tooth Regeneration Must Prevail!: A. Introduction Science and technology are both evolving rapidly. Often they are both evolving so rapidly that even the savviest people have a difficult time keeping abreast of all the latest developments in each area of science and technology. Not too long ago, my sister had a conversation with me about computer technology, and she made the point that a computer that you buy from a store becomes obsolete by the time that you remove it from its box and get it running. Nevertheless, certain items continue to remain in existence despite that one would think that they would be obsolete by now, and usually it is because of popular demand. Take the example of the manual typewriter. Authors all have their own preferences on how they wish to compose their literary works. When I was watching the movie titled The Magic of Belle Isle in which Morgan Freeman played the role of an author, there was a scene in that movie in which he stressed that he preferred a manual typewriter because of the feeling that he got from using it. He added that he also liked the sound of it. Interestingly enough, nobody ever has to go on a wild goose chase to find a replacement part for a typewriter, manual or electric, whenever it is on the fritz and they have to take it somewhere to get it fixed. On the other hand, authors who use computers are always confronted with the dreaded fate of their computer running into software and hardware problems after replacement parts that they later need for it have stopped being manufactured. Certain photographers will stress that pictures just don\u2019t look natural unless they are taken with a camera that uses real film rather than digital technology. I remember back in the 1990s right after I had been in the Northridge earthquake out in California, I became concerned about whether my records had been damaged. However, when I asked all my relatives nearby if I could use their record players to check them for scratches, they told me that they were out of order and that they didn\u2019t know where I could buy one either. Unfortunately, I did not own a record player at the time. When I had initially bought these records, I had used my parents\u2019 record player to play them. However, because my parents were living clear back on the East Coast, I no longer had that option after I had moved out to California. Anyhow, I phoned just about every store in West Los Angeles and Santa Monica that I could think of to ask whether they sold record players, and they all told me that they no longer did so inasmuch as everyone was buying CDs by then and almost nobody was selling regular vinyl records. Ironically, not too many years later, record players began appearing in sales magazines that I received in the mail, and eventually regular stores began selling them again because of the popular demand for them. Then, shortly thereafter, vinyl records began making a comeback to the market. By the way, I eventually checked my records for scratches after I was eventually able to buy a record player of my own that allowed me to listen to them, and it turned out that the earthquake had not damaged them in any manner. Manual typewriters, regular camera film, vinyl records, and record players all four have become such a regular part of American pop culture that not even the rapid evolution of science and technology will ever completely phase them out. Americans have grown too attached to these items, because they have a certain charm about them. On the other hand, whenever anyone hears the mention of dentures or any kind of prosthetic teeth, angry faces appear everywhere. The fact of the matter is that most people hate the idea of having such phony baloney materials in their mouth at all times. Most people feel that dentures and false teeth are completely below them, because they are unattractive and they are often associated with getting old. Then again, most elderly individuals would prefer to have their own natural teeth than a mouth full of false teeth. Dentures and false teeth are just not really anybody\u2019s cup of tea. They\u2019re expensive, and they\u2019re a pain in the neck to have in your mouth. Dental implants may seem closer in appearance to natural teeth, but they are still expensive and they involve a certain degree of unwanted risks. Fillings, crowns, caps, and bridges may not get as many dirty looks from the public at large, but the high costs of having them placed in your mouth still makes them not so popular. Then many of us ask ourselves why do these abominations of dentistry continue to exist if computer technology is evolving too rapidly for people to keep up with it. Shouldn\u2019t dental technology be evolving just as quickly as computer technology? The Microsoft Corporation had the Windows 8 system on the market for a very short time inasmuch as the Windows 10 system was invented shortly after the Windows 8 system became publicly available. One would think that if computer technology evolves that quickly, even dental floss would have been phased out years ago and we would now be using some kind of small, handheld rod with some kind of sterilization light at the end of it to eliminate plaque from in between our teeth. When you think about it, floss has to be the most primitive item in existence. The irony of it is that dentists will scream their heads off at their patients on how they must use floss or all their teeth are going to fall out. However, I did not begin using dental floss until I was 10 years old, and all my teeth had not fallen out by then, excluding any of my baby teeth. In fact, I don\u2019t remember getting any cavities the year before then. Therefore, it is apparent that the benefits of flossing are so overrated. And please don\u2019t say that I was lucky. I hate that word \u201clucky,\u201d because it is so unrealistic. It gives me the image in my mind of someone with a ridiculously big grin on their face saying \u201cYou\u2019re so lucky!\u201d in a voice that sounds similar to that of Barney the Purple Dinosaur or some cartoon character. Moreover, I have never been lucky at anything throughout my life. I\u2019ve had to work hard for everything that I\u2019ve gotten throughout my life, and I\u2019ve gone up against many odds along the way. In my world, being lucky is an optical illusion altogether. Anyhow, if you don\u2019t believe my point about dental floss, watch the YouTube video below and it will tell you how certain experts agree that using dental floss is virtually futile to oral hygiene. What is interesting about this same video is that one of the experts states that if you use mouthwash, you don\u2019t need to use dental floss. After watching this same video, you won\u2019t feel subconscious about not flossing at night once in a while whenever you\u2019re so tired that you just want to go straight to bed rather than mess with string, which is what dental floss is. Two years ago when I was temping at a call center and my co-workers and I were in what is called downtime, which is when telephone calls don\u2019t come into a call center for a long period of time, I got into a conversation with a co-worker of mine named India about dental care. During our conversation, I brought up the topic of tooth regeneration. However, despite how intelligent and savvy India was about many things, she told me that she had never heard of tooth regeneration before. I then explained to her exactly what it was. She then asked me whether it was the same thing as dental implants, and I told her that it wasn\u2019t inasmuch as dental implants were still prosthetic teeth whereas tooth regeneration mainly involved the transplant of natural teeth. She then smiled at me and told me that she thought that such a dental procedure seemed like an excellent idea inasmuch as people would prefer to have something real in their mouth rather than something fake. It made me think of that 1968 song by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell titled \u201cAin\u2019t Nothing Like The Real Thing.\u201d B. A Description Of Tooth Regeneration And How It All Works There are basically two different types of tooth regeneration that scientists are attempting to make available to the general public through the dental profession. The first type of tooth regeneration involves the use of an electrical current to remineralize areas of tooth decay. That is, instead of someone going to their dentist to have a decayed section of their tooth cut away and then replaced with a filling, this dental procedure would allow for their dentist to arrest the decay in their tooth and it would also allow for the previously decayed area of the tooth to restore itself back to normal. The YouTube video below provides a description of this same procedure. The second type of tooth regeneration actually involves growing back a tooth to replace one that has been removed or lost. This procedure entails transplanting some kind of pod into the gums where a tooth is missing and then using stem cells to grow a replacement tooth. Down below are two YouTube videos that describe this same procedure. Both of these tooth regeneration procedures are involving, but they are also very worthwhile. Dr. Jeremy Mao, D.D.S., Ph.D. has already submitted an application on behalf of Columbia University to obtain a patent for these same procedures. Scientists have studied alligator teeth to find out how to make these same procedures possible. Some people may not think that dentists being able to perform either tooth regeneration procedure is as important as scientists finding a permanent cure for AIDS; but because our oral health ties into many other characteristics of our overall health, both tooth regeneration procedures are going to make the world a healthier place to live in. Both of the above-described tooth regeneration procedures present themselves as the public\u2019s deliverance from the dreaded indignities of prosthetic teeth. However, there is one problem. Neither of these procedures is yet available to the public. People are currently spending a fortune on fillings, caps, bridges, crowns, dentures, and even dental implants, and it seems that the light at the end of this dreary tunnel of primitive dentistry looks dimmer than most of us may have expected. However, whenever you research tooth regeneration on the Internet, you will notice that scientists have been working fiercely to perfect this dental phenomenon for years, even over the course of the last two decades. I even recall having listened to a car radio twenty years ago and having heard a report on the news that a group of scientists had grown a natural tooth in a laboratory. I remember getting particularly furious when I read an article on the Internet about tooth regeneration back in 2002, and the person who wrote the article had the audacity to say that she didn\u2019t believe that tooth regeneration would become available to the public through the dental profession for another twenty years; and then she had the nerve to preach about how one, therefore, needed to floss their teeth every morning and every night. If I were able to remember the name of that person who wrote that article, I would e-mail her a link to the previously cited YouTube video about the futility of flossing teeth so that she would have the platinum opportunity to eat her own words. Pardon the pun. People like me who absolutely hate to floss their teeth because of the time and effort involved in it are always interested in knowing the exact date that dentists will begin performing both tooth regeneration procedures on their patients. I even saw a video on YouTube about the future in which the narrator mentioned that tooth regeneration would most likely be available to the public by 2022. However, experts have spoken in different documentaries and news clips as though tooth regeneration could become available to the public any day now. Therefore, here is the question. What is holding up the public availability of both tooth regeneration procedures? Here in the second decade of the twenty-first century, fillings, crowns, caps, bridges, dentures, abutments, and dental implants all belong inside a glass-enclosed exhibit in a downtown museum rather than in people\u2019s mouths. Once you have read the articles to which I have provided you with links herein, you immediately realize that scientists have various hurdles to jump over in making both tooth regeneration procedures available in dental offices throughout the world. It appears that the scientists, including Dr. Mao, who have taken every step to perfect both tooth regeneration procedures and make them safe to perform on humans have done just about everything they can do to make this scientific breakthrough available to everyone. However, there is still this one agency called the United States Food and Drug Administration (\u201cF.D.A.\u201d), and there is obviously other bureaucratic red tape that they have to contend with before both tooth regeneration procedures finally put the dental prosthetics industry out of business once and for all. This is where the politics kick in. Both tooth regeneration procedures do not involve the use of embryonic stem cells. Therefore, I would have to say that it is safe for me to deduce that Dr. Mao and his colleagues will not get any flak from the Religious Right during their proceedings to make both tooth regeneration procedures available to the public at large. Because many evangelicals live in parts of our country where people consume great amounts of Mountain Dew and lose their teeth regularly as a result, I can be fairly sure that even they will welcome both tooth regeneration procedures to the dental profession. However, I don\u2019t think that I can quite say the same thing about the dental prosthetics industry. These people are dead set on protecting their profits and ensuring their sales revenues at whatever cost to the public. C. The Corporate Obstacles That Are Delaying The Public Availability Of Tooth Regeneration When I was just a little kid, I remember this one news report that I saw on television regarding the milk industry. A group of scientists back then had invented some kind of synthetic milk that was less expensive and supposedly just as healthy as real milk. They planned on using it to make ice cream. There was even a little boy in the news report who sampled the ice cream containing the synthetic milk, and he said that he liked it. When I saw this news story, I was not very happy about it inasmuch as I did not like the idea of synthetic foods and beverages eventually replacing natural foods and beverages. Fortunately, the milk industry ran interference against the owner of this product and eventually kept it from ever seeing the light of day on the market. I was happy about it, and so were many other people inasmuch as very few people obviously liked the idea of putting fake stuff in their body. The milk industry did an important favor for the public at large, because such a synthetic product would have likely marked the beginning of both synthetic and genetically modified foods and beverages ( GMOs) being placed on the market in large numbers, which, unfortunately, is happening today. In my mind and in the minds of many others, the milk industry had gone up to bat for the public interests. However, truth has it that the milk industry could have just as easily been only defending their own corporate interests, because if the synthetic milk had been released to the market to be used to make ice cream, the milk industry would have suffered serious losses in sales of their own products. After all, the milk industry has always depended greatly on their business relationships with ice cream companies to generate sales revenues for themselves. Of course, the milk industry probably also saw it in their own best interests to let the public go on believing that they had everyone\u2019s best interests at heart when they ran interference against the owner of the synthetic milk product so that they would look like the heroes who protected the masses from the evil clutches of a mad scientist. This news story regarding synthetic milk and the milk industry\u2019s intervention into the prospect of the synthetic milk\u2019s entry into the market to make ice cream was not the first time that I had seen a news story like this one on television or had heard about events like these. Shortly after I had moved to New York City to work in a public sector position, my landlord, Mrs. Palladino, had a telephone conversation with me about insomnia. In that telephone conversation, she told me that she had read a magazine article back in the 1970s that revealed that a sleeping machine had been invented and that this sleeping machine helped people fall asleep quickly and safely. She explained to me that when the pharmaceutical industry got wind of it and realized how detrimental this sleeping machine would be to their sales of sedatives and tranquilizers if it were ever to get on the market, they zeroed in on the situation and purchased the patent to that sleeping machine so that they could stop it from being placed on the market. After Mrs. Palladino told me about this magazine article, I was extremely appalled by it; and I told her that it was not right for these pharmaceutical companies to do something like that inasmuch as sedatives and tranquilizers can be addictive and harmful to people after their prolonged consumption and the sleeping machine would have given people suffering from insomnia a healthy alternative to ingesting chemicals. Mrs. Palladino then explained to me that the only concern that the pharmaceutical companies had in this whole situation was their sales revenues. According to her, they couldn\u2019t have cared less about the rights and the welfare of the consumer. What immediately comes to mind is a similar conversation between a friend and me that I described in my previous Hub titled \u201c Secular Medicine Saves Lives.\u201d That is, therein I stated that I had told a friend about a permanent cure for allergies that reportedly existed in the People\u2019s Republic of China, and she responded to me that such a permanent cure would likely never be marketed here in the United States of America inasmuch as too many very rich moguls who owned the companies that manufactured antihistamines and other allergy-related medications would stand in its way in order to prevent such a medical breakthrough from jeopardizing their profits and sales revenues. Therefore, it is plain to see that greedy corporate moguls seldom have the public\u2019s best interests at heart here in the land of milk and honey. When I saw the actor Mark Ruffalo appear on an edition of the HBO series Real Time With Bill Maher not too long ago, Mr. Ruffalo stressed to Bill Maher that this reprehensible kind of conduct among corporate moguls was quite common. Now, I have nothing against the free enterprise system, and I am all for the rule of laissez-faire whenever anyone wishes to conduct business here in the United States of America so long as they do not break the law. After all, our country was built on capitalism. However, whenever greedy corporate shysters collectively strive to obstruct the advancement of any kind of science or technology, including dental technology, this is where I feel that either the Federal government or the public at large or both needs to do damage control. In figurative words, no greedy corporate shyster has the right to fly his wife first class to France simply for her to get her hair done at an exclusive beauty salon in Paris at the expense and detriment of everyday people\u2019s health and well-being. The dental prosthetics market, which includes the sales of dental implants, crowns, bridges, caps, fillings, dentures, and abutments, is a multimillion-dollar industry. Anyone who has ever been to the dentist for anything more than just a regular checkup should know that getting a crown or even a filling is not cheap. Getting dentures and even dental implants cannot only be expensive but also a nightmare for anyone who has never been down that road before. Greedy corporate shysters are everywhere in the United States of America, and the dental prosthetics industry is no exception to that rule. Right at this very moment somewhere in our country, there is likely a greedy corporate shyster sitting at his desk and smoking a cigar either in his study den at home or in his office, and he is thinking about what he is going to do next to stop decent individuals in the scientific community like Dr. Mao from ever making both tooth regeneration procedures available to the dental profession so that everyone can have access to it. Perhaps there may not be news stories popping up everywhere on the Internet or over the television and radio airwaves about the dental prosthetics industry engaging in this reprehensible kind of conduct. However, if you research the pattern of conduct that corporations have engaged in over the past four decades, you will find an astronomical number of reasons to suspect the dental prosthetics industry of engaging in this reprehensible type of conduct. Whether or not anyone can actually prove that this reprehensible type of conduct is going on in the dental prosthetics industry, we still must presume the worst and take action on it inasmuch as it could make a difference between both tooth regeneration procedures being available to the public next year or not being available to the public until the next century. The corporate moguls who own, operate, and profit from the dental prosthetics industry are likely well aware that once both tooth regeneration procedures become fully available to the entire world, the demand for their products is going to plummet rapidly. Never mind any reports or news stories that you see on the Internet about this same industry prospering into a multibillion-dollar industry by 2021. Owners of video stores back in the early part of the twenty-first century all probably thought that they would be living in some plush mansion out in Santa Barbara, California by now, but we all know what happened to that industry after more sophisticated forms of television technology came along such as the DVR and Video-On-Demand. Netflix, Amazon Prime, and even YouTube did not help their situation either after these same three entities came into existence. At first, people are going to be able to get outrageously good deals on dental implants and other prosthetic dental materials (e.g. fillings, caps, crowns, bridges, and dentures) after both tooth regeneration procedures become available to the public at large. Extensive dental work involving these items will likely become more affordable than it has ever been in the history of our nation. It will have to do so, because the dental prosthetics industry will be standing on its last legs financially by then. The amount of unemployment and underemployment in our nation will maintain a market for this industry, because these prosthetic dental materials will become so cheap that this industry will be desperate to sell them in one way or another; and consumers with limited incomes will be the only ones buying them at that point in time. Of course, if the problem with joblessness in our country diminishes significantly in the near future, then the demand for these bargain prosthetic dental materials will decrease drastically. It\u2019s kind of like the situation back in the late 1980s and the early 1990s in which once CDs became common, record stores began giving outrageously exceptional deals on regular vinyl records inasmuch as fewer people were buying them. Of course, regular vinyl records eventually made a comeback to the market because of their sentimental nature. However, there is nothing sentimental about dentures, false teeth, and prosthetic dental items, and the sales backlash that the dental prosthetics industry will initially experience subsequent to the public availability of tooth regeneration will not last forever. Therefore, once both tooth regeneration procedures become available to the public at large, profits and sales revenues for the companies that manufacture prosthetic dental materials will never be the same again; and eventually this same industry is going to collapse and disappear forever. Some of you may be questioning how the dental insurance industry is going to respond to the public availability of both tooth regeneration procedures. My guess is about as good as yours. It really depends on how expensive such procedures will be. If these two procedures are less expensive than having prosthetic dental materials placed in dental patients\u2019 mouths, then the dental insurance industry will likely see it as more cost-effective for them to insure both tooth regeneration procedures and discontinue insuring any prosthetic-related dental procedures. If the dental insurance industry decides to go down that road, then their actions will further speed up the eventual collapse of the dental prosthetics industry altogether. On the other hand, if dental prosthetics companies immediately begin offering bargain prices on their products, the dental insurance industry may cut them some slack. At least for a while, that is. Unless I could somehow get a hold of what the cost factor would be, I cannot really speculate how the dental insurance industry is going to respond to the public availability of both tooth regeneration procedures. However, I can say that if the owners of these dental insurance companies are conscientious about the oral health of their customers, then they could possibly feel more inclined to grant coverage for both tooth regeneration procedures and then eventually deny coverage for any prosthetic-related dental procedure altogether from that point on. Nevertheless, let\u2019s not get excited just yet about the prospective extinction of dental implants, dentures, and the likes. Greedy corporate shysters in the dental prosthetics industry are going to run interference any way they can against Dr. Mao and his colleagues from making both tooth regeneration procedures a complete reality for everyone. They will see opportunities to do so in the form of finding creative ways to get the F.D.A. to deny Dr. Mao and his colleagues the approval they need from that Federal government agency to release both tooth regeneration procedures to the dental market. Greedy corporate shysters will pay lawyers exorbitant quantities of money to bring legal actions against Dr. Mao and his colleagues and to contact whatever government agencies they need to do so in order to throw legal roadblocks at Dr. Mao and his colleagues from ever being able to make both tooth regeneration procedures available to the dental profession and the public at large. These are the kinds of disgraceful tactics that greedy corporate shysters use to protect their own profits and sales revenues at the expense and detriment of others. These injustices have happened in the past; and they will continue to happen, unless public officials and consumers collectively stop them in their tracks. D. A Solution That Would Speed Up The Public Availability Of Tooth Regeneration Instead of just sitting back and complaining about what the dental prosthetics industry most likely is doing to delay and even obstruct the availability of both tooth regeneration procedures here in the United States of America, I believe that the best course of action is for all of us to do something about it. The question is, \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d These greedy corporate shysters have so much money that it is not going to be easy for any of us to undermine their efforts to deprive the world of both tooth regeneration procedures. Some of you may be thinking about writing letters to your elected officials for that matter. My response to your course of action is that it can\u2019t hurt. However, I believe that there really is only one truly effective course of action that the public can take to stop these greedy corporate shysters in the dental prosthetics industry from getting in the way of both tooth regeneration procedures becoming available to the public someday in the near future. People have large quantities of money invested in stocks that fund these companies that manufacture prosthetic dental materials. Many of you out there who are reading this Hub may be one of those investors. Therefore, any of you who have money invested in these companies need to sell those stocks now and pull your money out of these companies while you can. In other words, as the saying goes, if you take away the food, the cockroaches starve and eventually die. In this case, the greedy corporate shysters who own these dental prosthetics companies are the cockroaches that need to be financially starved out of business. To all of you out there who may have money invested in these companies, I am well aware that your money is your money and that you are free to do with it as you please. However, if you cannot sell your stocks and pull your money investments out of these companies for the sake of the public interests, then do it for yourself. Whether you like it or not, the dental prosthetics industry is going to collapse sooner or later. These greedy corporate shysters can buy themselves more time to extend their lavish lifestyles at the expense and detriment of others, but their dental prosthetics empires are not going to last forever. Once both tooth regeneration procedures become available to the general public, your stocks are going to plummet so quickly in value that you will not know what hit you; and you just don\u2019t want to be caught up in that rapid loss of money that investors who still have their money tied up in stocks with these companies will suffer. Moreover, these greedy corporate shysters in the dental prosthetics industry don\u2019t care about anybody but themselves, and they are simply not worth it. This is something that affects everyone of every socioeconomic structure, because most everybody would prefer to have a natural set of teeth rather than have a mouth full of crowns, dental implants, and other prosthetic dental materials. E. My Conclusion Regarding The Future Of Tooth Regeneration The greedy corporate shysters in the dental prosthetics industry may not make themselves or their reprehensible actions readily obvious to the public at large, but you only have to be aware of the unusual delay of both tooth regeneration procedures becoming publicly available to know that it is more likely than not that these same greedy corporate shysters are doing everything that they can to stand between the public and tooth regeneration. The dental prosthetics industry has long outlived its purpose here in the United States of America, and it is time to put these jokers out of business once and for all to clear the pathway for new and improved dental technology in the form of tooth regeneration. If investors pull their money out of these self-serving companies and sell their stocks, these companies will eventually weaken and lose their financial ability to interfere with the efforts of Dr. Mao and others like him to make both tooth regeneration procedures available to the world. If these companies\u2019 monetary assets begin to dry up, they will be spending so much of their financial resources in trying to keep themselves afloat that they won\u2019t have the time or the economic stamina to throw political roadblocks at Dr. Mao and others like him. All of us could have a healthy mouth of pearly whites if we just work together to make it happen. Here in the second decade of the twenty-first century, dental implants, false teeth, dentures, fillings, crowns, bridges, caps, and abutments all belong in a glass-enclosed exhibit in a downtown museum rather than in anyone\u2019s mouth.","label":0}
{"text":"High-Level Law Enforcement Official Charged With Child Porn, Record Arrests Under Trump: One of the highest law enforcement officials to date, a State of California deputy attorney general, has been charged with possession of child pornography, while at the same time one of the largest sex slave rings on the West Coast continues to be rolled up by law enforcement. California Deputy Attorney General Raymond Liddy, in office since 2008, was charged with \"possession of images of children engaged in sexually explicit conduct\" after an Internet service provider (ISP) sent a tip to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that a possibly illegal image had been uploaded. The tip was forwarded to the San Diego Internet Crimes Against Children task force, which obtained a search warrant and probed further into the user's emails and online chats. The search, according to the criminal complaint filed by the FBI, turned up, among other images, one of a prepubescent girl naked from the waist down with her legs spread wide apart, engaged in \"sexually explicit conduct.\" [FBI Complaint] The arrest takes place as a separate investigation in California has resulted in the busting of one of the largest human trafficking networks on the West Coast, by the Tulare County Sheriff\u2019s Department, Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Department, Los Angeles Regional Human Trafficking Task Force, and the California Department of Justice. On July 27th the Los Angeles Daily News reported that 13 girls and young women had been rescued from forced sex slavery in more than a dozen communities including in Chatsworth, Burbank, West Hollywood and Las Vegas. At a press conference on Thursday, July 27th, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra noted that the victims were Americans kidnapped or lured from American homes. Becerra said:  \u201cHuman trafficking, which includes sex and labor trafficking, is one of the fasting growing crimes in the world. Its reach is not limited to foreign countries...In California, human trafficking is reported here in our state more than in any other.\u201d  The investigation of the sex slave ring began with a missing persons report of a teenager from Tulare County in late 2016. Investigators found that traffickers used high-end sports cars, such as a 2017 Maserati Ghibli, a 2017 Maserati Levante, and a 2016 Porsche Panameran, to transport girls throughout the western United States. The Liddy arrest and the human trafficking ring bust take place during a banner year for pedophile arrests. One analysis at TownHall.com concludes that in the first few months of the year 2017, there were already more than three times the arrests on pedophilia charges as in the entire year of 2014, at least 1500 across a number of prosecutions in California, Texas, Tennessee, Virginia, Michigan, and Illinois. On February 23, within his symbolic first 100 days of office, President Donald Trump held a meeting on human trafficking, which includes victims of child sex slavery, in which he promised to bring the \"full weight and force\" of the government at the federal level down on human traffickers. The declaration was largely ignored by the mainstream media. Raymond Liddy is the son of G. Gordon Liddy, the Nixon White House operative who became famous during the Watergate scandal. Furor and Frustration Over Pizzagate Despite the brisk pace of law enforcement activity so far this year in pedophile and human trafficking arrests, many followers of the the affair referred to as Pizzagate in the mainstream media, which has branded it as \"fake news,\" are frustrated law enforcement has not followed up on what they say is evidence which is sufficient to also trigger law enforcement investigation. In one instance, a citizen researcher posted what appeared to be a screenshot of an email inbox with a message from a Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department email address, belonging to Officer Marcus Stevens, acknowledging the receipt of attached files. The files, he says are encoded child porn photos which, according to the blogger \"Titus Frost,\" were found in the hard-drive of a computer belonging to James Alefantis, the owner of Comet Pizza in DC. Alefantis recently was interviewed by Megyn Kelly of Fox News on an ordeal, which was widely reported, when a man with a gun walked into his pizza shop, fired off one shot, and happened to hit the computer closet, possible damaging or destroying the store computer. The incident took place a few days after Frost posted his screenshop image of emails to Officer Marcus Stevens. The arrest of Richard Liddy marks one of the first high-level officials in government to be prosecuted for crimes against children in recent years. In 2016, former Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Dennis Hastert, a Republican, was sentenced at a hearing in which the judge called him a \"serial child molester.\" Coincidentally, the Wikileaks dump of emails belonging to Hillary Clinton campaign manager John Podesta showed Podesta to be a friend of Hastert, who sympathized with Hastert's plight before his sentencing, once writing \"Might be time for Dennis to vanish to some undisclosed Japanese Island.\" The emails revealed that Podesta is also a friend of James Alefantis, the Comet PIzza shop owner. The social circle comprised of Podesta's friends and brother, the emails showed, have a penchant for sexually loaded images involving children and pizza, bizarre, violent art involving them as well, and cryptic talk about \"pizza\" in what is said to be code talk, with the words \"cheese pizza\" meaning \"child porn.\" Some Pizzagate investigators and commentators note that, historically, authorities such as the FBI tended to squash high-level pedophile investigations. In the Franklin Scandal, an extensive investigation in the late Eighties and early Nineties, a Nebraska state senator formed a committee to investigate allegations involving Omaha's Boy's Town, a famous orphanage. Both state law enforcement officials and local police believed the witnesses, dozens of children, some of them grown up. But the FBI, instead of following up on the evidence, charged one of the witnesses, Alisha Owens, for perjury, and arranged a tainted grand jury presentation which omitted critical exculpatory evidence. The investigation effectively ended when the lead investigator for the committee, Gary Caradori, died in a small plane crash. The story of the Franklin Scandal is documented in a film which was pulled by the Discovery Channel at the last minute, \"Conspiracy of Silence.\" Observers of high-level pedophile investigations have noted that, although most of the pedophile arrests since Trump took office have been executed by local and state authorities, not federal, Trump's high-profile public posture on the issue may have given the green light to what they say are the \"white hats\" in law enforcement, which they claim is compromised by internal divisions. The Trump administration's stance, they say, may yield state witnesses to investigate and possibly prosecute even those who at this point are only persons of interest in \"Pizzagate.\"","label":1}

{"text":"VIDEO: Michael Moore \u2014 \u2018I Refuse To Live In A Country Where\u2019 Trump Is President\u2019: Good. Don\u2019t let the door hit you in the over-sized ass on the way out. Michael Moore is now declaring that he refuses \u201cto live in a country where Donald Trump is President.\u201d Then he went on to make no sense, except in a revolutionary way when he stated that he also wasn\u2019t planning on leaving. Darn it. He appeared on Colbert\u2019s show (of course) and the two of them went off on President Trump yet again. Moore is calling for the formation of a citizen army to unseat the President. That\u2019s called incitement and he should be prosecuted for it. Then he tried to make it seem like he\u2019s joking (he\u2019s not) and said they have to bring Trump down with satire. Lame.  From The Daily Caller:  Michael Moore says that he refuse \u201cto live in a country where Donald Trump is president.\u201d \u201cI refuse to live in a country where Donald Trump is president and I\u2019m not leaving,\u201d the 63-year-old filmmaker said during his appearance Wednesday night on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d \u201cSo somethings gotta change,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have to form an army of citizens and come at him like a swarm of bees where he\u2019s hit one way, all the way. Because I think the way to bring him down is with satire.\u201d 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now \u201cHis thin skin, as you\u2019ve pointed out so well, is so thin,\u201d he continued. \u201cAll we need is like a thousand or a million little comedy shivs\u2013just, you know, non-violent, don\u2019t hurt him, but just under his skin. Because he can\u2019t take being laughed at.\u201d The filmmaker also went after the president after Trump announced via Twitter that the \u201cUnited States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals\u201d to serve in the military.  He\u2019s literally advocating killing Trump with comedy because he is so thin-skinned. Dream on. What a moron. I think he\u2019s doing this just to get airtime and attention. He can\u2019t possibly be serious. Far more people are laughing at Moore and Colbert than they are Trump. Trust me on that one. They looked like unhinged buffoons. Moore of course went after the banning of transgenders in the military, which was the right thing to do and I commend President Trump for it. \u201cWhat\u2019s so disgusting about this\u2026if you are transgender trying to get by in this society\u2026 I can\u2019t think of any more brave people to have then transgender,\u201d Moore explained, adding that those reportedly serving in the military should refuse to leave. Except that depending on what the military decides, they don\u2019t have a say in the matter. But of course, Moore has never served, so he has no idea what he is blathering about. Moore talked about having warned Hillary Clinton about Trump. At least that much he got right. \u201cI actually contacted the people in the Clinton campaign and said \u2018I think you need to spend more time in Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Pennsylvania,\u2019\u201d Moore said. \u201cThese are the Brexit States of America. And there\u2019s a lot of angry people. They don\u2019t sorta like Trump that much, but they see him as their human molotov cocktail that they want to just throw into the system that has hurt them so badly. I couldn\u2019t get anybody to listen to me.\u201d Clinton lost, Trump won and Moore can\u2019t stand it. He should either get over it or leave. I\u2019m all for him leaving frankly. If his only plan is to bludgeon Trump with jokes, then he\u2019s delusional. These people never ever learn.","label":1}
{"text":"BREAKING: California Is Officially First \u2018Sanctuary State\u2019 \u2013 Passed By Senate: We all knew this was coming, but somehow I never really thought they\u2019d go all the way. California just did\u2026 early this morning the California legislature voted to approve a bill that would limit police cooperation with federal immigration authorities, according to multiple reports. This officially makes them the first full-fledged sanctuary state in the union. Bonus, yesterday a federal judge ruled against Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the potential to withhold government assistance from Chicago and other so-called sanctuary cities. A showdown is looming and it\u2019s going to get ugly folks. This bill will prohibit additional jail time meant to allow immigration enforcement officials to take undocumented immigrants arrested for other reasons into custody. In other words, it stymies ICE. The measure that passed however will still allow jail and prison officials to notify the federal government if they have arrested an undocumented immigrant with a felony record. But I wouldn\u2019t count on it. ICE will still be able to interview suspects in custody. Governor Jerry Brown is expected to sign the legislation.  The bill was argued over for some time, but it was passed at the last minute. The final version of the bill was released Monday but California requires bills to be published in their final form for 72 hours before a vote. California\u2019s lower chamber passed the bill on Friday. The California Senate wrapped its session up this morning following the vote. This comes less than one day after that federal judge blocked Jeff Session\u2019s from pulling funding from sanctuary cities. I don\u2019t think that is going to hold up legally though. A number of progressive cities across the country have sought to defy President Trump\u2019s immigration enforcement policies. They require that state and local communities allow federal immigration access to detention facilities and provide 48 hours notice before they release an illegal alien wanted by federal authorities. Otherwise, these illegal aliens are simply released back into the general population.  California is the most leftist state in the nation, so it figures this would happen there first. They are broke and have turned themselves into a third-world hellhole. Heck, San Diego is sanitizing the streets because hepatitis killed 15 and sickened 400 this month. That didn\u2019t come from the homeless, it came from illegal aliens bringing it from south of the border. Another deadly gift to Americans. Sacramento is actually \u2018paying\u2019 gang bangers now not to kill people. They\u2019ve totally lost it in a communist frenzy over there. Looks like Democrats want to make California Mexico again.","label":1}
{"text":"The Left Is Merciless at Keeping Conservatives in the Closet: Dennis Prager is a columnist for The Daily Signal, nationally syndicated radio host, and creator of PragerU. The dominant force in America and many other Western countries today is fear of the left. This is a result of the fact that the most dynamic religion of the past 100 years has been neither Christianity nor Islam. It has been leftism. Whoever does not recognize this does not understand the contemporary world. Leftism\u2014in its incarnations, such as Marxism, communism, and socialism; expressed through egalitarianism, environmentalism, and feminism; in its denigration of capitalism and Western civilization, especially America and Israel; in its supplanting of Christianity and Judaism; through its influence on Christianity and Judaism; in its celebration of race; and in its replacing of reason with romanticism\u2014has almost completely taken over the news and entertainment media and institutions of education. There is a largely (though not entirely) nonviolent reign of ideological terror in America. In almost every area of life, people fear antagonizing the left. Last week, before my speech at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, a man employed by the university (I will not say in what department) walked over to me, looked around to see whether anyone was watching, and whispered in my ear, \u201cI\u2019m a conservative.\u201d This happens just about everywhere I speak. People whisper\u2014yes, whisper\u2014that they are conservative or they support President Donald Trump. The last time I experienced people looking around to check whether they were seen speaking to me was with dissidents in the Soviet Union. People call my radio show from all over the country to say that their fellow musicians, nurses, teachers, or employees do not know that they are conservative, let alone that they support the president. I have called contemporary conservatives in America Marranos, the name given during the 15th-century Spanish Inquisition to Jews who hid their Judaism while appearing to be Catholics, lest they be persecuted. I do not compare the consequences: Losing one\u2019s friends or employment is not the same as losing one\u2019s home or one\u2019s life. But otherwise, the label is apt. Because of my widely covered conducting of the Santa Monica Symphony Orchestra at the Walt Disney Concert Hall last summer, members of some of the most prestigious orchestras in America have opened up to me, telling me they are conservative but would never reveal this fact to their fellow musicians. They fear either losing their position or, more likely, being socially ostracized. Why are so many Democrats shocked when a Republican is elected president? Because, as they themselves say, they \u201cdon\u2019t know anyone\u201d who voted for the Republican. The primary reason for this is the people in their life who voted for Trump\u2014professional colleagues, and even friends and relatives\u2014are afraid to tell them. There are two reasons the left labels most conservatives and all Trump supporters \u201cwhite supremacists,\u201d \u201cneo-Nazis,\u201d and \u201cracists.\u201d One is to defeat conservatives without having to defeat conservative ideas. The other is to instill fear: Speak out and you will suffer the consequences. Parents call my radio show and ask what they should tell their children at college when they ask whether they should risk receiving a lower grade for divulging their conservative politics in a paper or on an exam. It is becoming more and more common for leftist mobs to gather in front of a conservative\u2019s home, scream epithets at the conservative\u2019s family members, and vandalize the home. Just last week, the Associated Press reported:  Protesters are targeting the northern Virginia home of the National Rifle Association\u2019s top lobbyist \u2026 Chris Cox \u2026 as well as his wife\u2019s nearby decorating business. \u2026 Libby Locke, a lawyer for the Cox family, said the vandalism included spraying fake blood and defacing the home with stickers.  Left-wing student mobs routinely take over the offices of university deans, professors, and even presidents. The few non-left-wing professors on any campus understand their lives will be made miserable if they speak out. The widely reported case of liberal biology professor Bret Weinstein at Evergreen State College in Washington is directly on point. In May 2017, Weinstein was surrounded by about 50 left-wing students, who screamed curses at him outside of his classroom for refusing to participate in an event during which white people were asked to leave the campus for a day. On May 24, 2017, Weinstein tweeted: \u201cthe police told me I am not safe on campus. They can not protect me.\u201d  To be clear: the police told me I am not safe on campus. They can not protect me. Students in jeopardy. No contact from admin. George? \u2014 Bret Weinstein (@BretWeinstein) May 25, 2017  Within a few months, left-wing students and the left-wing Evergreen administration made life so miserable for the lifelong liberal professor he left the university. Since the left began spreading the lie that a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, shot a black youth because he, like most police officers, is a racist, police officers in many cities have feared taking proactive measures to prevent violent crime in black neighborhoods. They fear the left-wing mob known as the news media will ruin their reputation and end their career. In the recent case of a Philadelphia Starbucks manager who asked two black men to purchase something before giving them the code to the restroom, Starbucks immediately appeased the left-wing mob. The company didn\u2019t wait until any facts came out; it simply abandoned the manager and announced it would close every U.S. store one day in May to educate all Starbucks employees about \u201cunconscious bias.\u201d These are only a few examples of the left-wing intimidation that dominates much of American life. It does so in large measure because liberals are either too afraid to confront the left or they don\u2019t understand that the American left, not the American right, is the mortal enemy of liberalism.","label":1}
{"text":"Breitbart News Just FIRED Steve Bannon. It's A Good Day For Andrew Breitbart's Legacy.: On Tuesday, Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon \u2014 a man who used his position to shift Breitbart News into a propaganda outlet on behalf of his own political interests \u2014 found himself jobless and perhaps homeless after being unceremoniously fired by the Breitbart News board. That firing, spearheaded by the Mercer family, followed hard on President Trump destroying Bannon in a public statement after Bannon told muckraking author Michael Wolff that the Trump campaign had engaged in criminal and treasonous activity. Bannon also ushered Wolff into the heart of the West Wing, where Wolff used his position to cobble together his bestselling gossip book, Fire and Fury. Bannon\u2019s ouster is a long time in coming. Actually, Bannon never should have been hired in the first place. He was not a close friend of Andrew Breitbart\u2019s; he was instead a fellow who attempted to use his minimal documentary-making skills to ingratiate himself with Breitbart, making a movie with Breitbart as narrator. That unwatchable monstrosity was Bannon\u2019s calling card after Breitbart died; Larry Solov, Breitbart\u2019s business partner and lifelong friend, turned to Bannon in the aftermath of Breitbart\u2019s tragic passing. Bannon gradually began exerting more and more control over editorial of the site; by 2015, as outside observers noted, Bannon had shifted the site into fully political, DC-centric, Trumpian territory. This wasn\u2019t at all what Andrew had intended: Andrew saw the site as a weapon in the fight against what he called the \u201cDemocrat-Media Complex,\u201d destroying left-wing narratives crafted by the faux-objective media. Andrew believed that his site could play an outsized role in the culture war, and he saw culture as upstream of politics. And Andrew wanted to do so in the mold of the \u201chappy warrior,\u201d not as the grim-faced, stubble-bearded force of darkness Bannon attempted to project. Bannon, by contrast, saw the site as a lever to exert influence in the circles of power \u2014 or at least the impression of influence. And he would abuse and use anyone he needed to in order to pose as Darth Vader. By January 2016, it was clear to anyone with two eyes that Bannon had transformed the site into a propaganda outlet on behalf of the Trump campaign, and weaponized the site against Trump\u2019s opponents. That wasn\u2019t out of pure love for Trump \u2014 it was out of a pathetic desire to hitch his wagon to the next rising star. And it got worse: Bannon decided that he would make common cause with the execrable alt-right in order to maximize his influence. To that end, he elevated Milo Yiannopoulos, bragged about making a site founded by a proud anti-racist into a \u201cplatform for the alt-right,\u201d and used the site as his personal vendetta machine. Bannon rode Trump\u2019s star all the way to the White House \u2014 all the while, bragging that he was the real brains behind the operation. In reality, he had little to do with Trump\u2019s success: he was only on the Trump campaign at all because the Mercers placed him there, along with Kellyanne Conway. Then, in the White House, he spent his days botching policy (see the original travel ban rollout) and pushing Trump to ally with awful people (see his reported advice on Charlottesville) and posturing as the Great Thinker of Trumpism \u2014 meanwhile leaking to the press as much as he could about his enemies inside the administration and the supposed dunderhead he had to shepherd through basic tasks. Finally, in August, Trump dumped him. And Bannon went right back to the \u201cmachine\u201d he had built, ready to maximize his own profile. He launched a doomed campaign on behalf of Alabama\u2019s Roy Moore, and somehow suckered Trump into endorsing Moore; he even deployed reporters to Alabama to try to debunk Moore\u2019s alleged molestation victims, knowing full well that they were credible. He lost. And then, finally, the chickens came home to roost: all of that backbiting and self-promoting blew him up when Wolff\u2019s book came out. Trump can abide anything but disloyalty. And Bannon, it turns out \u2014 as all of us who knew him knew \u2014 is a deeply disloyal human being. Thus he had to go. Steve Bannon has never built anything; he is a creature of destruction. He rides more powerful hosts until they drop beneath him, whispering sweet nothings in their ears. He tried to glom onto Sarah Palin\u2019s celebrity. He did the same with Michele Bachmann, Andrew Breitbart, and Trump. All of those people built things. Bannon built nothing. He just stood atop the foundations they had erected, shouting his own name. Now, he has nothing. He built a monument to himself, and it collapsed. He has no money; the Mercers are out. He has no power; the White House is out. He has no bullhorn: Breitbart is out. He's back to what he had originally: his cunning and his nastiness and his shameless sycophancy-for-hire. Good luck to him. So, where does Breitbart go from here? The great tragedy in all of this is that Breitbart\u2019s name has been smeared with Bannon\u2019s toxicity. Now they\u2019ll have to rebuild. They can do so by either returning to Andrew\u2019s original mission, which would require some humility, some decency \u2014 or they can become a shadow of their former Bannon.com glory, trying to pander to political patrons rather than standing for truth. That\u2019s their choice. But at least for today, it\u2019s a good day for Andrew Breitbart. May they all be good days from now on.","label":1}

Hypocrites - imagine what they'd say if we started saying stuff like that about them. They're melt if we use the \"wrong\" pronoun, let alone spouting unfounded psychobabble drivel about them. So now we're to be lectured and demeaned by a heterosexual woman (because that's what this Person would say she is). In any other situation, the perpetrator would be told she was deeply homophobic, and to fuck off. Why I stopped reading \"the gay press\". Fucking hate speech.

Sanders recounted learning about \"oligarchic societies\" when he was a high school student in Brooklyn. Described to him as \"small developing countries\" in which the \"economic and political life of the nation were controlled by a handful of very wealthy people,\" Sanders admitted it \"never occurred to me as a kid in Brooklyn that the United States of America, our great nation, could move in that direction.\" But, he added, \"that is precisely ... what is happening today.\"  Bernie Sanders: 'This Is Exactly What We Mean When We Talk About Oligarchy' https:\/\/t.co\/8gqKgk0NZ8 @OpenSecretsDC @SunFoundation \u2014 EcoWatch (@EcoWatch) 1493255408.0  While commending graduating students and their parents for often working multiple jobs in order to make ends meet, Sanders lamented that more than fifty percent of all new income now \"goes to the top one percent\" of earners.

An America based on progressive, humane values, not the values of the oligarchy.\" As he railed against economic inequality and a system rigged in favor of the wealthy and powerful, Sanders told students that unity would be key in order to defeat the destructive forces represented by President Donald Trump. Sanders referenced his Jewish heritage and his family's experience with the Holocaust in Europe, which he said offered important lessons for \"tough times\" like these. \"From that experience, what was indelibly stamped on my mind was the understanding that we must never allow demagogues to divide us up by race, by religion, by national origin, by gender or sexual orientation,\" Sanders said to wide applause. \"Black, white, Latino, Asian American, Native American, Christian, Jew, Muslim and every religion, straight or gay, male or female\u2014we must stand together. This country belongs to all of us.\" Sanders concluded on a message of hope, telling the graduates that Americans are \"prepared to stand together; if we take on greed and selfishness; if we refuse to allow demagogues to divide us up there is no end to what the great people of our nation can accomplish.\" Watch the full commencement address: The full transcript of Sanders remarks follows: You know and I know that these are tough times for our country. But I do want to say that standing up here and looking out at the beautiful people in front of me, I have enormous confidence in the future of our country. Let me begin by congratulating the graduating class of 2017. Today is an important day in your lives, something that I know you have worked very hard to achieve, and I want to wish all of you the very best of luck in your future endeavors. I do want, on behalf of my wife, Jane, and myself, to pray that you all live healthy and happy lives, doing the work you enjoy surrounded in love by family and friends. Let me thank President Michelle Anderson, Nicole Haas, the Brooklyn College Administration, faculty and staff and all of you for inviting Jane and me back to Brooklyn where we were both born and raised. I am greatly honored of the honorary degree you have given me. I grew up in Flatbush and, like Senator Schumer, graduated from James Madison High School. My wife, Jane, was also raised Flatbush and Bedford-Stuyvesant, and graduated from St. Savior's High School a few miles away from here. In 1959, as a first-generation college student I attended Brooklyn College for a year\u2014a year which had a major impact in my life. After that year I left for the University of Chicago, where I eventually graduated. My mom had died the previous year and I felt it was time to leave the neighborhood and see what the rest of the world looked like. My childhood in Brooklyn was shaped by two profound realities. First, my mom, dad and older brother, who graduated from Brooklyn College, lived in a 3 1\/2 room rent-controlled apartment. As with many of your families who don't have a lot of money, financial pressures caused friction and tension within our household. From those experiences of growing up without a lot of money, I have never forgotten that there are millions of people throughout this country who struggle to put food on the table, pay the electric bill, try to save for their kids' education or for retirement\u2014people who against great odds are fighting today to live in dignity. The second reality that impacted my life was that my father left Poland at the age of 17 from a community which was not only very poor, but from a country where anti-Semitism, pogroms and attacks on Jews were not uncommon. While my father emigrated to the United States, and escaped Hitler and the Holocaust, many in his family did not. For them, racism, right-wing extremism and ultra-nationalism were not \"political issues.\" They were issues of life and death\u2014and some of them died horrific deaths. From that experience, what was indelibly stamped on my mind was the understanding that we must never allow demagogues to divide us up by race, by religion, by national origin, by gender or sexual orientation. Black, white, Latino, Asian American, Native American, Christian, Jew, Muslim and every religion, straight or gay, male or female, we must stand together. This country belongs to all of us. As a United States senator from Vermont let me give you a very brief overview of some of the serious crises we currently face\u2014crises which do not often get attention they deserve. As a student at James Madison High School, many years ago, I recall my social studies teacher talking about how there were small developing countries around the world that were \"oligarchic\" societies\u2014places where the economic and political life of the nation were controlled by a handful of very wealthy people. It never occurred to me as a kid in Brooklyn that the United States of America, our great nation, could move in that direction. But that is precisely, in my view, what is happening today. Today, the top one-tenth of one percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Twenty Americans now own as much wealth as the bottom half of America and one family now owns more wealth than the bottom 42 percent of our people. In the last 17 years, while the middle class continues to decline, we have seen a tenfold increase in the number of billionaires. Today in America CEOs are earning almost 350 times more than the average worker makes. In terms of income, while you and your parents are working in some cases two or three jobs, 52 percent of all new income goes to the top one percent. At the same time as we have more income and wealth inequality than any other major nation, 43 million Americans live in poverty, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country in earth, half of older workers have nothing in the bank as they approach retirement and in some inner cities and rural communities, youth unemployment is 20, 30, 40 percent. Unbelievably, in our country today as a result of hopelessness and despair we are seeing a decline in life expectancy. People are giving up. And they're turning to drugs, to alcohol, and even to suicide. And because of poverty, racism today in a broken criminal justice system we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. Those people are disproportionately black, Latino and Native American. Directly related to the oligarchic economy that we currently have is corrupt political system which is undermining American democracy and it's important we talk about that and understand that. As a result of the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, corporations and billionaires are able to spend unlimited sums of money on elections. The result is that today a handful of billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars every single year, often on ugly 30-second TV ads, helping to elect candidates who represent the rich and the powerful get elected. And we are seeing the results of how oligarchy functions right now in Congress where the Republican leadership wants to throw 23 million American off of health insurance, cut Medicaid by over $800 billion, defund Planned Parenthood, cut food stamps and other nutrition programs by over $200 billion, cut Head Start and after school programs, and by the way, make drastic cuts in Pell grants and other programs that help working class kids be able to go to college. And, unbelievably, at exactly the same time that they are throwing people off health care, making it harder to people to go to college, they have the chutzpah to provide the $300 billion in tax breaks to the top one percent. In other words, the very, very rich are getting richer and they get huge tax cuts. The working class and the middle class are struggling and they are seeing drastic cuts in life or death programs that could mean survival or not for those families. Now, in response to these very serious crises it seems to me that we have two choices. First we can throw up our hands in despair. We can say, \"I am not going to get involved.\" That is understandable. But it is wrong. Because the issues that we deal with today\u2014the economic issues, the social issues, the racial issues, the environmental issues\u2014not only impact your lives, they impact the lives of future generations and you do not have the moral right to turn your back on saving this planet and saving future generations. The truth is that the only rational choice we have, the only real response we can make is to stand up and fight back \u2014 reclaim American democracy and create a government that works for all of us, not just the one percent. And for us to do that it is necessary that we fight for a vision of a new America. An America based on progressive, humane values, not the values of the oligarchy. And what does that mean, briefly in concrete terms? It means that, no, we are not going to throw 23 million Americans off the health care they have. We are going to bring about health care for all as a right, not a privilege. It means that, no, we are not, as the current administration does, deny the reality of climate change. We are going to take on the fossil fuel industry, transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. It means no we are not going to cut Pell grants and other student assistance. We are going to do what Germany, what Scandinavia, what countries all over the world do. And that is to make certain the public colleges and universities are tuition-free and we're going to significantly lower student debt because we believe that anyone in America who has the ability and the desire to be able to get a higher education regardless of his or her income. And no we're not going to do what the attorney general of the United States now wants. We're not going to put more people in jail. We're going to fix a broken criminal justice system and invest in education and jobs for our young people, not more jails and incarceration. No, we're not going to defund Planned Parenthood. We're going to vigorously defend a woman's right to choose. My friends, let me conclude by saying this. We live in the wealthiest country in the history of the world. We are seeing exploding technology, which if used well, has extraordinary potential to improve life. We are an intelligent and hardworking people. If we are prepared to stand together; if we take on greed and selfishness; if we refuse to allow demagogues to divide us up there is no end to what the great people of our nation can accomplish. So today as you graduate Brooklyn College, my message to you is very simple. Think big, not small, and help us create the nation that we all know we can become. Thank you all very much.

{"text":"It\u2019s Time To Purge The Pervs From Politics\u2014And Let Women Step In: This story reflects the views of this author, but not necessarily the editorial position of Fast Company. On November 9, 2016, Hillary Clinton, fresh from defeat by a pussy-grabbing misogynist, predicted better times ahead for women: \u201cNow, I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday someone will\u2013and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.\u201d One year later, the glass ceiling remains intact, especially in politics. Women currently make up only 19.6% of the House of Representatives, 21% of the Senate, and only 20% of President Trump\u2019s cabinet. But while men still hold most of the power, the country\u2019s faith in men is starting to shatter, with every shard reflecting back a seemingly endless array of famous sexual predators. Every day, more prominent men in politics, entertainment, media, and tech are revealed to have sexually harassed or assaulted women. Perhaps\u2013just perhaps\u2013the political power structure is due for a change. America is not experiencing an epidemic of sexual predation so much as an epidemic of revelation, as a wave of rage and validation propels survivors to step forward. A national conversation is now happening. As a country we\u2019ve had this conversation before\u2013 in 1991, when Anita Hill\u2019s testimony against Clarence Thomas brought the term \u201csexual harassment\u201d into the mainstream; in 1998, when Bill Clinton\u2019s relationship with Monica Lewinsky spotlighted male abuse of power over female subordinates (additionally, he was accused of rape); and in 2016, when Donald Trump\u2013who over multiple decades has been accused of raping his first wife as well as a 13-year-old girl, sexually assaulting 15 women, peeping on teenage girls as they changed their clothes, and other acts of misogynist abuse \u2013became president. These \u201cnational conversations\u201d generally ended with the women being publicly disparaged and the men facing few consequences. This time feels different. For the most part, women are actually being believed. Lifelong sexual predators are being forced to resign, undergo investigations, and even face criminal charges. Feminist writers warn, rightly, that a backlash looms. But in the meantime, a lesson is being driven home: Don\u2019t put male politicians on pedestals, unless you want to clean up the damage when they fall. This was not the lesson the male-dominated media wanted to teach us. Following Trump\u2019s win, a flurry of editorials were written on the fallacy of \u201cidentity politics\u201d and the importance of centering the needs of beleaguered white men, so that they would not elect an emotionally unhinged white supremacist sexual assaulter in the future. This was the wrong takeaway from 2016; what we really needed, to borrow a phrase from the Groper-in-Chief, was extreme vetting. Imagine a world in which these powerful male predators had been outed earlier: the pain that would have been avoided, the lives that wouldn\u2019t have been destroyed. Imagine what women could have accomplished in a society where they assumed they would be believed, that abuse would not be tolerated, that their workplace was safe. Imagine if Congress weren\u2019t infamously sexist. Imagine if the public trusted women politicians as much as men. Democratic senator Al Franken is being pressured to resignin the wake of sexual harassment allegations, and Republican senate candidate Roy Moore\u2019s own party is calling to for him to drop out of the race after multiple accusations that he has preyed on several teenage girls. One can reasonably assume, given recent revelations on the pervasiveness of sexual assault on Capitol Hill, that more allegations about elected officials are to come. What to do with a polity of perverts? The answer is clear\u2013they have to go. After all, it\u2019s not as if it\u2019s difficult to replace them. For every vile man, there are many talented women who have been hesitant to enter a sexist political arena. It is time to clean the House\u2013and the Senate, and most of all, the Oval Office. That Trump, whose record of misogynist abuse is longand documented, still presides over this nation as other powerful men face consequences is a travesty. He is unfit to lead for multiple reasons, as the many articles of impeachment filed against him indicate. Trump\u2019s abuse of executive privilege and his abuse of women are not unrelated\u2013like many powerful men, he committed horrific acts in part simply because he could. For decades, he has gotten away with horrendous, likely illegal, behavior. Now, perhaps, he will face the reckoning he deserves. In the meantime, women are running for office in record numbers. This is no surprise. Survey the wreckage, and the stakes are clear: in Trump\u2019s America, women are running for their lives.

{"text":"Kevin Durant supports ESPN\u2019s Jemele Hill, and so do we: A few days ago, ESPN\u2019s Jemele Hill called Donald Trump a white supremacist. The backlash was immense and has dominated a good amount of both the sports media and national media narrative. Instead of forcing you to search for her comments, I\u2019ll just lay a few of them out right here in front so we all know where we stand. (You should go and read the entire thread from that conversation, but here are some of the more potent tweets that landed her in hot water.)  Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w\/ other white supremacists.\u2014 Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) September 11, 2017   The height of white privilege is being able to \u270c ignore\u270c his white supremacy, because it's of no threat to you. Well, it's a threat to me.\u2014 Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) September 11, 2017   He has surrounded himself with white supremacists -- no they are not \"alt right\" -- and you want me to believe he isn't a white supremacist?\u2014 Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) September 11, 2017   No the media doesn't make it a threat. It IS a threat. He has empowered white supremacists (see: Charlottesville).\u2014 Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) September 12, 2017   He is unqualified and unfit to be president. He is not a leader. And if he were not white, he never would have been elected\u2014 Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) September 12, 2017  The tweets went viral. Various right wing news outlets and talking heads called for her firing. Donald Trump chimed in, finding time in his busy, busy schedule of firing off tweets about North Korea, terrorist attacks in London and \u201c The Wall\u201d to defecate out a tweet condemning ESPN, saying they \u2014 like most of the other news media, apparently \u2014 are failing. The White House then commented on the matter, saying that Hill\u2019s comments were a fireable offense \u2014 which may be the scariest takeaway from this whole thing. Think about it: The White House clamored for a private company to fire an employee over a political opinion. That way leads to totalitarianism, my friends. ESPN reportedly sent her home after a contentious meeting on Wednesday, but couldn\u2019t find a replacement for her when co-host Michael Smith refused to go on the air without her.  According to ThinkProgress, which Thursday cited \u201ctwo sources familiar with the situation,\u201d the sports network \u201creached out to two other black ESPN hosts,\u201d Michael Eaves and Elle Duncan, to take Hill\u2019s place that evening. They declined, and Smith reportedly also refused to do the show without Hill.  Somehow, Jemele Hill finds herself smack dab in the middle of a racial maelstrom that has been ravaging our country since its inception. But, now, it is churning more violently out of control than ever. Donald Trump\u2019s rise to power \u2014 borne on the wings of racially-charged, vitriolic rhetoric coupled with a promise to restore young, disenfranchised white men to power \u2014 has been like throwing accelerant on a fire that never really stopped burning. Recently, TMZ tracked down Kevin Durant and asked him what he thought about the whole mess. Durant, unsurprisingly, stood behind Hill. Why would he waver? He\u2019s already made it clear he would not visit the White House if invited, and has said quite literally he \u201cdoesn\u2019t f\u2014k with\u201d Trump. Well, it might be pretty obvious, but we support Jemele Hill as well. You can\u2019t lie if you\u2019re not wrong, and Jemele was not wrong about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is an embarrassment to our great nation. He has, as Hill said, \u201csurrounded himself with white supremacists.\u201d He has had a HUGE hand in encouraging the violence and discord we see sweeping our country, most recently in Charlottesville, where thousands of neo-Nazis and white supremacists took to the streets, chanting his name as if it were their literal battle cry. A young woman died that day. Sure, Trump wasn\u2019t behind the wheel of that death car, but he was the one pumping the tank full of gas. \"I'm behind Jemele. I support her. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. She\u2019s standing up for what she believes in. I\u2019m with it.\" - Kevin Durant Trump is a danger to our country, to our stability, to our future, to our youth, and to every single person of color, no matter their race or place of origin. He stands for violence. He stands for intolerance. We see black people being murdered in the streets by the very people who have sworn to protect them. We see anger, filth, and racially driven discriminatory laws being dragged across the White House steps. There is a travel ban. There is gerrymandering. This is not a f*cking joke. This is real. Our great nation is tearing itself apart, and the only thing Trump is presiding over is its quickening destruction. I, for one, stand alongside Jemele Hill, and stand up with every single other person who has a conscience and who wants to see equality in this country. I stand with everyone who wants to see peace. Who can\u2019t stand the thought of Nazis in the White House, or white supremacists openly marching in our streets, calling out Trump\u2019s name while he does nothing to hinder them. I stand with everyone who feels like we\u2019ve made a critical error that will take decades to unravel, if ever we can climb out of this hole. Our history as Americans is littered with missteps and violent deeds. Let us not stand idly by while we add another chapter to the sad volume of our uncaring past. Now go ahead and tell me to stick to sports. I dare you.","label":1}
{"text":"Don't Forget About the Liberal Fascists: To be clear, this column is about influential media pundits and reporters choosing which violent groups they report ... and which they ignore. \u201c... anti-fascists stand up and kick the -- \u2014 out of fascists. That\u2019s what we need!\u201d As reported by The Daily Caller, that\u2019s Norman Clement, a member of the left-wing ANSWER Coalition, introducing speakers at a Hartford, Connecticut, Sunday night vigil to \u201creflect\u201d on the Charlottesville violence over the weekend. This profane rallying cry for violence on whomever they decide is a fascist was directed to the hundreds of attendees, including New Haven mayoral candidate Marcus Paca and current Mayor Toni Harp. It\u2019s reflective of the violence fomented at Trump rallies by Scott Foval, former national field director of the left-wing Americans United for Change. He confessed, on video, of staging the violence at Trump rallies for the Democratic National Committee to provoke Trump supporters into violence. In Berkeley, California this year, left-wing activists attacked unarmed Trump supporters, hurled Molotov cocktails and smashed windows in protest of a planned speech by conservative antagonist Milo Yiannopoulos, causing $100,000 in property damage. On top of that was an incident where two Berkeley College Republicans \u201cwere attacked while conducting an interview\u201d on the campus, and another where a woman wearing a red Trump hat was pepper-sprayed in the face while being interviewed by a local CNN affiliate. This is the violent left that pundits \u201coutraged\u201d at Trump\u2019s incompetent initial articulation dangerously ignore. After an unsatisfying statement excoriating violence \u201con both sides\u201d while shockingly omitting any reference to the murdered Heather Heyer, Trump later clearly denounced the Klan and white supremacists as \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201cthugs.\u201d \u201cYou had a group on one side and you had a group on the other and they came at each other with clubs and it was vicious and it was horrible and it was a horrible thing to watch,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt is impossible to imagine President Trump saying that both sides are responsible for the violence, saying that the people that came out against these extremists are equally to blame,\u201d said The Lead host Jake Tapper. \u201cThis is a sad moment for the country,\u201d opined Don Lemon. \u201cI think it was an awful moment for the person who is supposed to represent the highest office of the land.\u201d \u201cThere today,\u201d he told, Wolf Blitzer, \u201cyou saw the real Donald Trump proving all of his critics right in that moment.\u201d Lemon defended the alt-left group because \u201cthat group protests fascism. So that group was protesting fascism.\u201d Then, Lemon forgave the left-wing violence saying, \u201cMaybe their tactics weren\u2019t exactly right ... it\u2019s messy.\u201d Their tactics were to come to the white supremacist rally armed with bats and pepper spray and attack the racists. That\u2019s messy, alright. Lemon ignored those violent thugs because the other side \u201cis a Nazi, white supremacist group\u201d and \u201cwhat they want to do in their hearts is extinguish people who look like me and who look like you, Wolf, Jewish people, black people, even women.\u201d They overlook that the violent left is also using fascist tactics, and if their ultimate goal is an all-powerful government with control over its people and businesses, as many espouse, then they, too are fascists. Yes, the klan and white supremacists are evil and, as Republican Ted Cruz says, \u201cThese bigots want to tear our country apart, but they will fail. America is far better than this.\u201d I hope so, because while it\u2019s as easy to hate Nazis as it is to love puppies, CNN seems to have an especially difficult time accepting the fact that there are leftwing criminals and thugs ideologically justifying violence. By ignoring and forgiving the violent left, are the Don Lemons of the media suggesting the shooting of Republican Representative Steve Scalise by a left-winger is not so bad compared to the murder of Heather Heyer by a neo-nazi? Once violence is accepted as legitimate political speech, only violence remains. The writer is from Delaware and is an award-winning conservative talk show host on WDEL radio.

{"text":"Political paranoia in the 21st century: Evil versus good. No, that\u2019s too deep and overarching. How about Republican versus Democrat or conservative versus liberal? Populist versus elitist? Nationalist versus globalist? Let\u2019s not forget capitalist versus socialist and Libertarian versus fascist. My point is this: Political labels abound and leave much to be desired. They signify different things to different people, if they signify anything at all. Some are pejoratives: Calling a pol a populist may elicit a smile or a sneer. Some cover so much of the political spectrum, they are meaningless. The average American would be hard-pressed to define Libertarian. For that matter, the average Libertarian would be hard-pressed to define Libertarian. Labels are purely a convenience, a bit of necessary mental laziness we rely on daily. They serve to evoke but seldom accurately portray one\u2019s beliefs or principles. Still, some adjectives do have a place in our political dialogue and it is at the edges where they may be the most accurate. There, the one label that is quite appropriate, that applies strikingly to our present political situation, and especially to the radical right, is \u201cparanoid.\u201d (The radical left is not immune to this affliction but a cursory reading of history finds the far right more heavily infected.) It is at the edges of sanity and society where one finds the ideologues holed up in the confines of their mental rigidity and dogmatism hiding from a world that is out to get them. There are only a few ways to say \u201ccrazy\u201d and they are all unambiguous. Those of you who have read Richard Hofstadter\u2019s essay, \u201cThe Paranoid Style in American Politics,\u201d will see his influence here. Let me quote him: \u201cIn recent years we have seen angry minds at work mainly among extreme right-wingers, who have demonstrated [\u2026] how much political leverage can be got out of the animosities and passions of a small minority.\u201d He was writing about Arizonan Barry Goldwater\u2019s run for the White House in 1964 but one could substitute Donald Trump and the alt-right here and do no harm. It is spookily parallel to the present day. Of the anti-Masonic (read anti-liberal or pro-conformity, if you will) movement of the early 1800s, he writes, \u201cIt attracted the support of several reputable statesmen who had only mild sympathy with its fundamental bias but who as politicians could not afford to ignore it. Still, it was a folk movement of considerable power, and the rural enthusiasts who provided its real impetus believed in it wholeheartedly.\u201d This is another uncanny parallel to our current dilemma. Replace \u201cfolk movement\u201d with the current populist reincarnation and it loses no relevancy. And there are more than a few latter-day \u201creputable statesmen\u201d to the right of center who prize re-election over integrity and honesty. Paul Ryan occasionally loses patience with Trump but is not going to abandon him and his chance to push the right-wing agenda. He gives the president a mulligan, claiming, \u201cHe\u2019s new at government.\u201d What a lame dodge! Why would you put a landlubber at the helm of state? (Ironically, it is Barry Goldwater\u2019s home state of Arizona that has given us Sens. Jeff Flake and John McCain, men of conscience who do not shrink from criticizing the president.) Hofstadter continues, \u201cI call it the paranoid style simply because no other word adequately evokes the sense of heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy I have in mind.\u201d Heated exaggeration? Trump claims the biggest inaugural crowds ever, the largest electoral win since Reagan, and $10 billion in the bank. Suspiciousness? Obama tapped my phone, the election is rigged and Comey is out to get me. Conspiratorial fantasy? The fake news is persecuting me, Ted Cruz\u2019s father had ties to Lee Harvey Oswald, and global warming is a Chinese plot. Steve Bannon is a versed conspiracist and political trickster who sees bogeymen everywhere, qualifications that will serve him well in his return to Breitbart. He also delivered the most heated exaggeration of all, touting the ineloquent Trump as the greatest public speaker since William Jennings Bryan, a statement so baldly absurd, no rebuttal is needed. Stumping at a rally for Alabama Sen.-elect, Roy Moore, Bannon whipped the crowd into a frenzy, urging them to show the world \u201cthat this populist, nationalist, conservative movement is on the rise.\u201d He is the picture of demagoguery. A 74-year-old widow at the rally explained her vote for Moore, \u201cSteve Bannon and God spoke to me [\u2026] and I voted for Moore.\u201d It is a scary mentality that puts Bannon and God in the same sentence and gives Bannon top billing. Spookiness again. Ultimately, the method becomes the message and the paranoid style overpowers any sound ideas its adherents may put forth. America has survived these political mood swings in the past and we will survive them today. Trump\u2019s election triggered the pressure valve. We will undo the damage done. And all the radical right\u2019s exaggerations, suspiciousness and conspiratorial fantasies cannot change that. Malcolm Hein lives in Newburyport.","label":1}

The stories (read this New York Times report and this New Yorker report) that have come out about Weinstein have caused us to seriously think about how we cover the entertainment business, and we\u2019ve come to an editorial decision that best balances the need to report on fandom with the need to hold Hollywood accountable. We can\u2019t forget what people like Weinstein have done. We can\u2019t let the studios sweep these stories under the rug. Forgetting is how these men get away with their behavior time and time again. So beginning immediately, Hypable will add a note to all articles about a film, TV show, book, etc. that employs an accused predator. We will include a link to a reputable report so you can educate yourself on what they\u2019ve been accused of doing. Here are a few people we will be reminding you about in every article that pertains to a film they\u2019re tied to: \u2014 Johnny Depp has been accused by his ex-wife Amber Heard and ex-associates of physically abusing the former. This will be noted in every article about Fantastic Beasts, Pirates of the Caribbean, and any other film that he\u2019s associated with. \u2013 Bryan Singer has been accused of sexually abusing young men for decades. This will be noted in every article about his next film Bohemian Rhapsody, as well as X-Men, a franchise he has directed and continues to be a producer on. \u2013 Woody Allen, who recently worked with Amazon on two projects, has been accused of sexual abusing his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow, amongst other allegations. \u2013 Harvey Weinstein. If we cover any of his upcoming films that he\u2019s produced, we will remind you about the women who spoke to The New York Times and The New Yorker. While he has been fired since the bombshell reports on his behavior, several of his business associates knew about his conduct and did nothing to stop it. And the list goes on. We\u2019ll inform you about other alleged predators, like Casey Affleck, when we cover their films. We\u2019ll continue to internally discuss who to tell you about as new information comes to light. The studios and their publicists are hoping you forget about the accusations so their projects aren\u2019t negatively affected, but at Hypable, forgetting is over. We will not forget what these people did, or in some cases, still do. These people need to be removed from Hollywood. \u201cThe predator wants your silence,\u201d Viola Davis said in a statement to victims on Tuesday. The media can no longer grant them that benefit. This morning, in honor of Hollywood\u2019s survivors, Hypable made a $500 donation to Law  ; Order: SVU star Mariska Hargitay\u2019s Joyful Heart Foundation, which \u201cpaves the way for innovative approaches to treating trauma, igniting shifts in the way the public responds to sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse, and advancing policies and legislation to ensure justice for survivors.\u201d We encourage other websites to take a similar editorial strategy, or rethink how they cover predators. Change needs to happen now \u2014 let\u2019s do it.","label":0}
{"text":"ANTIFA Is The Modern-Day Democrat KKK: What is the difference between the old Democrat, hooded, fire-bombing KKK and today\u2019s hooded, firebombing ANTIFA? Not much! Both are hate-filled, leftist, evil people, and good Democrats. Oh, the hoods of the KKK were white and today\u2019s KKK rebirth wears black hoods. And the fire of the KKK was from torches, whereas ANTIFA uses a Bic lighter, but both groups were\/are Democrat leftist groups who do not believe in the constitution of the United States and who have no respect for private property nor a citizen\u2019s right to private expression. One wonders at the bravery and conviction of the KKK\/ANTIFA cause; a bunch of thugs who have to hide behind masks and hoods and who burn property and beat people who have differing views from themselves, without having to, or, one suspects, even being able to, fully and logically explain and justify their violent actions and destructive positions. The KKK did their evil deeds based on emotion and hatred of people different from themselves, and today\u2019s ANTIFA do their evil deeds based on hate and a steady income from the Democrat Party, which has for a long time hired unemployed union members and out-of-work derelicts to threaten, beat people and burn things, and most recently to cause trouble for anyone involved in the Trump presidential campaign or any person who is a supporter of President Trump\u2019s administration. Hoods are hoods and violence is violence, no matter how close they are to Hillary Clinton, Maxine Waters, Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the rest of the Democrat underground. And in fact, these ladies are the enablers of domestic destruction and terrorist actions via their bought-and-paid-for ANTIFA terrorist organization.

{"text":"Donald Trump is lying about DACA immigration policy: President Donald Trump.YouTube While President Trump blames the Democrats for the DACA progams demise it was he who announced its end holding it hostage to get agreement on his terms. President Trump has been hammering the Democratic Party leadership and blaming them for the imminent demise of DACA, the program that allows immigrants brought here as children to stay legally. According to Trump\u2019s trumped up version of events, several times he has offered a deal to keep DACA in return for concessions on admitting fewer legal immigrants and building a wall on the Mexican border. What Trump neglects to mention is that he alone decided to imperil DACA by announcing he was ending it by March 5, which if course he did not do. He instead has been using DACA as a Sword of Damocles over Democrats, warning he will end it if they don\u2019t come to the table on his terms.  DACA is dead because the Democrats didn\u2019t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon... No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2018  Democrats have rightly refused to be rolled on the issue, pointing out very clearly that DACA was doing just fine until Trump placed it in peril. Polls show that over 80 percent of Americans believe that the DACA kids, many of whom were newborn or toddlers when they were brought to America, should be allowed stay. That wish for them to stay is the generous vision of America that so many Americans share. Instead, we get a narrow, twisted, devious president who tries to bargain with young lives. Read more: Undocumented Irishman brought to USA aged 12 faces deportation to Dublin Imagine you are a child of DACA who grew up in this great country, never learned your parent's language but built a career and life for yourself here. Now you are in deep danger of being snapped away by a president who sees you and all your fellow DACA recipients as an extendable piece of political theater. Shame on you President Trump. The lack of a generous vision and the urge to demonize other countries and communities has come as a shocking revelation to the majority of Americans. Trump is living proof that you can fool most of the people most of the time. He was never a good businessman no matter the boastful rhetoric. He went broke or his companies went broke five times. He ripped off students at Trump University, the make-believe college he made up. Indicative of the true Trump is the fact that teachers promised a photo op with Trump and got a cardboard cut out instead. We have a cardboard cutout president too, except this guy just gets more confused and dangerous every day. DACA is a perfect example of his inability to frame or make policy. Likewise with gun control where he first boasted about taking on the NRA, then ran for cover when they showed him how they made him president. Then there are the tawdry women that \u201cSpankie\u201d hung out with. He is not the first nor will he be the last womanizer in the White House but it is truly incredible how his evangelical, holier than thou multitudes of followers continue to support him. It seems the evangelicals are composed of a flock of Elmer Gantrys as much as their preachers who should bear the same name for their double standards and bitter hypocrisy. We Americans can hang on until the November elections and see retribution for this Potemkin White House run by a fake leader with no clue about what he is doing. The DACA kids, however, have no such opportunity. Their crisis is now and it looks certain to end badly. If there is a shred of humanity in this man called Trump he will allow them to stay -- but we won\u2019t be holding our breath.

If you do not have hands-on experience in the field, on the road, working with the miscreants of society, you don\u2019t know . . . Well, you know how that ends. In my experience, most people will react in a positive, if not a hesitant manner, with logical motivation, especially if you treat them with respect. However, there are those in a minority group of violent, repetitive thugs, criminals, animals that respect one thing, and only one thing. FEAR! You can try to conjole them, placate them into calm, and handle them with kid gloves to no avail. They do understand pepper spray, ASP, PR-24, Taser, and gunshot wounds. If you put fear into their heads, they will react with a certain amount of respect, usually in your favor. Sometimes, though, the only way to protect yourself from these animals is by shooting them in self-defense. When you have a rapist, pedophile, abusive spouse\/parent\/sibling\/child, armed robber, murderer, it is unlikely, if they have a history of these types of arrests, that they will ever result in a full and positive rehabilitation of their malevolent behavior. They tend to have children who have only that one (or both) miscreant parent(s); and, thus, the children use their parental models to become poorly adjusted and just as bad. How do you remove this type of behavior from society, with utmost reliability? There are several ways. They all involve the death of the individual(s). By rifle squad, guillotine, electric chair, toxic injection, or other form of termination (punishment for their actions). Consequently, does this seem uncivil? Unjustified? Inhuman? NO! Consider the inhuman treatment that these thugs have inflicted upon their victims, mostly women, children, helpless beings, and innocent ones. Therefore, is that more acceptable than the death of these animals? Moreover, I believe most people who are first responders, whether law enforcement officers, fire personnel, EMTs, even nurses and doctors, would agree that a sudden loss of incurable lives is better than the loss of all of those victims. As a result, it seems that the only people who find it worthy to invest in these thugs are inexperienced individuals or attorneys who profit by defending them over and over in appeal after appeal. Finally, let\u2019s stop the madness. Enforce or reinstate, if your state repealed the death penalty, the elimination of these reprobates. \u2013 Roger Bull, sergeant (ret.), Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office, author","label":1}

Jones was forced to apologize for pushing the Pizzagate conspiracy theory that claimed Hillary Clinton was involved in running a child sex ring in a pizza shop, which a man later shot up. President Trump has praised Jones, telling him, \u201cYour reputation is amazing. I will not let you down.\u201d The unhinged conspiracy goes even further, of course.

Shroyer asserted that the event happened at the library named after Michelle Obama because the former first lady is a transgender woman who used to be named \u201cMichael.\u201d \u201cWhy do you think Michelle Obama is having this at her library, folks? It\u2019s transsexual, OK. That\u2019s a man, or it was a man. No, it is a man.

{"text":"Why So Many #MeToo Feminists Are Hypocrites: Share Tweet Pin It Share Email Print I am a little confused by the #MeToo feminists who have stood by for years while they knew the famous \u201ccasting couch\u201d was in full swing \u2014 but wanted their time in the spotlight so badly they would endure whatever that entailed. For any of the glittering elite at the Golden Globes the other night who acquiesced, kept silent, and went on to embrace fame and fortune, you made your choice. You chose to sell your soul to get a shot at the apple. For all who have joined the #MeToo movement while pulling in millions for film work and living lavish lifestyles while thousands of other young women were forced through those same doors of degradation, your protests sound a little hollow. Check the roles you have played, and what those roles did to further the falsehood that women are sex objects and are only viable if they are \u201chot.\u201d Every show on HBO and now Netflix has the required soft-porn and dehumanizing-to-women scenes that validate it and put it on the level of \u201cacceptable art.\u201d All involved are congratulated and given little blocks of Lucite with inscriptions verifying that yes, indeed, they took part in the degradation of women. And it is all caught on film. [lz_ndn video=33408813] For decades the feminists have claimed that women are like men and have the same sexual drives and should have the right to satisfy those desires in the same way they have seen men do for years. They desired to embrace the worst elements of men while denying that which sets all women apart; they used to be worthy of the pedestals men would create for them. Just that concept alone was so disgusting for feminists that they moved to crash the pedestals, streak naked on campuses, burn bras, practice free love and ultimately protest to have the right to kill the offspring of those unions. Yippee, women. You \u201cbecame\u201d men. You insisted you be treated like men \u2014 and oh, that you were tough enough to take it. But if someone brushes against your backside, you cry. Related: Rose McGowan Slams Golden Globes\u2019 All-Black Attire By now, declaring that all unwanted touching, comments, looks, or even gestures should be reason enough to burn all men at the stake, you have declared your feminist movement a complete and total disaster. You are not real feminists because you didn\u2019t go into the director\u2019s office prepared for what you knew was going to happen. More from LifeZette You wanted that position so badly, you would do anything \u2014 even pose nude in your hero\u2019s porn mags. It was an honor that women would seek to be in the centerfold of Playboy. It was an icon of women power \u2014 or so you thought. It was men laughing all the way to the bedroom after they convinced women it would empower them. It\u2019s like men yelling the loudest for the right of women to kill the product of their unprotected sex. No skin off the guy\u2019s teeth. He\u2019ll just jump in bed with another clueless bimbo who must have missed all the sex ed classes that started in kindergarten. And has anyone ever seen the books they use to teach kids about sex? Talk about dehumanizing and degrading. Why weren\u2019t the mothers screaming about that? Oh, wait \u2014 they were. They were called prudes \u2014 and they were dismissed by the educational powers that be as obstacles to progress. They applauded then-President Bill Clinton for what he was doing with Monica Lewinsky \u2014 and declared that that sex act kept girls from becoming pregnant. Now that would be a legitimate #MeToo movement \u2014 all the young girls who were shamed by these classes, harassed by sexually active pubescents and made to feel abnormal if they joined abstinence groups and pledged to save themselves for marriage. They were mocked, ridiculed, shamed, and in some cases attacked and molested for their principled stance. If these feminists really do believe that sexual harassment should not be tolerated at any level, then let\u2019s see them move to take all sex out of every movie and TV show. Suggest that no act of violence against a woman should ever be tolerated. That would pretty much cut the run time of any \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d episode in half. It\u2019s the women with money and power in the industry who tolerate all this. Don\u2019t just wear your sexy and revealing black dress, telling us you are so righteous on this issue \u2014 when most of you have committed the sin of allowing yourselves to be in a position for roles that show women in degrading or humiliating positions. Talk is cheap \u2014 and as a woman, I have fought my whole life to speak for myself and let men know these women do not, and have never, spoken for me. They have tried to silence women like me because we don\u2019t embrace their flawed political ideals. We don\u2019t swoon at their leftist and social views while they claim to care about the poor but live in gated communities to protect themselves from them.  As a woman, I have fought my whole life to speak for myself and let men know these women do not, and have never, spoken for me.  Oh, sure, they\u2019ll let them in to clean their toilets or drive their cars or cut their grass. But they have nothing in common with the poor; and those who came through that economic strata do everything they can to separate themselves from it while pushing failed socialist agendas on them. These women are about groupthink, and the destruction of the individual. They will bully, with their magical pulpit, any who disagree or oppose them. They have great power and wield it effectively, which suggests that they always had the power to say no, to reject the job offer, to turn down the promotion or raise or to just say \u201cbuzz off\u201d to any man who would say, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I want to do to you.\u201d Here\u2019s another good #MeToo movement. How many women have been dismissed, marginalized, disrespected and\/or abused because of their political stance, their faith, their political party? Oh, let\u2019s see: There was Sarah Palin, Phyllis Schlafly, Stacey Dash, Beverly LaHaye, Paula Jones, Ann Coulter, Kathleen Wiley, Condi Rice, Juanita Broderick, Dana Loesch, Mia Love, Kellyanne Conway, and Sarah Sanders. Anyone see a pattern here at all? The #MeToo feminists embraced the women\u2019s movement with glee knowing they were giving men more power over them \u2014 in so many ways. How many decades of Cosmo covers talked about women\u2019s orgasms and the 10 billion ways to service or please a man? Seriously? These women can\u2019t stand there pleading innocence and virtue when they were fanning the flames of sexual abuse. They started it \u2014 and now they want the rest of us to finish it while blaming all men for it. Here\u2019s how you finish it, Hollywood: Stop making movies that show women nude or having sex or being abused or having their tops ripped off, or whatever. You know the movies. And women in black: Cover up your breasts, stop strutting in the long-slitted skirts, pull up the plunge lines, and look up the word \u201cmodest.\u201d And men: There\u2019s not much to say here \u2014 since men have only been doing what men have done since the beginning of time. The only difference is, the feminists gave them permission to do it. So in the words of Barack Obama: \u201cGet off your high horses.\u201d Nina May is a writer, producer and director, and currently the showrunner on \u201cDaily Bread,\u201d a faith-based post-apocalyptic drama.","label":1}

Those who considered themselves patriots condemned Kaepernick\u2019s behavior. Others agreed with Kaepernick, and argued that was not protesting America itself, but the killing of unarmed black men across the country at the hands of police. Still, many former and current military members found it extremely disrespectful, no matter what message Kaepernick was championing. The issue was so volatile that a lot of people think it cost Kaepernick a roster spot. His skill level may be higher than other backups across the league \u2014 the man played in a Super Bowl after all \u2014 but most owners don\u2019t seem to want the extra media attention paid to a backup quarterback. TRENDING: Broke Mom on Last $20, Kids Pray to God for Miracle. Then Finds Envelope with Check on Doorstep Just because Kapernick isn\u2019t in the league doesn\u2019t mean the issue is over. Protests have been erupting in St. Louis after an officer was found not guilty of first-degree murder. In Cahokia, Illinois, these protests prompted a team of 8-year-old football players to ask their coach about what was happening. When he asked the player why he thought people were protesting, the player responded by saying, \u201cBecause black people are getting killed and nobody\u2019s going to jail.\u201d This prompted Coach Orlando Gooden to talk about peaceful protests, specifically related to football. He told his kids about Colin Kaepernick, and they responded by saying, \u201cCan we do that?\u201d \u201cI told them kneeling is a show of respect, not for those who broke boundaries \u2014 I support only peaceful protest \u2014 but for the innocent lives that have been touched by injustice,\u201d Gooden told CBS. \u201cI know some of the people talk and speak as if I told the kids to turn around and that. I didn\u2019t.\u201d So, at the next game, the team all took a knee when the national anthem started. The parents of the team seemed to be on board, but not everyone felt that way. Coach Gooden was hit with a wave of criticism from individuals and the media, saying that he was getting the children mixed up in something they didn\u2019t fully understand. Brian Kilmeade of \u201cFox and Friends\u201d even went so far as to say, \u201cYou\u2019re never too young to disrespect the country.\u201d \u201cWhat I teach my kids is love, integrity, honesty, fairness, respect and boundaries,\u201d Gooden said. \u201cAs long as I have support of my parents and team, I\u2019m perfectly fine, and I\u2019m covered under the First Amendment to peacefully protest and assemble.\u201d All of this brings to mind a story we covered last year, about a high school team that travels with an American flag. Instead of kneeling, this team chose to bring the patriotism on the road with them. When the team came to a rival school, they noticed there was no flag hanging. They grabbed their road-flag off their bus, and brought it to the field for the national anthem. It was clear that this team understood the importance of patriotism, with one young man saying, \u201cPeople die to protect their country and for the flag. People are disrespecting it all the time.

{"text":"Total number of Americans hurt in Cuba sonic attacks now at 25: HAVANA, Cuba - According to sources familiar with the investigation, the number of Americans hurt in the alleged \"sonic device\" attacks has now reached 25, with some cases still pending ongoing testing, which could increase that number. Sources who want to remain anonymous also revealed new information, telling Local 10 News reporter Hatzel Vela some of the incidents happened inside the embassy itself and at multiple Havana hotels, including the famous Nacional Hotel. Up to this point, it has been reported victims were attacked near or outside their Havana homes, and one of the victims was attacked at Havana's Hotel Capri in the Vedado neighborhood. In light of the attacks and ongoing investigation, the U.S. government is reportedly close to making a decision to possibly suspend operations in Havana. On Sept. 17, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the U.S. government was reviewing whether or not to close down the American embassy in Havana. \"We have it under evaluation,\" Tillerson said. \"It's a very serious issue with respect to the harm that certain individuals have suffered.\" Sources told Local 10 News there is great discontent among the victims, who remain disappointed at the way the U.S. government handled the situation. Their major complain is that it took too long for high ranking officials in Havana and Washington to take action. Over the weekend, CNN reported diplomats and their families have been attacked nearly 50 times. On Monday, the same day this story was published, Cuban state-run media printed a report in which an unnamed high-ranking Cuban official said Cuba does not have the sort of equipment that can be used for this type of attack. The report adds Cuba doesn't have precedent with this type of attack. On Friday, Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, while addressing the United Nations, once again denied responsibility and added the Cuban government complies with its obligations to protect all diplomats on the island. \"Cuba has never perpetrated, nor will it ever perpetrate, actions of this sort,\" Rodriguez said. \"Cuba has never allowed, nor will it ever allow, its territory to be used by third parties with that purpose.\" Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez speaks to the United Nations. Rodriguez added results from a preliminary investigation being conducted at the highest level of his government, which includes U.S. supplied data, up to this point shows no evidence that confirms a cause or origin related to the health issues being reported by the American diplomats and their families. \"The investigation to clarify this issue continues, and in order to be able to arrive to a conclusion, it will be crucial to count on the cooperation of the U.S. authorities,\" Rodriguez said. \"It would be unfortunate if a matter of this nature is politicized.\" On Sept. 15, The Associated Press reported Cuba's President Raul Castro was so rattled by what's happening, he sent for the top American envoy in the country to address grave concerns about the attacks. The way Castro responded surprised Washington, several U.S. officials familiar with the exchange told The Associated Press. In a rare face-to-face conversation, Castro told U.S. diplomat Jeffrey DeLaurentis that he was equally baffled and concerned. Castro denied any responsibility. The Cubans have allowed several investigative agencies, including the FBI, to spend time on the communist-run island and seek out answers. In a country tightly controlled by the government, Americans investigators are still looking into whether a rogue faction in Cuba's security forces acted in defiance with the Castro government and possibly collaborated with another country, like Russia. On Aug. 23, Local 10 News was the first media outlet in the country to report that there could be up to 19 victims. Days later, the State Department confirmed those numbers and subsequently increased the number of victims to 21. Canadian diplomats have suffered similar health problems and believe they were victims of similar attacks. Back in August, Local 10 News also learned some of the victims were treated at the University of Miami by a doctor who specializes in ear and brain damage. There is a history of American diplomats being harassed while working in Havana, but never this severe. While living and working in Havana, some of these same victims of \"sonic attacks\" were constantly under overt surveillance. Their cars were vandalized, phones tapped, homes broken into, human waste left in toilets, their clothing soaked in urine and pets even poisoned.

{"text":"Charlie Sykes: Conservative Media Provides Trump Supporters a \u2018Safe Space\u2019 From the Truth: Mediaite columnist John Ziegler spoke to Charlie Sykes this weekend, and the conservative former radio host offered some mocking commentary about people who sacrifice their credibility to always defend President Trump. During the 2016 election, Sykes was a vocal Never-Trump conservative who worried that Trump\u2019s political rise would have dire long-term consequences for the GOP and the country at large. Sykes currently works as an MSNBC contributor, and he frequently criticizes right-wing figures who display ideological hypocrisy by dismissing the president\u2019s controversies. Sykes was on to promote his new book \u2013 How the Right Lost It\u2019s Mind \u2013 which explores how Trump came to embody the decline of traditional Republican thinking. The piece also considers how certain flaws within the conservative movement and made it possible for someone like Trump to ascend to the White House.  \u201cI always knew there were the fringe characters, but I always believed the center would hold. I always believed we would ultimately do the rational, reasonable, principled thing, which was obviously, in retrospect, highly na\u00efve.\u201d  Ziegler and Sykes proceeded to discuss how conspiracy theorists and false demagoguery became mainstream viewpoints among the right. Skyes called this phenomenon a \u201ccancer,\u201d and he figured that Trump was able to normalize this and harness momentum by creating a campaign to mimic their rhetoric. As the conversation continued, Sykes said it has become \u201cso evident\u201d conservative talk radio is a media business designed to pursue ratings over any ideological cause. He argued that people like Rush Limbaugh followed the shifting views of their audience, while Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity is \u201cdumb as a box of rocks\u201d and one of those who would predictably cave in to Trump. Eventually, Ziegler noted how often people tune out various media figures so they can pay attention to those who provide them with information that reinforces their worldview. Sykes agreed with Ziegler on this topic, and he compared the situation to conservatives who make fun of the idea of safe spaces.  \u201cOne of the things I realized was that the we conservatives have mocked the Left, I think legitimately, for safe spaces on university campuses. But the conservative audience really came to think of conservative talk radio, conservative media as their safe space, where they were not going to be confronted with the inconvenient truths, where they weren\u2019t going to have to eat the broccoli. And anyone who fed them the broccoli, anyone who told them things that were disturbing or off message, got a lot of pushback.\u201d  Sykes went on to lament that there were no more ideological standards or cultural footholds conservatives could rely on after falling in line behind Trump. He continued to express concerns that the current toxic political atmosphere will have negative repercussions around the country Listen above, via Free Speech Broadcasting.

As reported by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper this afternoon, the trickster posed as Weinstein to fool his former adviser Lisa Bloom, who recently dropped out from representing Weinstein following quite a bit of criticism tossed her way. In the email exchange on Sunday, the fake Weinstein told the real Bloom that he understood why she had to leave his team. She responded by telling the prankster that she was unaware of the more serious allegations against Weinstein. When the fake Weinstein asked what those allegations were, Bloom merely said \u201csexual assault.\u201d This email exchange all took place before the New Yorker published its bombshell report earlier today that alleged Weinstein had raped three women. Weinstein himself was also fooled by the prankster. The trickster posed as Anita Dunn and, after receiving an email from Weinstein in which he said he was sick and needed advice, replied that redemption could be found only if he was \u201cwilling to be as brave as those who found the strength to stand up to you.\u201d The fake Dunn added that Weinstein needed to accept his fate graciously and not look to \u201cdiscredit those who your behavior has affected.\u201d Weinstein responded by saying he agreed. \u201cThat agreement notwithstanding, Weinstein\u2019s attorneys and spokespeople have been doing the opposite of that,\u201d Tapper noted. \u201cThey\u2019ve been denying the allegations, and as obtained by journalist Janice Min, Weinstein himself has been writing and reaching out privately to Hollywood CEOs and moguls asking them to defend him.\u201d Watch the clip above, via CNN.

Do Better!\u2019: share link Visit TODAY.com for the latest news, videos, easy recipes, inspiring stories and more. Earlier this week, actress Rose McGowan was temporarily suspendedfrom Twitter after she unleashed a series of tweets about the Harvey Weinstein scandal. The suspension came after she called out Ben Affleck and others for providing cover for Weinstein\u2019s sexual misconduct. The social media platform stated that McGowan was suspended for violating its rule of publicly sharing personal phone numbers. Considering McGowan \u2014 who has accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting her \u2014 is one of the leading voices bringing the movie producer\u2019s history of sexual misconduct to light, the suspension was a PR disaster for Twitter, to say the least. During today\u2019s broadcast of Megyn Kelly Today, host Megyn Kelly lit into Twitter over its decision while pointing to her own history of being harassed online as proof the platform is inconsistent in applying its rules. Highlighting that it is against the site\u2019s rules to share phone numbers, Kelly noted that it also violates Twitter\u2019s policy to incite harassment or to directly threaten people, jokingly asking the audience if they knew someone who did that in an obvious nod to the president.

{"text":"NBC News Prez: \u2018Deeply Offensive\u2019 to Suggest We Covered Up for Weinstein: NBC News is defending itself against criticism that they dropped the ball on the Harvey Weinstein story by allowing Ronan Farrow \u2014 a correspondent for the network \u2014 to publish his reporting in The New Yorker rather than air it on one of their platforms. At a town hall forum in New York Wednesday (in remarks quoted via The Hollywood Reporter), NBC News president Noah Oppenheim said that everyone at the company can hold their heads high over their actions on the Weinstein investigation \u2014 which Oppenheim said was initially reported for the network. \u201c[I]t would pain all of us who were involved in that, and involved in investigations, if anyone at this organization, thought there was anything to be ashamed of in that decision making process,\u201d Oppenheim said. \u201cIn fact, quite the contrary.\u201d Oppenheim said that Farrow was given resources and \u201cmany, many months\u201d to report the story, but couldn\u2019t bring it in for a landing. Last summer, Oppenheim said the network made the decision to pull the plug. But Farrow wanted to keep chasing it, so he continued the project for The New Yorker, where he eventually published his findings on Tuesday. \u201cThe notion that we would try to cover for a powerful person is deeply offensive to all of us,\u201d Oppenheim said. On Tuesday, Farrow told Rachel Maddow that he disagreed with the multiple assessments at NBC that the story was not reportable. \u201cI walked into the door at The New Yorker with an explosive reportable piece that should have been public earlier and immediately obviously The New Yorker recognized that and it is not accurate to say that it was not reportable,\u201d Farrow said. \u201cIn fact, there were multiple determinations that it was reportable at NBC.\u201d What remains unclear from the Oppenheim statement is why Farrow had to be taken off of the story during the summer. Was there another time-sensitive project that NBC needed him on? If they had invested \u201cmany, many months\u201d on the Weinstein project, why completely take him off a story that he only planned to pursue elsewhere anyway? Questions certainly remain.

{"text":"Gun Control Advocates Cannot Win Without Fighting Their Own Racism [OPINION]: On Sunday (October 1), a 64-year-old White man named Stephen Paddock opened fire from a Las Vegas hotel room window, shooting into the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival and later killing himself. With at least 59 people killed and 527 wounded as of press time, this mass shooting surpasses the 2016 Pulse nightclub massacre as the country\u2019s deadliest shooting by a single triggerman. Just like Pulse and other mass shootings before it, the aftermath of this tragedy is following a time-honored template: Law enforcement rushes to confirm or reject the assailant as a \u201c terrorist\u201d (read: Muslim, Brown-skinned). The Islamic State plays on our Islamophobia by claiming dubious responsibility. Mainstream media outlets follow every new development, treating each revelation about the shooter\u2019s weapons stash, motive and music preferences with the same unrelenting morbid curiosity. Their headlines blast all-caps superlatives like \u201cWORST\u201d and \u201cDEADLIEST\u201d with zero context. The thousands of Native and African Americans that White people slaughtered in Tulsa, Wounded Knee and countless other places don\u2019t even register in their majority-White panel discussions. Moreover, their coverage unfailingly grants White shooters a narrative complexity (Was he a loner? What was his childhood like?) in death that they never give Black victims of police violence or the people who loved them (Did she provoke the officer? Why wouldn\u2019t she just comply? Why did her second cousin steal that candy bar 10 years ago?). Of course, politicians of all leanings send their \u201c thoughts and prayers\u201d to the victims, calling on the same higher power many conveniently forget when taking gun lobby money. And don\u2019t forget the rush to pathologize White shooters. This time around, President Donald Trump is alleging that the shooter suffered from mental illness, and outlets are reporting that he was on anti-anxiety medication that could have caused him to act aggressively. If your social media feeds look anything like mine, this Groundhog Day of a post-massacre cycle includes one other crucial aspect: critics, often liberal ones, who demand their legislators fight the National Rifle Association\u2019s ( NRA) lobbying power and impose gun control measures. They say things like, \u201cWe need action, not prayers,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t get why anybody owns a gun.\u201d These arguments don\u2019t endear the critics to Second Amendment groups and supporters who use deliberate and racist fearmongering to justify legalized assault rifles. But more importantly, they conceal the far more insidious racism lurking within their own beliefs. They say that gun control makes us safer without acknowledging why Black gun ownership rates grew over the past five years, especially after the election of Donald Trump. And their push for a nation without guns will fail, as it always does, unless they address two dangerous blind spots: Most gun control measures rely on law enforcement that people of color rightfully don\u2019t trust. MC and political activist Michael \u201c Killer Mike\u201d Render once defended the Second Amendment by saying, \u201cI represent a group of people who are being killed by the people who their tax money pays.\u201d Mike certainly doesn\u2019t represent all left-leaning Black activists, but his statement addresses something that too many gun control advocates ignore. While gun-toting White racists threaten communities of color with an unyielding frequency, one of the biggest daily threats\u2014particularly for African and Native Americans\u2014comes from law enforcement. That threat existed when early U.S. municipalities first created police departments to recapture the enslaved, and it continues today, when they are killed at disproportionately high rates. Most contemporary gun control legislation doesn\u2019t stop police departments of all sizes from arming themselves to the teeth, greeting Black protesters with military-grade weapons and tactics, calling on the actual military to suppress pushback to their policing or appropriating activist chants while violently claiming public spaces for themselves. It does, however, allow these agencies explicit authority to enforce who can have what guns. Last year, it relied on terror watch lists that target people of color to determine that ownership. We cannot tell communities of color to trust law enforcement agencies\u2014who don\u2019t intervene when White supremacists fire into crowds or take racists to Burger King after arresting them for killing Black churchgoers\u2014to protect them from mass shooters. They already have and exercise the means to kill people of color en masse. Gun control measures did work\u2014just not against White shooters. The NRA\u2019s current pro-Second Amendment stance contrasts with its previous support for gun control measures. The group successfully lobbied for both California\u2019s Mulford Act of 1967 and its federal successor, the Gun Control Act of 1968. So it\u2019s clear that the NRA can understand why certain people shouldn\u2019t access assault rifles, machine guns or other mass murder-primed arms. But to the NRA, \u201ccertain people\u201d originally meant Black activists. The Mulford Act came barely two months after Black Panther Party members staged an open-carry demonstration at the California state capitol. The legislation repealed part of the state\u2019s Penal Code 12031, which allowed people to carry loaded weapons\u2014as the Panthers did while patrolling Black neighborhoods to ward off police abuse\u2014as long as they were in the open. The Panthers still believed in guns, but without the law\u2019s protection, other armed groups\u2014like the Los Angeles Police Department\u2014had legal authority to shoot up Party headquarters. Repression like what the Panthers faced dates back to the antebellum period, when state laws prohibited people who were enslaved from even touching guns without a White supervisor. Free African Americans who owned guns risked seizure and violent punishment by White so-called \u201c citizen patrols.\u201d The end of the Civil War brought no relief as White supremacist governments enacted Black codes that effectively outlawed Black gun ownership. Founded in 1871, the NRA did not participate in these gun ownership debates for much of its early history. That changed in 1926, when NRA president Karl Fredrick responded to perceptions of gun violence in immigrant communities by drafting legislation to restrict concealed carry practices. The organization then embarked on a gun control mission that primarily impacted people of color (including immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, who had yet to be deemed \u201cWhite\u201d). Thirty years later, the NRA was silent when the state of Alabama denied Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. a concealed carry permit after his house was firebombed. Decades later, the NRA is true to form, saying nothing when Black legal gunowners like Philando Castile are shot dead by police. Instead, it chooses to demonize unarmed activists who are fighting for equity as the real threat. Gun control in America won\u2019t work for all Americans unless advocates push to demilitarize police departments and advance measures that don\u2019t disproportionately impact people of color. Gun control reform that does not go this route will end in laws that further empower police to seize weapons and use them against whomever they choose. History shows who they\u2019ll target first.","label":1}

{"text":"Why Aren't Fully Automatic Guns Illegal? Las Vegas Has Extremely Permissive Firearm Laws: ALFREDO ESTRELLA\/AFP\/Getty Images On Sunday night, a gunman opened fire on concertgoers in Las Vegas killing at least 50 people and injuring hundreds. It's the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, with the gunman firing from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel into a music festival on the ground. According to reports, that a \"cache of weapons,\" including 10 rifles, was found in the shooter's room after the attack. Knowing that, people may wonder why aren't fully automatic guns illegal? Their ability to quickly and fatally wound hordes of people at once makes these type of weapons extremely dangerous. Las Vegas and the state of Nevada have some of the most permissive gun laws around. Per Newsweek, Nevada's lax gun laws include that firearms owners don't need licenses, don't need to register their guns, and can own as many as they like. The outlet also reported that \"automatic assault weapons and machine guns are also legal in the state as long as they are registered and are possessed in adherence to federal law, according to theNational Rifle Association.\" In addition, gun-owners in the state may carry weapons openly without a permit and can also get a license to carry concealed. Guns with high-capacity magazines are allowed. CNN law enforcement analyst James Gagliano told the outlet in the aforementioned article just how much damage weapons like that can do.  Automatic weapon(s) like that \u2014 had to be numbers of magazines or a very large drum, it sounded to me like a belt-fed weapon, a military-style weapon and then to be shooting down, to use the analogy, it was like shooting fish in a barrel in that space.  With such a horrific metaphor as that, it's hard to understand why fully automatic weapons, capable of so much damage, aren't illegal; the reason why is filled with so many loopholes that stop people from being safe if the weapon is in the wrong hands. According to Daily Kos, it's not illegal for people to own military grade machine guns or other fully automatic guns, but \"ownership of these weapons is restricted.\" But here \"restricted\" is not as much as you may think: While most average people are seemingly limited from their ability to own these weapons, there are numerous loopholes. Citizens, gun dealers, and gun ranges cannot buy new machine guns, but those purchased prior to 1986 still exist and are traded around \u2014 in fact, as Daily Kos reported, \"There's about one machine gun for every 1,000 Americans.\" As is often the case after a gun-related tragedy like this, gun control becomes a hot topic. Those against laws that allow open carry, machine gun ownership, and unlicensed firearm owning are quick to speak up that events like these show that the country needs more gun control laws. Those on the opposite side, those who are vocal about the right to bear arms, will loudly disagree. It's the same every time, and there are entirely too many tragedies like this one that spark this kind of debate \u2014 all the while nothing changes. As the situation in Las Vegas is an ongoing investigation, it isn't fully known why the shooter committed this act, or how many weapons and what type were used, nor who owned them and whether it was legally or not. All of that will be discovered in time, and it's best to not rush to judgement about whether Nevada's lax gun laws are to blame. Still, the bottom line is that this event did start up the conversation once more, and also drew attention to the permissive laws on the books in Nevada. Perhaps this attention will push lawmakers to change things for the future. Or, maybe things will stay exactly the same. But, as tiresome as this conversation can be \u2014 as it's been had so many times \u2014 it's an important one, and it will likely wage on in the days and weeks to come. Only time will tell if anything changes this time. Here are some ways you can help the victims in Las Vegas.","label":0}
{"text":"Hillary: \u201cShocked and appalled\u201d by Weinstein \u2026 now: Five days after the New York Times exposed Harvey Weinstein\u2019s predatory behavior, Hillary Clinton is finally all over it. In a statement released just thirty minutes ago, Hillary proclaims herself \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d by claims pouring out from multiple media outlets about Weinstein\u2019s decades-long sexual harassment and worse. Notably, she says nothing about the hundreds of thousands of dollars Weinstein raised for her and Bill and the Democratic Party over the last quarter-century:  JUST IN: Hillary Clinton releases statement on Harvey Weinstein allegations pic.twitter.com\/evarlP4q9B \u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) October 10, 2017  Funny, Hillary Clinton spoke last night at UC Davis for an hour and a half, and didn\u2019t see fit to remark on her status as \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d at all. The candidate who lost to Donald Trump in last year\u2019s presidential race complained about his climate-change policies, blamed a recent spate of hurricanes and wildfires on global warming, promoted protests by NFL players during the national anthem, and promoted her book What Happened. What didn\u2019t happen was Hillary mentioning her Hollywood pal and fundraiser Harvey Weinstein, despite having run on a platform of lifting up women and protecting them from the Harvey Weinsteins of the world. At least her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), has decided to declare Weinstein\u2019s actions as \u201clow-life behavior.\u201d CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota wonders when anyone will hear that from Hillary. Kaine dodged at first by saying he\u2019s a Senator, not a press secretary, and then suggested that Hillary would get around to it in her own time. Eventually. Maybe:  \u201cHillary Clinton spoke for 90 minutes last night in California. But she didn\u2019t mention Harvey Weinstein,\u201d noted \u201cNew Day\u201d co-anchor Alisyn Camerota. \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cLook, you know, Alisyn, I\u2019m nobody\u2019s press secretary. I\u2019m a U.S. senator and I\u2019m telling you that sexual harassment is unacceptable. And I really think it\u2019s low-life behavior,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cHillary Clinton speaks out against sexual harassment often. And I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll have a word to say when the time is right for her. But I don\u2019t \u2014 you know, I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not anybody\u2019s press secretary,\u201d he added.  In case you were wondering, Kaine\u2019s not a press secretary. But then again, Kaine says any leader should be out front in condemning Weinstein\u2019s behavior:  \u201cBut you would recommend that she do that,\u201d Camerota followed. \u201cAny leader, any leader should condemn this,\u201d Kaine replied. \u201cI mean, I have a 22-year-old daughter who is starting off, you know, in the work world. And I \u2014 when you read the stories about young women feeling pressured by somebody in a position of power, it makes you sick.\u201d  That only amplifies Camerota\u2019s point. Hillary had a 90-minute platform last night at UC Davis, hardly a bastion of counter-progressive thought. She couldn\u2019t spare a single moment to say something like, \u201cHey, that Harvey Weinstein really turned out to be a pig, eh?\u201d Nothing? So much for being a leader on women\u2019s issues. Not that Hillary was alone in her silence, at least up to now. Hollywood had mostly kept its mouth shut, especially its male stars, but George Clooney was the early exception to that rule, to his credit. In an interview with The Daily Beast\u2019s Marlow Stern, Clooney says that he doubts that Democratic politicians knew much about Weinstein\u2019s activities; Clooney himself was only aware of rumors of womanizing, not abuse. Calling Weinstein \u201cindefensible,\u201d Clooney called on Democrats to return all of their Weinstein money pronto:  \u201cIt\u2019s indefensible. That\u2019s the only word you can start with,\u201d he says. \u201cHarvey\u2019s admitted to it, and it\u2019s indefensible. I\u2019ve known Harvey for 20 years. He gave me my first big break as an actor in films on From Dusk Till Dawn, he gave me my first big break as a director with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. We\u2019ve had dinners, we\u2019ve been on location together, we\u2019ve had arguments. But I can tell you that I\u2019ve never seen any of this behavior\u2014ever.\u201d \u2026 This is an interesting moment. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people, from Meryl [Streep] to Judi Dench, come out and say \u201choly shit,\u201d and I think that that\u2019s been the reaction by a lot of people in Hollywood. I don\u2019t think that people were looking the other way; I think that people weren\u2019t looking, because in some ways, a lecherous guy with money picking up younger girls is unfortunately not a news story in our society.  That\u2019s \u2026 not entirely true, at least apart from Clooney himself. He seems to be pretty honest about his own perspective, but Jessica Chastain tweeted out yesterday that \u201cthe stories were everywhere\u201d about Weinstein, and that she was warned about interacting with him at all:  I was warned from the beginning. The stories were everywhere. To deny that is to create an enviornment for it to happen again. \u2014 Jessica Chastain (@jes_chastain) October 9, 2017  When confronted about why Chastain didn\u2019t blow the whistle herself, the answer didn\u2019t impress her followers:  We hear this same story. Someone could have said something, but didn't bc reasons. Try 2 be as brave IRL as u are in the movies. \u2014 Chica'sBailBonds (@irinamoises) October 10, 2017  It looks like more of a case of not wanting to know for Clooney and others. Some other male stars have come forward today, including Ben Affleck, to denounce Weinstein but still claiming that they knew nothing. (Gwyneth Paltrow today hailed Brad Pitt for defending her from Weinstein two decades ago, but failed to note that it means Pitt knew and said nothing.) Clooney wants the DNC to cough up the cash now that everyone knows:  So when you find out how much worse it is than you thought, then it\u2019s a news story. And this is a big news story now. And I feel very bad for all of the victims. I mean, cornering a young anchorwoman in the kitchen and jerking off into a potted plant? That\u2019s not just some rumor about Harvey hitting on a woman; it\u2019s disturbing on a whole lot of levels, because there had to be a lot of people involved in covering that up. That\u2019s frustrating. If politicians knew these stories, I doubt they\u2019d have been taking donations from him at the DNC [Democratic National Committee], and I hope that they will all give the money back or donate it to good causes.  Well, they are donating to what they see as good causes. Primarily, that means other organizations that work to elect Democrats:  Other major beneficiaries of the Weinstein family\u2019s largesse included almost $200,000 to the party\u2019s Senate campaign accounts, $23,200 to its House campaign arm senatorial and $46,350 to Hillary Clinton, the 2016 presidential candidate, and to HILLPAC, a committee Clinton used to support other Democrats while senator. The figures include contributions attributed to Weinstein, first wife Eve Chilton and current spouse Georgina Chapman. \u2026 The biggest beneficiary of funds from Weinstein and his family was the Democratic National Committee, which received about $800,000 in several of its accounts, according to the center, which analyzes political spending. Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said the party plans to give more than $30,000 to Emily\u2019s List, Emerge America and Higher Heights. All three groups work to elect women to office. Hinojosa said the amount was for the funds Weinstein himself donated to the party during the 2016 campaign.  That\u2019s not donating as much as it is money laundering. But at least they\u2019re acknowledging their connections to Weinstein. The Leader of All Women couldn\u2019t manage even that much, until media outlets began openly reporting her deafening silence.","label":1}
{"text":"Incited by Pelosi, Antifa Forces Moderate Republican to Run for His Life in Berkeley: A young conservative activist who denounces racism and white supremacy was chased down the streets of Berkeley today, fearing for his life, by the \"anti-fascist\" group Antifa, after being tagged in a press release from Nancy Pelosi as a \"white supremacist.\" In dramatic footage Joey Gibson can be seen at first backing away, then running, from a swarm of black-clad, masked Antifa members brandishing clubs and weapons, one of whom strikes Gibson as he hops over a concrete barrier. The Southern Poverty Law Center as well as the Anti-Defamation League have both supported Gibson, founder of Patriot Prayer, in his objection to being called a racist or white supremacist. Gibson has strongly condemned white supremacists, both in general and by name, and most of the speakers at his rallies are usually African-America, Latino, or Asian. One who was scheduled to speak at a rally in San Francisco last Saturday is transgender. Gibson has also said he rejects anti-Muslim Islamophobia. He supports robust free speech, and constantly challenges the Antifa activists to debate him. Nevertheless, the Anti-Defamation League, as well as various media, go on to paint Gibson and Patriot Prayer as \"Alt-Right,\" \"Alt-Lite,\" or \"Far-Right,\" while denying they are racists, using nebulous terms with the common characteristic that the ralliers are generally Trump supporters. After Gibson had cancelled the Patriot Prayer rally on Saturday, he posted on the group's Facebook that he would be on the streets of Berkeley on Sunday seeking to conduct a dialogue with \"normal people.\" Gibson has described his mission as an effort to \"unite moderates,\" rejecting \"extremists\" of both the left and the right, and to restore civility and \"respect\" in political dialogue. When Patriot Prayer announced it's rally in San Francisco earlier this month, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Minority Leader and a former Speaker of the House, put out a press release which branded Gibson and Patriot Prayer as \"white supremacists.\" Media coverage ensued repeating the description. Antifa is the self-styled \"anti-fascist\" group organized by the umbrella organization Refuse Fascism. Antifa activists had already expressed a desire to kill Gibson, who denounces Marxist ideology as well as Nazism and fascism. On Sunday, Antifa hunted Gibson on the streets of Berkeley. Gibson was reported to have been arrested in Berkeley, but the Patriot Prayer Facebook reports this is not true. Gibson was handcuffed briefly when he charged through police lines to escape an Antifa mob but was then released. A review of Gibson's publicly posted videos and speeches confirms that he has never been known to make a racist or white supremacist statement, and in fact spends quite a bit of time, as a Japanese-American, denouncing these very ideologies. Nevertheless, the group Antifa, in its literature and public record, makes no distinction between \"fascists,\" \"white supremacists,\" \"Nazis,\" \"Alt-Right,\" \"Far-Right,\" and Trump supporters. Antifa poster equating all Trump supporters with World War II Nazis. A similar conservative-leaning rally in Boston last week opened with a moment of silence for Heather Heyer, the woman killed in Charlottesville last month by a white supremacist. Many participants in the Boston conservative rally were not white, including the keynote speaker, Republican candidate for US Senate Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai. As the candidate spoke, supporters held up his campaign signs, which read \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"No to GMO.\" Nevertheless, the Boston local media reported the gathering as one of white supremacists, spurring a massive counter-protest of 40,000 people, including Antifa activists who caused the rally to be shut down early. A massive police presence was deployed in Boston to protect the conservative ralliers from harm. Boston pro-Trump rally. Boston pro-Trump rally With even the LA Times declining to call Patriot Prayer \"white supremacists\" or adherents of any other racist ideology, the only label which stuck was that they were Trump supporters. Only one of the scheduled speakers in Gibson's cancelled Saturday rally was white. Two rap bands made up of African-Americans were to be in the entertainment.","label":1}

The irrational and irrelevant Herr Fuerher Trump is a punk who terrorizes for political power. He knows the Russian investigation is getting closer to him and will do anything to suppress free speech because it is getting to be incessantly against him. Herr Fuerher Trump\u2019s fellow Neo-Nazi base loved him ending DACA. The article \u201cTrump appeals to his cheering base with end to \u2018special rights\u2019 for \u2018Dreamers\u2019\u201d states \u201cWhile President Trump\u2019s opponents took to the streets Tuesday to protest his decision to end Obama-era protections for young undocumented immigrants, his core supporters loved it. Politically, Trump\u2019s decision Tuesday to rescind the 5-year-old Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was a valentine to his base, the 39 percent of Americans who approve of the job he\u2019s been doing and for whom immigration is a driving issue.\u201d The article \u201cCNN's Brinkley: '10-15%' Of Trump's Supporters Are KKK, White Nationalists, Alt-Right\u201d states \u201cAccording to historian, professor of history, and CNN contributor, Douglas Brinkley, 10-15% of President Donald Trump\u2019s voter base is composed of KKK, white nationalists, and \u201calt-right\u201d figures.\u201d Herr Fuerher Trump is a punk. The article \u201cTrump isn\u2019t delivering his own DACA policy because he\u2019s cowardly and weak--An evasion of responsibility.\u201d states \u201cLong before he was a politician, Donald Trump was a showman. So it\u2019s telling that on the biggest political story of the week, the great impresario of nativist backlash politics has decided to make himself scarce. Instead of announcing his plan to kill the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program with a six-month delay personally, Trump is letting Jeff Sessions act as the star of the DACA episode of the Trump Show.\u201d Herr Fuerher Trump flip-flopping regarding DACA. The article \u201cDonald Trump Takes Back DACA Kill? Tweets Plan To \u201cRevisit\u201d If Congress Does Not \u201cLegalize\u201d In 6 Months\u201d states \u201cPresident Donald Trump appears to have been visited by the Ghosts of Dreamers Past and Future, because he\u2019s just tweeted \u201cNever mind\u201d \u2013 or words to that effect \u2013 on today\u2019s carefully orchestrated base-baiting announcement that DACA is D-E-A-D. The New York Times had reported White House insiders were worried Trump did not fully grasp the impact of what it was Attorney General Jeff Sessions had announced this morning \u2013 and which former President Barack Obama denounced in a Facebook post a few hours later. The sources said they feared Trump might capitulate if the blowback was bad.\u201d Herr Fuerher Trump doesn\u2019t even have 25% support from those who aren\u2019t in the alt-right. Herr Fuerher Trump is irrelevant. The Russians could have stolen the election for any GOP operative. The article \u201cRussian Election Hacking Efforts, Wider Than Previously Known, Draw Little Scrutiny\u201d states \u201cThe calls started flooding in from hundreds of irate North Carolina voters just after 7 a.m. on Election Day last November. Dozens were told they were ineligible to vote and were turned away at the polls, even when they displayed current registration cards. Others were sent from one polling place to another, only to be rejected. Scores of voters were incorrectly told they had cast ballots days earlier. In one precinct, voting halted for two hours. Susan Greenhalgh, a troubleshooter at a nonpartisan election monitoring group, was alarmed. Most of the complaints came from Durham, a blue-leaning county in a swing state. The problems involved electronic poll books \u2014 tablets and laptops, loaded with check-in software, that have increasingly replaced the thick binders of paper used to verify voters\u2019 identities and registration status. She knew that the company that provided Durham\u2019s software, VR Systems, had been penetrated by Russian hackers months before. \u201cIt felt like tampering, or some kind of cyberattack,\u201d Ms. Greenhalgh said about the voting troubles in Durham\u2026. But months later, for Ms. Greenhalgh, other election security experts and some state officials, questions still linger about what happened that day in Durham as well as other counties in North Carolina, Virginia, Georgia and Arizona. After a presidential campaign scarred by Russian meddling, local, state and federal agencies have conducted little of the type of digital forensic investigation required to assess the impact, if any, on voting in at least 21 states whose election systems were targeted by Russian hackers, according to interviews with nearly two dozen national security and state officials and election technology specialists.\u201d Irrational Herr Fuerher Trump. The August 23rd 2017 article \u201cPresident Trump is deteriorating before our very eyes\u201d states \u201cWere you deeply alarmed by President Trump\u2019s performance in Arizona on Tuesday night? If so, that is understandable. Trump is getting worse. He rambled and ranted with abandon. He hinted that he will pardon Joe Arpaio. He escalated his attacks on the media, accusing them of misrepresenting his response to the violence in Charlottesville. Yet he also doubled down on his defense of Confederate monuments, claiming that \u201cthey\u201d are trying to \u201ctake away our heritage and our history.\u201d (Emphasis added.) All of this appeared to signal a growing contempt for the rule of law and an increasing indifference to the health of our democracy and institutions, and to his own responsibilities and duty to the public to try to calm the antagonisms unleashed in Charlottesville\u2019s aftermath. If anything, at this difficult moment of national introspection, Trump conspicuously sought to further inflame those antagonisms. Some reacted with deep panic: Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper labeled the speech \u201cdownright scary and disturbing,\u201d adding: \u201cI really question his ability to be \u2014 his fitness to be \u2014 in this office.\u201d\u201d Herr Fuerher Trump attacks the media because he is afraid! The August 31st 2017 article \u201cMost Voters Think Trump Dislikes The Media More Than White Supremacists, Poll Finds --A majority believe the president is \u201ctearing the country apart.\u201d\u201d states \u201cVoters were asked an unusual question in a Fox News poll released Wednesday: Who does President Donald Trump dislike more \u2014 white supremacists or the news media? Trump has frequently lambasted the press as \u201cfake news\u201d and dismissed journalists as \u201c truly bad people\u201d after being criticized for failing to condemn white supremacists at the violent rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, this month. Voters, it seems, have taken note of his disdain for the press. The poll results show 70 percent of voters (and the majority of both Democrats and Republicans) believe the president dislikes the media more than white supremacists. Another 12 percent of respondents said he \u201cdislikes both.\u201d\u201d The August 23rd 2017 article \u201cTrump\u2019s vicious attack on the media shows one thing clearly: He\u2019s running scared\u201d states \u201cAs with so much about President Trump, his Phoenix rally on Tuesday night was two contradictory things: both shocking and completely predictable. Shocking because it was the most sustained attack any president has made on the news media. (\u201cIt\u2019s time to expose the crooked-media deceptions and challenge the media for their role in fomenting divisions,\u201d Trump ranted, as he charged that reporters invent sources and make up stories. \u201cThey are trying to take away our history and our heritage.\u201d) And predictable because this is exactly what Trump does when he\u2019s in trouble. He finds an enemy and punches as hard as he can.\u201d Herr Fuerher Trump knows the Russian investigation is circling him. The September 1 2017 article \u201cMueller examining Trump\u2019s draft letter firing FBI Director Comey\u201d states \u201cOn the day before President Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey, he summoned his vice president, chief of staff, top lawyer and other senior advisers to the Oval Office\u2026. The multi-page letter blasted Comey over his investigation of Trump\u2019s Democratic presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton. And, according to a person with direct knowledge of the contents of the letter, it conveyed Trump\u2019s displeasure that Comey would not say publicly what he had told the president three times privately: that the FBI\u2019s probe into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election was not focused on him\u2026 Mueller is likely to look into whether Trump, in consulting the Justice Department\u2019s top two officials, was seeking a pretense to fire his FBI director or, as some White House advisers said Friday, whether he was simply persuaded to consider their opinions before acting.\u201d The August 31st 2017 article \u201cManafort's notes from the Trump Tower Russia meeting reportedly mention political contributions and the RNC\u201d states \u201cCongressional investigators examining Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election are now focusing on whether the Trump campaign or the Republican National Committee received donations from Russian sources after a meeting involving two Russian lobbyists in Trump Tower last year, according to a Thursday NBC report.\u201d The August 28 2017 article \u201cTrump Associate Boasted That Moscow Business Deal \u2018Will Get Donald Elected\u2019\u201d states \u201cA business associate of President Trump promised in 2015 to engineer a real estate deal with the aid of the president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, that he said would help Mr. Trump win the presidency. The associate, Felix Sater, wrote a series of emails to Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Michael Cohen, in which he boasted about his ties to Mr. Putin. He predicted that building a Trump Tower in Moscow would highlight Mr. Trump\u2019s savvy negotiating skills and be a political boon to his candidacy. \u201cOur boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it,\u201d Mr. Sater wrote in an email. \u201cI will get all of Putins team to buy in on this, I will manage this process.\u201d\u201d The August 30 2017 article \u201cMueller teams up with New York attorney general in Manafort probe.\u201d states \u201cSpecial counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team is working with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on its investigation into Paul Manafort and his financial transactions, according to several people familiar with the matter. The cooperation is the latest indication that the federal probe into President Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman is intensifying. It also could potentially provide Mueller with additional leverage to get Manafort to cooperate in the larger investigation into Trump\u2019s campaign, as Trump does not have pardon power over state crimes.\u201d The article \u201cRussia probes kick into high gear\u201dstates \u201cThe congressional Russia investigations are entering a new and more serious phase as lawmakers return from the August recess amid fresh revelations about contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. In the coming weeks, both intelligence committees are expected to conduct closed-door interviews with high-ranking members of the Trump campaign, and potential witnesses could include Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort and Donald Trump Jr. The two panels are also looking at possibly holding public hearings this fall. In addition, Trump Jr. is set to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is conducting its own parallel investigation into President Donald Trump and his associates\u2019 alleged ties to Moscow. The return of the congressional Russia probes also means the return of a phenomenon that has reportedly enraged Trump and caused him to lash out at GOP leaders: constant headlines about the latest incremental developments in these sprawling and unwieldy investigations.\u201d The article \u201cMueller gives White House names of 6 aides he expects to question in Russia probe\u201d states\u201d Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III has alerted the White House that his team will probably seek to interview six top current and former advisers to President Trump who were witnesses to several episodes relevant to the investigation of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election, according to people familiar with the request. Mueller\u2019s interest in the aides, including trusted adviser Hope Hicks, former press secretary Sean Spicer and former chief of staff Reince Priebus, reflects how the probe that has dogged Trump\u2019s presidency is starting to penetrate a closer circle of aides around the president. Each of the six advisers was privy to important internal discussions that have drawn the interest of Mueller\u2019s investigators, including his decision in May to fire FBI Director James B. Comey and the White House\u2019s initial inaction following warnings that then-national security adviser Michael Flynn had withheld information from the public about his private discussions in December with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, according to people familiar with the probe.\u201d Neo-Nazis don\u2019t like dissent and that is why Herr Fuerher Trump is clamping down on free speech in the USA. The article \u201cReport: 'Anti-protester' bills gain traction in state legislatures\u201d states \u201cRepublican legislators in 20 U.S. statehouses have proposed \u2014 and six legislatures approved \u2014 new restrictions on the right to assemble and protest so far this year, according to a new reportby the Democrat-aligned State Innovation Exchange. \u201cThese bills would create a new set of crimes, significantly harsher penalties, and costly fines that could apply broadly to anyone \u2014 whether they are supporters of the president, members of the Tea Party, or just concerned parents speaking out at a school board meeting,\u201d according to an advance copy of the report. SiX works to advance progressive policies at the state level and calls the wave of bills a \u201cnew and disturbing trend.\u201d\u201d The irrational and irrelevant Herr Fuerher Trump is a punk who terrorizes for political power. Herr Fuerher Trump\u2019s decision to end the deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA) policy effectively disrupts the futures of the nearly 800,000 young people who have known no home other than the United States. home since childhood Herr Fuerher Trump knows this is a an incredible loss for America and knows this undermines the very foundation on which this country of immigrants was built, but he wants to appeal to his vile base. He is willing to suppress free speech because he realizes that there are more intelligent citizens who will protest against him than his vile alt-right supporters. The Russian investigation is getting closer to Trump. He is scared and he know he has to keep his base satisfied, to reduce the odds that he gets impeached.","label":1}

{"text":"After urging guns in schools, Trump OK with gun ban at NRA speech: President Donald Trump hosts Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari at the White House - DC NRA 5-1-18 Trump is fine with forcing people to lay down their guns when it's about his safety. For people who insists guns make everyone safer, Trump and the NRA don\u2019t seem to have any problem that firearms are banned when Trump speaks at the radical gun group\u2019s annual convention on Friday. The hypocrisy comes after Trump teamed up with the NRA in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, gun massacre, and announced that flooding American schools with armed teachers is the best way to keep students safe. The doomed policy plays off the NRA myth that we\u2019re all safer the more people are armed in America. But for some reason that\u2019s not put into practice at the NRA convention when Trump\u2019s in town. NRA members who want to attend Trump\u2019s speech, or Mike Pence\u2019s NRA speech this week, will be forced to leave their guns outside of Houston\u2019s Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center. That\u2019s because the Secret Service will be in charge of the protection, and the Secret Service, obviously, doesn\u2019t allow armed individuals to be around the president or other people it\u2019s charged with protecting. The Secret Service, in effect, categorically rejects the NRA rhetoric that more guns equals more safety. The hypocrisy here is rather stunning \u2014 America needs to fill its schools with guns in order to protect students, but it makes total sense nobody with a gun is allowed to be in same room as President of the United States. The NRA this week tries to hide behind the Secret Service in order to escape claims of duplicity. But if the NRA were true to its values, wouldn\u2019t it be demanding that guns be allowed into Trump and Pence speeches? And if not, why doesn\u2019t the group withdraw its invitation? Why is okay for the President of the United States to expect the safety of a gun-free environment when the NRA remains thoroughly committed to making sure Americans are confronted with gun-carrying citizens at grocery stores, gas stations, churches, and schools across the country? NRA loud mouths like Dana Loesch preach to their choir that\u2019s there\u2019s a culture war on guns and the government is trying to strip them of their rights. Yet the NRA\u2019s okay with members being forced to lay down their firearms for Pence and Trump speeches. So much for good guys with guns. (And Trump still won\u2019t honor James Shaw Jr., a good guy from a recent mass shooting.) Trump\u2019s hypocrisy is blatant too. Why doesn\u2019t he use his Twitter platform to publicly rail against protocols that ban guns at his events? Why doesn\u2019t he categorically insists that when he address a crowd that it must be fill with firearms? After all, if schools would allegedly be safer with lots of educators walking around with guns, that same logic should hold true for Trump events. Also, remember that Trump has publicly bragged that if faced with a shooting, he\u2019d be the first one to spring into action and run towards the gun fire. But forget all that because Trump\u2019s cool with guns being banned at his NRA speech.","label":1}

That doesn\u2019t mean police can\u2019t and don\u2019t arrest individuals for their involvement in Bitcoin, though. In Nepal, at least seven people were arrested for being involved in cryptocurrency trading operations. It seems these trades were executed \u201cwithout authorization\u201d. That\u2019s a strange explanation, considering Nepal doesn\u2019t have any active cryptocurrency regulation whatsoever.

However, local law enforcement certainly feels otherwise, as they arrested seven individuals for their cryptocurrency trading activities this week. This certainly begs the question as to why these people were arrested in the first place. According to a local source which contacted us by email, the arrests were made due to trading bitcoins \u201cwithout authorization\u201d. That is a rather interesting point of view put forth by the Central Investigation Bureau, as consumers in Nepal can\u2019t ask anyone for permission when it comes to dealing with cryptocurrencies whatsoever. Nor should anyone need to do so in the first place. While it is true a communist government won\u2019t take kindly toward cryptocurrencies, arresting people without a valid reason won\u2019t go over too well either. Regulatory guidelines are currently being worked out by the Nepalese government, but until those are in place, people are still free to do as they like. Or that is how it should be, at least, even though a communist government may have a very different opinion on these matters. Local press reports indicate that the suspects were arrested in Kathmandu and Chitwan. They are all still in police custody as we speak, but no further information has been revealed as of yet. All of this raises even more questions as to why these people were arrested in the first place. No currency amounts have been specified either, which only adds more fuel to this mystery investigation. It is evident that all suspects face jail time, although the grounds on which such a verdict would be determined remain unclear. More broadly, it seems things are going from bad to worse in Nepal for Bitcoin users and companies as we speak. The impending regulation will assuredly introduce some changes over the next few months. It is certainly possible the government will crack down on cryptocurrencies as a whole and prohibit this new form of money from being traded altogether. Bitsewa, one of the few exchanges based in the country, has already shut down this week. The Nepalese version of LocalBitcoins isn\u2019t all that popular either, which is somewhat surprising. It will be interesting to see how the cryptocurrency sector develops in Nepal. Although this is not a major cryptocurrency hub by any stretch of the imagination, any form of regulation could set a dangerous precedent and stifle innovation. Whether or not Bitcoin will be banned altogether remains anybody\u2019s guess for the time being. There are a lot of questions and very few answers right now; that much is certain.","label":0}
{"text":"India's Darul Uloom Deoband bans women from plucking their eyebrows: Maulana L. Sadiq Qasmi of Darul Uloom Deoband in India. PHOTO COURTESY: DNA The Darul Uloom Deoband in India issued a fatwa on Saturday banning women from plucking, trimming and shaping their eyebrows and also cutting their hair. Darul Iftaa, which issues the Darul Uloom Deoband\u2019s edicts, termed the act as \u201cun-Islamic\u201d. A Muslim man from Saharanpur had asked Daul Iftaa on Islamic laws about eyebrow trimming and hair-cutting. \u201cDo Islamic laws allow my wife to go for eyebrow plucking and hair-cutting?\u201d the man asked Darul Iftaa. In response to his query, the Darul Iftaa issued a fatwa saying that both the acts were \u2018un-Islamic\u2019 and banned under Islamic laws. \u201cIf a Muslim woman is involved in such acts then she is violating Islamic laws,\u201d read the fatwa in Urdu. Saudi cleric claims Earth is stationary, does not revolve around Sun Darul Iftaa clarified that there are 10 acts, including eyebrow plucking and hair-cutting which were banned for Muslim women under Islam. \u201cHair adds to the beauty of Muslim women and they should never get them cut, pointed the fatwa. Issuing the fatwa, Darul Iftaa head Maulana L. Sadiq Qasmi said, \u201cMuslim women should stay away from beauty parlours as Islam does not permit them to have make-up that attracts other male members.\u201d He added that Muslim men too were not allowed to shave under Islam, trim eyebrows, wear make-up etc is. \u201cThe trend of Muslim women going to beauty parlours has increased in the country. It is not a good sign and it should be stopped immediately. We should have issued a fatwa in this regard long ago,\u201d he maintained. Three years ago, the Darul Iftaa in London had conducted a detailed study on the contentious issue taking into account all schools of Islamic thought including Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi and Hanbali. It also imposed a similar ban with an exception that Muslim women \u2013 married or unmarried \u2013 were allowed to remove facial hair if they develop moustache, beard or unwanted hair with permission from the husband or other male members. Saudi cleric condemns snowmen as anti-Islamic \u201cIf there is no such defect then it is not permitted for a Muslim girl or woman to expose her eyebrows in front of non-Muslim men\u201d the study concluded. But most Muslim women have refused to follow the new fatwa. \u201cThey have no right to curtail our freedom. The world is changing. Muslim women are now allowed to drive in Gulf countries and they are issuing fatwas on eyebrow plucking. It is a shame on our Maulanas and scholars,\u2019 said Sophia Ahmed. Another woman, Safia Begum, said, \u201cThe fatwa also applies on Muslim men not to shave. Show me how many Muslim men in India are keeping a beard these days, except for these fake Maulanas. They should better watch \u2018Lipstick under my burqa\u2019 before issuing such ridiculous fatwas. Like me, the majority of the Muslim women in India will defy the ban.\u201d This article was originally published in DNA.","label":0}

{"text":"Trump says Comey knew he was going to exonerate Clinton: US politician Hillary Rodham Clinton delivers a speech during a ceremony where she received a Honorary Doctorate at Swansea University, in recognition of her commitment to promoting the rights of families and children around the world... WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to revive his long-standing complaint about the FBI\u2019s handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation, alleging that then-Director James Comey had protected the Democratic presidential nominee by prematurely \u201cexonerating\u201d her before the 2016 election. \u201cComey stated under oath that he didn\u2019t do this \u2014 obviously a fix?\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWhere is Justice Dept?\u201d Trump\u2019s latest online burst came in response to the FBI\u2019s release of heavily blacked out draft statements from May 2016 by Comey in preparation for closing the Clinton investigation without criminal charges. Trump tweeted that the draft statements, whose existence was previously known, show the FBI had exonerated \u201cCrooked Hillary Clinton\u201d long before the investigation was complete. He tweeted: \u201cJames Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!\u201d In interview excerpts released in August by the Senate Judiciary Committee, FBI officials said Comey and investigators had determined by the spring of 2016 that charges weren\u2019t warranted, and had begun thinking of how the public should be informed of that decision. Clinton was interviewed by the FBI in early July, just days before Comey announced the investigation\u2019s conclusion. That timing has prompted criticism that FBI leadership had prejudged the conclusion before completing the investigation. When Comey announced the end of the case last year, he said the FBI had found no evidence that anyone intended to violate laws governing classified materials, which it considered a prerequisite for bringing a case. He said the FBI had thoroughly investigated the case for a year before deciding to conclude it. \u201cWe went at this very hard to see if we could make a case,\u201d Comey told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee days after announcing his recommendation that Clinton not face charges. Trump, as both a candidate and now president, has long complained about the FBI\u2019s handling of the email case, though his criticism has varied. He initially cited Comey\u2019s actions in the investigation as a basis for Comey\u2019s firing in May, though Trumo later acknowledged that he was determined to replace the FBI director even without the recommendation of the Justice Department. The president complained again after Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released excerpts of interviews with FBI officials close to Comey. Those interviews showed that draft statements to close out the Clinton investigation had begun circulating among a tight circle of FBI officials in the spring of 2016. The interviews were conducted by officials from the Office of Special Counsel who were trying to determine if Comey\u2019s actions had violated a federal law that bars government officials from using their positions to influence an election. That investigation was closed following Comey\u2019s firing by Trump in May. ___ Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/etuckerAP Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Associated Press.

{"text":"The GOP Tax-Pocalypse: Trump Shows GOP That the Truth is Now Irrelevant to the Republican Base: Republican senators know this tax bill will be disastrous. But they all are falling in line. Photo Credit: Flickr Creative Commons \/ DonkeyHotey When Barack Obama became president in 2009, he called together all the opinion leaders in Washington and announced that he was planning to propose a Grand Bargain that would include a cut in \"entitlement\" spending in exchange for the Republicans agreeing to allow the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans to expire. It had progressive Democrats in a state of agitation, feeling that the president was selling out the signature achievement of the New Deal for a temporary tax hike. The Tea Party right refused to take yes for an answer. The Democrats were offering to take the heat and cut those hated \"entitlements,\" yet the far right couldn't bear raising taxes on rich people. Silly Tea Partyers, didn't they realize that they were walking away from a great deal? It turns out they were biding their time until they held all the levers of power again so they could slash taxes for the wealthy, raise taxes on everyone else and institute \"triggers\" to cut vital programs as soon as their deep cuts start to raise the deficit, as they inevitably will. Why take half a loaf when you can hold out and get the whole bakery? They even did a trial run in one of the \"laboratories of democracy\" to prove to everyone how slashing taxes on the wealthy and cutting all those \"entitlements\" that encourage dependency will boost growth dramatically and make everybody richer, happier and more successful. This was what we might call Sam Brownback's \"Make Kansas Great Again\" plan, which he literally sold to his constituents by saying their state was going to be the \"Petri dish\" for all the supply-side economic lunacy the right has been trying to enact for decades. He did it, too. And it didn't work out very well. As one Kansas Republican lawmaker told the Atlantic:  \u201cIt was supposed to increase the GDP, and it didn\u2019t. The feds will have that same problem,\u201d said state Senator Jim Denning, a conservative who originally supported the tax cuts. In a phone interview, Denning told me he had done his own economic modeling in 2012 and \u201cproved to myself that the tax cut would work.\u201d But the new policy did not prevent a rural recession in Kansas or a dip in its oil-and-gas business. \u201cIt generated hardly any measurable economic activity,\u201d Denning said. By the beginning of this year, he had changed course and voted along with Democrats and a coalition of Republicans to reverse most of the cuts, erasing Brownback\u2019s economic legacy.  Donald Trump generously relieved Kansans of Brownback himself, by nominating him to be the ambassador-at-large for \"international religious freedom.\" He has not yet been confirmed. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, has been getting an earful from his constituents who are gobsmacked that he is planning to vote to do to the whole country what they did to their state. The Kansas City Star editorial board recounted a conversation the senator had with one of his voters who asked him: \u201cWhy would you take this failed experiment nationwide? Our members of Congress should be the ones leading the way for tax reform that actually affects normal people, not just millionaires and billionaires.\u201d Report Advertisement Sadly, that's unlikely. Certainly Sam Brownback won't be issuing the warning. He's in Washington this week trying to push through his confirmation -- and telling outrageous lies, as Salon's Sophia Tesfaye wrote earlier. Apparently, Donald Trump shared with Brownback some of that strange brew that makes people believe that up is down and black is white:  Yes, guys. I'm aware of what happened in Kansas. Here's our story from last year: https:\/\/t.co\/BeRqwbN23B\u2014 Richard Rubin (@RichardRubinDC) November 29, 2017  Surely the Republicans all know this. Moran even admitted that Kansas is \"discussed\" in Washington, one assumes as a cautionary tale. And yes, the federal government is not like a state for a hundred different reasons, which makes it unlikely that the consequences would be exactly the same. Nonetheless, it's patently obvious that this tax plan will be a disaster on a national scale, probably resulting in some kind of crisis these same Republicans will then insist requires deep austerity measures to fix. That's the game as it's been played for 30 years, and it's always worked out fine for them. They cut taxes on the rich and the economy eventually goes to hell, at which point Democrats are voted in to clean up the mess, and the GOP insists on spending cuts to vital programs to pay off the debt they incurred with their tax-cutting spree. Report Advertisement Unlike in the past, these tax cuts are extremely unpopular. According to FiveThirtyEight's Harry Enten, this bill is more unpopular than most tax hike bills are. Why? Because everyone knows it's a giveaway to the rich at the expense of the middle class. The GOP Congress could take its time and fashion a bill where the numbers add up. That could at least pass muster with most Republican voters. So why are they in such a frenzy to pass this monstrosity? It's hard to know. It's almost as if congressional Republicans are on autopilot, unable to exercise free will. Many of them, like Moran of Kansas, know very well that this plan is an utter disaster that will result in higher taxes for everyone but the top 1 percent, along with the degradation of important programs like Medicare, all of which will be used against them in upcoming elections. If I had to guess, I'd say they are simply mesmerized by what Trump has been able to do. All week long we've been reading stories about how he is creating his own reality, unmoored from facts and truth. People are whispering about the 25th Amendment and wondering if the president of the United States might actually have a breakdown. But these GOP officials watched Trump give a speech in Missouri on Wednesday, where the crowd cheered wildly while he claimed that his plan has wealthy people like himself complaining about having their taxes increased so ordinary people can have a big tax cut. Republican senators all know that's a brazen lie. It is literally the opposite of the truth. But they see those Trump voters believing every word he says, and they understand that the truth is now irrelevant to the Republican base. All Trump's supporters want is to see their hero win. If he loses yet again because the Republican Congress fails to deliver a bill for him to sign, members of that Congress know there will be hell to pay. Republicans are happy to pass a tax cut, of course. It's what they live for. But this is a Kansas-level economic debacle in the making, and they are not stupid enough not to understand that. They're betting that their seats are safer if they go along with Trump's magical thinking than if they stay in the real world. After all, the Republicans have been lying almost as much as Trump -- about almost as many things -- for a long time. This time they've decided to hold their collective breath and dive down the rabbit hole with him. Maybe some of that Trump Teflon will rub off on them.

{"text":"Mueller Investigators Looking at Ivanka Trump Contacts with Russians at Trump Tower Meeting: Photo Credit: lev radin \/ Shutterstock.com Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigators are exploring Ivanka Trump\u2019s potential contacts with Russians attending a key June 9, 2016 meeting in Trump Tower. The Los Angeles Times reports that Ivanka Trump, who did not attend the meeting, spoke at the elevator with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin. Mueller has recalled at least one of the meeting\u2019s participants for further questioning. \u201cEven if you thought that this [meeting] was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad \u2026, and I happen to think it\u2019s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately,\u201d Steve Bannon said in the new Michael Wolff book, Fire and Fury. \u201cThe chance that Don Jr. did not walk these jumos up to his father\u2019s office on the twenty-sixth floor is zero,\u201d Bannon concluded. Veselnitskaya, Akhmetshin, translator Anatoli Samochornov and Ike Kaveladze attended the meeting with Paul Manafort, Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner. \u201cSome defense lawyers involved in the case view Mueller\u2019s latest push as a sign that investigators are focusing on possible obstruction of justice by Trump and several of his closest advisors for their statements about the politically sensitive meeting, rather than for collusion with the Russians,\u201d the LA Times explained.

{"text":"Does Malia Obama have Secret Service protection at Harvard?: Unable to play video. HTML5 is not supported! There is speculation about whether or not 19-year-old Malia Obama has a Secret Service detail at Harvard University where she attends school. While at least one report from August said that the former president\u2019s eldest daughter will have a Secret Service detail, the move would be an exception to a bill former President Barack Obama himself signed into law more than four years ago. The legislation restored lifetime Secret Service protection for former presidents, first ladies, and \"children of former presidents until they become 16 years of age.\" See Gallery Previously, departing U.S. presidents were only followed by agents for 10 years in order to save on costs, notes Politico. However, even before the change was made, exceptions were possible. Until 2009, both George W. Bush and Bill Clinton had authorized extended protection for their respective daughters even though they were legal adults and lost their federal coverage. But Jenna and Barbara Bush and Chelsea Clinton were in a slightly different situation than Malia Obama because they had become college students while their fathers were still in office. It is unknown if Mr. Obama followed his predecessors\u2019 lead in requesting extra coverage for his eldest child, but, the Washington Post wrote last year that \"for Malia, the decision to delay school one year may mean she will not have to be accompanied by the Secret Service contingent that would be required if she [had begun] college [immediately].\" As for the current administration, President Trump has attracted criticism for straining the Secret Service\u2019s budget due to his family\u2019s extensive travel.

{"text":"Facebook bans rapper Lil B for &quot;hate speech&quot;: According to a report from Vice\u2019s Motherboard, rapper Lil B\u2014a.k.a. TheBasedGod\u2014has been temporarily banned from Facebook for violating the site\u2019s policies on hate speech, with the offending posts quickly being removed by Facebook. On Twitter, Lil B explained that he was for \u201ctalking about white people,\u201d and the Motherboard post notes that a number of black activists have also recently been banned for making statements about white people on Facebook. Now, after some predictable backlash to the ban, Lil B has shared the posts in question: Facebook is also commenting on the ban now, explaining that it will last for 30 days and that it comes from \u201cat least five violations\u201d of the site\u2019s policies (though Lil B says he was only notified of two). As for why this violated the policies in the first place, a Facebook spokesperson defends the decision by suggesting it would be clearer \u201cif you were to change \u2018white\u2019 to something else, like \u2018black people are the problem, they\u2019re so violent.\u2019\u201d The spokesperson also adds that the site\u2019s hate speech policies \u201capply equally to all races\u201d and are \u201crace-neutral.\u201d Of course, anyone who has ever been on Facebook can tell you that it doesn\u2019t really work like that, and Motherboard presented Facebook with a number of posts that would seem to violate the policy but somehow don\u2019t.

{"text":"15 History Books You Didn't Get Assigned In School But Definitely Need To Read: Right now all around the country, Confederate statues are being taken down, and the issue has the nation divided. On one side, Americans are ready to let go of memorials that glorify the leaders who fought to preserve slavery and promote racial discrimination, and on the other, people are claiming the removal of these monuments is an erasure of history. For those people who are worried that this country's narrative won't survive taking down these painful reminders of hatred, racism, and bigotry, these essential history books you didn't read in school will fill in all those gaps and more. They say that history is written by the victors, but what happens when those victors decide to leave the important details out? All too often, history texts and academic courses leave out the narratives of indigenous Americans, immigrants, forced and otherwise, black Americans, including slaves, the LGBTQ community, and the other marginalized groups that are a crucial part of U.S. history, but who are left our of every text book. To be able to fully grasp the present political, cultural, and historical moment, it's important to understand the past, and that including the dark and painful parts, the uncomfortable moments, the untold stories of every kind of American. That's why you need to read these essential history books that your history teacher never assigned you. 'A People's History of the United States' by Howard Zinn A classic among progressive history texts, Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States tells America's story from the perspective of the people who are often left out of textbooks: Native Americans, African Americans, immigrant laborers, women, and others. Covering the country's long and complicated history, from Christopher Columbus to President Bill Clinton, this American Book Award-winner doesn't shy away from the most controversial topics, including slavery, genocide, child labor, women's oppression, and so much more. An eye-opening text that sheds light on some of America's darkest moments, A People's History of the United States is an engaging book that will change the way you think of our country's past. 'Columbus and Other Cannibals' by Jack D. Forbes A history book told from the perspective of Native Americans, Columbus and Other Cannibals exposes one of our country's most celebrated heroes for what he really was: a thief, a liar, a murderer, and a destroyer. In his seminal text, historian Jack D. Forbes describes how Columbus and the other \"civilized\" Westerners have spent centuries committing genocide, acts of terrorism, and environmental destruction. A hard-hitting look at the ways in which exploitation and imperialism have been slowly killing the planet, this anti-civilization manifesto will reshape your beliefs of America's past, present, and future. 'The Making of Asian America: A History' by Erika Lee Since the mid-20th century, Asian Americans have played a crucial role in the development of the nation, but their narrative is often left out of the history books. Celebrated scholar and expert Erika Lee seeks to correct that in The Making of Asian America, a history book of Asian Americans that spans centuries and the globe. An engaging text about Asian Americans' past \u2014 as slaves in the Caribbean, as railroad laborers in the Pacific Northwest, as prisoners in internment camps during WWII \u2014 as well as their present, racially charged status as America's \"model minorities,\" this book offers a new way of looking at race, immigration, and identity in the United States. 'An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States' by Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz Another much-needed history lesson about the United States as told from the perspective of the people who were here first, this eye-opening text explores the more than four centuries of oppression, colonialism, genocide, and resistance that is all too often left out of traditional history books. In An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States, activist and celebrated historian Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz re-frames America's founding story and subsequent history to include the policies and practices of American settlers, colonists, and later citizens that not only drove indigenous people from their land, but attempted to wipe them from the map (and the history books) forever. A remarkable work that shatters the heroic myths of Christopher Columbus and provides new context for understanding the struggles of modern day indigenous peoples, this history book will make you think twice before celebrating Columbus Day. 'When Affirmative Action Was White: An Untold History of Racial Inequality in Twentieth-Century America' by Ira Katznelson In this groundbreaking history book, Ira Katznelson reveals how the discriminatory roots behind some of America's key programs of the 1930s and 1940s has lead to the inequality between white Americans and people of color today. When Affirmative Action Was White uses historical examples from the New Deal and Fair Deal era to explain the ways politicians, specifically Southern Democrats, forced the gap between black and white Americans to widen, and how that divide still exists in the modern day United States. A fascinating look at the ways the American government has worked to prop white people up and keep black people down, this book will change the way you see affirmative action. '1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus' by Charles C. Mann Despite the fact that most American history books start with Christopher Columbus's \"discovery\" of America, the country's rich history starts long before the Europeans stepped foot on its shore. In 1491, award-winning author Charles C. Mann draws from historical, archaeological, anthropological, scientific, and literary evidence to shine a light on what pre-Columbian America was really like: a large populated nation of thriving Americans actively shaping the world around them. Engaging and thought-provoking, Mann's account of Native American history will transform your ideas of indigenous life in North America. 'Transgender History: The Roots of Today's Revolution' by Susan Stryker (Nov. 7) Even in the most inclusive texts about civil rights, transgender stories are all too often left out. Susan Stryker seeks to correct those omissions in her Transgender History, a book dedicated to the history of the American transgender community that spans the mid-twentieth century to present day. Including chapters on everything from transsexual and transvestite communities to the identity politics of modern-day America and featuring sidebars with important quotes, facts, and biographies, this pioneering text should be in every library and school in the country. 'The Slave Ship: A Human History' by Marcus Rediker Dark, disturbing, and historically accurate, The Slave Ship recounts the deeply human true story of the evil institution that shaped British and American history for centuries. Historian and scholar Marcus Rediker uses archival information, journal entries, court records, and first-person accounts to recreate the experience of imprisoned slaves on what the author calls \"floating dungeons.\" Powerful and heartbreaking, this is a crucial text about an all-too-often skimmed-over piece of American (and British) history. 'The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism' by Edward E. Baptist In most American history books, slavery is painted as a dark and distant chapter in the country's otherwise glowing history. But in Edward E. Baptist's revolutionary text, the award-winning author describes slavery's full-blown legacy as the foundation on which the country's capitalist economy was built on. A comprehensive and extensive history that re-frames the modernization of the United States, The Half Has Never Been Told is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the troubling but undeniable connection between slavery and American prosperity. 'Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers: A History of Lesbian Life in Twentieth-Century America' by Lillian Faderman Fascinating as it is informative, Lillian Faderman's carefully researched text explores the history of lesbian life in the United States in the twentieth-century. Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers draws from intimate journals, news articles, literature, medical records, pop culture, and more to trace the evolution of lesbianism across different ages, races, and classes. A unique historical account that never quite makes it into text books, this scholarly account breaks down stereotypes and corrects misconceptions about lesbian love, sexuality, and relationships. 'Coming to America: A History of Immigration and Ethnicity in American Life' by Roger Daniels Updated to include a new history of immigration in the context of the modern globalized world, Roger Daniels's seminal Coming to America traces the history of immigration in the United States. Starting with the colonial settlers, this informative text includes chapters on a wide variety of groups who came to this country, including those forced to come here as a result of the African and pan-Caribbean slave trade. Revealing and engaging, this is one of the most authoritative text of immigration to the United States. 'Life Upon These Shores: Looking at African American History, 1513-2008' by Henry Louis Gates Jr. From the arrival of the first conquistadors in 1513 to the election of Barack Obama in 2008, Henry Louis Gates, Jr.'s formative text traces the history of African Americans in stark detail and deep insight. A book filled with important and often ignored stories, Life Upon These Shores explores the many different experiences of black Americans, including slavery, the Civil War, the Great Migration, Civil Rights, and beyond. This image-heavy volume, which includes ancient maps, primary documents, photographs, artwork, posters and more, truly illustrates African American history. 'A Queer History of the United States' by Michael Bronski Contrary to popular belief, queerness has always been apart of American history. Unfortunately, stories about it have been almost entirely left out of the books. In A Queer History of the United States scholar, activist, and award-winning author Michael Bronski draws from primary sources, literature and cultural histories to trace gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender history from pre-1492 to the present. Including not only notable figures and revolutionary movements, this radical text sheds a light on the disregarded aspects of American history and the important roles the LBGTQ community played in them. A truly illuminating read. 'The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration' by Isabel Wilkerson In this award-winning book, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Isabel Wilkerson recounts the untold history of the migration of six million black Americansfrom the South to the north and west over the course of over six decades in the twentieth century. The Warmth of Other Suns traces the exodus through the experience of three people: Ida Mae Gladney in 1937, George Starling in 1945, and Robert Foster in 1953. Gripping, enlightening, and richly detailed, this remarkable narrative should be apart of every American history course.","label":0}
{"text":"How To Call Your Representatives For Gun Control Reform, Because It's More Important Now Than It Ever Has Been: The tragic shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Sunday, Oct. 1 \u2014 the largest mass shooting in modern U.S. history \u2014 is another devastating result of America's lax gun laws. If you're feeling helpless, it's a good time to learn how to call your representative for gun control reform. As The Washington Post has reported, at least 50 people have been killed and more than 400 have been injured as a result of the attack carried out by a shooter staying at the nearby Mandalay Bay hotel. When a SWAT team descended on the shooter's room at the casino, they found him deceased from an alleged self-inflicted gunshot wound. Police also recovered more than 10 rifles that the shooter used to fire on concert-goers attending a country music festival on the Las Vegas strip; they have yet to determine a motive.  Our grief isn't enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again.  Among those calling for gun control reform is Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, who in a 2016 interview with the Las Vegas Sun said that there is no practical reason for anyone to possess high-capacity magazines.  \"I'm a very avid hunter, I was in the military myself, and there\u2019s no need to have a high-capacity magazine for any practical reason,\" Lombardo said during a recent interview with the Sun.   To the contrary, the dangers posed by such magazines are obvious. Lombardo says the time it takes for suspects to change magazines gives potential victims an opportunity to escape and law enforcement officials an opportunity to safely fire back. That being the case, the fewer times a shooter has to switch out magazines, the fewer the chances for people to get away and authorities to get a protected shot.  If you want to add your voice to the list of people asking for laws that make it harder to obtain assault rifles, here's how to call your representatives about gun control reform. How To Contact Your Reps About Gun Control Reform First, if you don't know who you senators and reps are, the group Everytown for Gun Safety makes is easy to find out. Just fill out the form, and they'll find your senator and rep for you so you can let them know how you feel about gun control reform.  [S]end an overwhelming message of opposition to Congress. Call your senators and tell them you OPPOSE concealed carry reciprocity.   When you reach a staff member or a voicemail box, please tell them the following things: 1. Tell them your name, and that you're a constituent. 2. Tell them to vote NO on Senate Bill 446, what they call \"concealed carry reciprocity\".  Let them know that you're not OK with the fact that those living in the U.S. are 25 times more likely to die as a result of gun violence than people living in other developed countries. You can also text your support by texting ACT to the number 64433. Another way to make your voice heard is to harness the power of social media and tweet at Congress to ask them to support gun control reform. The form from Everytown can set up the tweet for you, you just need to add your congressperson's Twitter handle. If there is any doubt that gun violence is a problem, consider these facts compiled by Vox: the U.S. has 4.4 percent of the world\u2019s population, but almost half of the civilian-owned guns around the world the U.S. has far more deaths from gun violence than any other developed nation in the world there have been more than 1,300 mass shootings since Sandy Hook on average, there is more than one mass shooting for each day in the U.S. states with more guns have more gun deaths, while states with tighter gun control laws have fewer gun-related deaths support for gun ownership has sharply increased since the early '90s It's time to let your Congress members know where you stand on gun control reform. To paraphrase the words of Clinton, we must put politics aside and unite to stop this from happening again. Because, it literally happens every single day.","label":1}

{"text":"1,000 leads later, authorities still stumped by Vegas gunman:  Flowers, candles and other items surround the famous Las Vegas sign at a makeshift memorial for victims of a mass shooting in Las Vegas, October 9, 2017. (AP\/John Locher) LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 More than a week after the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history investigators are stumped about the key question: What led a 64-year-old high-stakes gambler to kill 58 people and wound hundreds of others at a country music concert? It\u2019s an answer they may never find. The FBI and Las Vegas police have sorted through more than a thousand leads and examined Stephen Paddock\u2019s politics, finances, any possible terrorist radicalization and his social behavior. By Monday they had repeatedly searched his homes and interviewed his brother, girlfriend and others he\u2019s done business with. Free Sign Up But the typical investigative avenues that have helped uncover the motive in past shootings have yielded few clues about Paddock, a professional gambler who spent nearly every waking hour playing video poker at casinos. That closeted existence has covered the trail for investigators. \u201cThis individual purposely hid his actions leading up to this event and it is difficult for us to find the answers to those actions,\u201d Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said Monday, conceding he\u2019s frustrated. The FBI has brought in behavioral profilers as they continue questioning Paddock\u2019s live-in girlfriend, Marilou Danley, about his gun purchases and what she may have noticed about his behavior, Lombardo said.  Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo, left, with Aaron C. Rouse, special agent in charge for the FBI in Nevada, discusses the Route 91 Harvest festival mass shooting at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department headquarters in Las Vegas, October 9, 2017. (Erik Verduzco\/Las Vegas Review-Journal via AP) Paddock had stockpiled 23 guns, a dozen of them modified to fire continuously like an automatic weapon inside his 32nd-floor Mandalay Bay hotel room, where he busted out two windows before opening fire on the crowd. The sheriff changed the timeline of the shooting Monday, explaining that a security guard in the hotel\u2019s hallway responding to a report of an open door heard drilling from Paddock\u2019s room. Paddock, who had installed three cameras to monitor the approach to his suite, opened fire through the door, spraying 200 shots down the hall and wounding the guard, who alerted other security officials. A few minutes later, Paddock began the 10-minute attack on those on the ground. Previously the sheriff had said the guard\u2019s arrival in the hallway may have caused Paddock to stop firing. He said Monday he didn\u2019t know what prompted Paddock to end his deadly gunfire. The gunman had shot at aviation fuel tanks, stocked his car with explosives and had personal protection gear as part of an escape plan, authorities said Monday. Paddock\u2019s life has remained somewhat of a mystery and most people who have interacted with him said nothing really stood out about him. \u201cIt\u2019s his actual normalcy that makes him a fascinating study,\u201d said David Gomez, a former FBI profiler.  This undated photo provided by Eric Paddock on October 1, 2017, shows his brother, Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock. (Courtesy of Eric Paddock via AP) The small group people who knew Paddock well has said the one-time IRS agent and the son of a notorious bank robber did essentially nothing except gamble, sleep and travel between casinos. Investigators are sifting through every piece of Paddock\u2019s life from birth to death, Lombardo has said. \u201cEvery piece of information we get is one more piece of the puzzle,\u201d the sheriff said Monday. Experts say it is extremely unusual to have so few clues more than a week after a mass shooting. In past mass killings or terrorist attacks, killers left notes, social media postings and information on a computer, or even phoned police. In this case, there was no suicide note, no manifesto, no evidence the gunman was motivated by any ideology and Paddock has no clear presence on social media, police said. The FBI is working around-the-clock and a \u201ccomprehensive picture is being drawn as to the suspect\u2019s mental state,\u201d the sheriff said. Though at this point, they haven\u2019t found any one particular event in Paddock\u2019s life that triggered the shooting, he said. Clark County Coroner John Fudenberg said Monday an autopsy was done but could not discuss results of whether it yielded any clues to Paddocks actions. But even as investigators work to try to figure out what might\u2019ve led Paddock to commit the shooting, there may never be a clear answer. \u201cSometimes there isn\u2019t an understandable explanation for why someone commits a horrific crime,\u201d Gomez said. What has become very clear to investigators is that Paddock meticulously planned the attack. He requested an upper-floor room overlooking the country music festival and set up cameras inside and outside his room to watch for approaching officers.  Drapes billow out of broken windows at the Mandalay Bay resort and casino on the Las Vegas Strip, October 2, 2017(AP\/John Locher) After the shooting, police found a piece of paper on a nightstand in Paddock\u2019s hotel room that contained a series of numbers that helped him calculate a more precise aim, accounting for the trajectory of shots being fired from that height and the distance between his room and the concert, a federal official said. The official wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the details of the ongoing investigation publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. In not leaving behind an easily accessible manifesto, Paddock defied societal expectations that mass murderers will want their disturbed motives known to the world, said Clint Van Zandt, a former FBI profiler and hostage negotiator. \u201cThe reason you want to engage in an attack is you want to be promoting your extremist ideology \u2014 you want publicity,\u201d said Erroll Southers, director of homegrown violent extremism studies at the University of Southern California. \u201cYou want people to be afraid of what you believe and what you do.\u201d But although most killers may want to take credit for their act, Paddock might have reveled in the riddle he\u2019s presented for investigators, Van Zandt said. \u201cHe may even find some solace knowing that, \u2018I\u2019ve left so few footprints, they\u2019re going to have a helluva time figuring out who I am.\u2019 And that, in his challenged mind, might bring him a terrible level of satisfaction,\u201d he said. Despite the absence of easy answers, investigators may still be able to fill out a portrait of Paddock\u2019s mindset in the coming weeks, Van Zandt said. \u201cInstead of a eureka moment, I think what investigators are doing is they\u2019re putting an ounce of information at a time on the scale,\u201d he said.","label":0}
{"text":"How Trump Is Preparing for War: Donald Trump. (Evan Vucci \/ AP) What\u2019s worrying isn\u2019t that Trump is now getting advice about policy from fanatics like John Bolton and Lawrence Kudlow. Trump has never cared about policy. The real worry is that \u2013 with Robert Mueller breathing down his neck, and several special elections suggesting a giant \u201cblue wave\u201d in November \u2013 Trump is getting ready to do whatever it takes to maintain his power, even if that requires fanatical policies. Trump is preparing for an epic war over the future of his presidency. This has required purging naysayers from his Cabinet and White House staff, and replacing them with bomb-throwing advocates like Bolton and Kudlow. Fox News is preparing for the same war, and has made a parallel purge \u2013 removing Trump critics like George Will, Megyn Kelly, and Rich Lowry, and installing Trump marketers like Laura Ingraham, Mark Levin, and Sebastian Gorka. Trump and Fox News are also approaching the war with the same story. Some of it is by now familiar: Liberals have opened America to hostile forces \u2013 unauthorized immigrants, Muslims, Chinese traders, criminal gangs, drug dealers, government bureaucrats, coastal elites (Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi), North Korea, Iran, and \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d in all its forms. Trump intends to protect America from these forces. The new twist to the story\u2013 requiring the recent purges and a united front \u2013 is that these forces are conspiring with the FBI to oust Trump from the presidency. The membrane separating Trump\u2019s brain from Fox News has always been thin, but in coming months it\u2019s likely to disappear entirely. We all know Trump watches an inordinate amount of Fox News, beginning in the wee hours with \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d which provides much of the fodder for his morning tweets. Trump has made John Bolton his National Security Advisor not because Bolton has valuable insights about foreign affairs, but because Bolton \u2013 for years, an on-air fixture on Fox News \u2013 is a showman who knows how to sell big lies and crazy ideas, and thereby help Trump in the looming battles. As undersecretary of state for arms control in the Bush administration Bolton did more than anyone else to market the lie that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. During his year and a half at the United Nations, Bolton was so outspokenly critical of the organization that he gained the devotion of xenophobic conservatives. It hasn\u2019t hurt that Bolton has sucked up to Trump since then. Describing Trump\u2019s address last year to the United Nations, Bolton swooned \u201cin the entire history of the United Nations, there has never been a more straightforward criticism of the unacceptable behavior of other member states.\u201d Kudlow isn\u2019t a Fox News pundit but he\u2019s been the next best thing \u2013 a rightwing CNBC contributor known for his sharp wit and salesmanship. Several other cable news anchors and pundits are already in the Trump administration or will soon be, providing additional ammunition for Trump\u2019s pending war. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for people who are ready to be part of that television White House,\u201d says Kendall Phillips, a communication studies professor at Syracuse University. \u201cThis is the Fox television presidency all the way up and down.\u201d How can a television presidency be dangerous? Because it is solely about marketing Trump. Its only goal is to win. It is unconstrained by truth, reason, or the Constitution. It doesn\u2019t give a fig about the public. When the occupant of the White House and the sycophants surrounding him are prepared to do and use anything \u2013 including trade wars with China and possibly hot wars with North Korea and Iran \u2013 to win a political war at home, nothing and no one is safe.","label":1}
{"text":"Bannon's brutal ouster from Trump and Breitbart circles should frighten Americans: Breitbart News has announced that Steve Bannon is stepping down from his position as executive chairman of the conservative-leaning news organization. Rob Smith (@robsmithonline) has all the details! Buzz60 Conservative institutions have embraced Bannon's political slaughter not for his past sins but because he criticized the president. That's chilling. Steve Bannon \u2014 the loathed architect of President Trump\u2019s alt-right hate machine, Breitbart lies, racism, misogyny and Twitter thug troll factory \u2014 is banished to political Siberia. It was swift and decisive. Bannon is a deplorable human being who has no business being in a position of power or having the ear of any lawmaker. But as deplorable as he may be, his destruction by Trump and the sycophantic army Bannon helped incubate should frighten every American. Why? Because it\u2019s not why he was taken down and kicked to the curb. The former top campaign strategist, former National Security Council member (appointed by Trump) and former Breitbart News chairman has been given the heave-ho by pretty much the entire Trump establishment. Yet just days ago, he was king and kingmaker, second only to Trump, and viewed by many as Trump\u2019s Svengali. More: Trump team collusion with Russia? Ukraine connection may hold key. More: Michael Wolff book: Bannon's downfall with Trump, Breitbart and the Mercers? At Breitbart, Bannon created an online haven \u2014 a fertile safe space \u2014 for white nationalists and anti-Semites. Then he mobilized them behind a reality show host\/failed casino owner\/conspiracy theorist buffoon who won the GOP presidential nomination, largely because his outrageous clown show was ratings gold. Many right-wing media figures, authors and commentators had made their fame and fortune with a Clinton in the White House. They likely wanted a repeat of that success and no doubt believed a Trump nomination ensured a Hillary Clinton win. I\u2019m guessing more than a few publishers have a stale anti-President Hillary book proposal or two gathering dust in a drawer. Bannon openly campaigned to tear down American institutions, the Republican Party and the government. His white nationalism was first ignored, then tolerated and even welcomed by some. When Trump brought him to the White House as a top aide, Bannon's appointment was cheered by leaders of the Ku Klux Klan, the American Nazi Party and other white nationalist groups. Backed by the power of enormous amounts of money from the uber-wealthy Mercers, Bannon and Breitbart were being normalized. They worked to normalize Trump. Such was Bannon\u2019s ability to infiltrate society with his and Trump\u2019s morally reprehensible attitudes, they both vigorously campaignedfor Alabama's Senate candidate Roy Moore \u2014 who was credibly accused by multiple women of molesting them when they were adolescents and teens. Moore led in the polls for weeks before his defeat. Bannon is now ruined because in a few moments of uncharacteristic truth-telling to Fire and Fury author Michael Wolff, he shared the identical sentiments and concerns as his colleagues and most of his fellow citizens. He described suspicions and assumptions that nearly all of Washington, the press corps, Congress and many Americans share: that Trump knew full well his relatives and staff were meeting in Trump Tower with the Russians to get dirt on Hillary Clinton. Conspiracy and collusion. Let that sink in for a moment. When Bannon promoted white nationalism, misogyny, an accused child molester, severe online bullying and conspiracy theories, he was a king to the right-wing media, Trump and most of the Republicans in Congress. But when he dared to tell the truth, when confirmation from an insider could help save the country from the danger, Bannon was cut out like a member of Tony Soprano\u2019s \u201cfamily\u201d who turned state\u2019s evidence. It\u2019s one thing for Trump to cut off ties to Bannon. But the wholesale embracing of Bannon\u2019s political slaughter by conservative institutions for this, rather than for his past ugly sins, is quite another. Finally, dropped by the Mercers, and by extension and formally by Breitbart, Bannon is now a man without a country, friends or home. That conveys an ominous message: Do not criticize this American president or you will be destroyed. More: Trump's 'stable genius' reality check: America, this isn't a drill POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media It doesn\u2019t matter who is the target, or that our disgust toward the likes of Bannon is appropriate and well-earned. The swiftness and robot-like precision with which Trump\u2019s allies dislodged their lips from Bannon\u2019s MAGA derriere, so they could effectively reach for their shivs upon orders from Trump, is chilling. Not one White House staffer has publicly questioned whether Bannon\u2019s words rang true. Not one Republican senator has suggested publicly that perhaps we should pay heed to Bannon\u2019s words to Wolff. No one at Breitbart, or the Mercers, or the Republican National Committee or even Bannon\u2019s Gilligan to his Skipper, Corey Lewandowski, seems curious about what Bannon said \u2014 and if it\u2019s true, what danger the country may be in. The only concern is to protect and cover for Trump at all costs. Even so, Bannon and others who \u201cknow too much\u201d can be dangerous to a president with a few too many secrets. Trump would be wise to heed this advice: Never put anyone in a position where they\u2019ve got nothing left to lose.

Salacious, unproven dirty dossier by Spy-who-cut-and-run Christopher Steele The Mueller investigation is based on a salacious, unproven dirty dossier by Spy-who-cut-and-run Christopher Steele. Steele, who went underground, leaving his cats with a neighbour when his cover was blown, raked in mega bucks for a made-up story, and would likely still be cashing FBI checks if his cover hadn\u2019t been blown. Part of his leaked dossier purported that Donald Trump hired a pair of prostitutes to soak a bed Barack and Michelle Obama once shared at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Moscow, Russia, in urine. Throwing the Obamas into the picture was bound to bring progressive\/left hyenas out on the stampede. Now that the Washington Post outed Clinton and the DNC as the main principals behind the dossier, accusations are boomeranging back to the Republicans as its originators.  \u201cIn October 2015, during the Republican primary campaign, the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website primarily funded by Republican donor Paul Singer, hired the American research firm Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research on Trump and other Republican presidential candidates. For months, Fusion GPS gathered information about Trump, focusing on his business and entertainment activities. When Trump became the presumptive nominee on May 3, 2016, the Free Beacon stopped funding research on him.

CNN has been holding the Internet world in suspension over the weekend with a \u201cscoop\u201d spoon-fed to them by \u201canonymous sources\u201d within the Special Counsel Team. Putting their bragging rights on full display, the network claimed in a Friday night bombshell: \u201cAs of publication, every other media outlet reporting the story is reporting it back to CNN.\u201d According to their latest arrogant stance, the entire media died leaving CNN boss. Only the anti-Trump-crazed CNN would call Mueller\u2019s being prepared to make first charges on the year-long hunt for Trump campaign Russian colluders, \u201ca scoop\u201d. Readers and viewers call it what it really is: \u201cspoon-fed propaganda fed by \u201canonymous sources\u201d in the Deep State to what has long been their favorite \u201cnews\u201d outlet.

Salacious, unproven dirty dossier by Spy-who-cut-and-run Christopher Steele The Mueller investigation is based on a salacious, unproven dirty dossier by Spy-who-cut-and-run Christopher Steele. Steele, who went underground, leaving his cats with a neighbour when his cover was blown, raked in mega bucks for a made-up story, and would likely still be cashing FBI checks if his cover hadn\u2019t been blown. Part of his leaked dossier purported that Donald Trump hired a pair of prostitutes to soak a bed Barack and Michelle Obama once shared at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Moscow, Russia, in urine. Throwing the Obamas into the picture was bound to bring progressive\/left hyenas out on the stampede. Now that the Washington Post outed Clinton and the DNC as the main principals behind the dossier, accusations are boomeranging back to the Republicans as its originators.  \u201cIn October 2015, during the Republican primary campaign, the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website primarily funded by Republican donor Paul Singer, hired the American research firm Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research on Trump and other Republican presidential candidates. For months, Fusion GPS gathered information about Trump, focusing on his business and entertainment activities. When Trump became the presumptive nominee on May 3, 2016, the Free Beacon stopped funding research on him. (Wikipedia) \u2018\u201cShortly after the presidential election, Senator John McCain, who had been informed about the alleged links between the Kremlin and Trump, met with former British ambassador to Moscow Sir Andrew Wood. Wood confirmed the existence of the dossier and vouched for Steele\u2019s \u201cprofessionalism and integrity\u201d. McCain obtained the dossier from David J. Kramer and took it directly to FBI director James Comey on December 9, 2016\u201d.

{"text":"The sickness of Russian collusion-projection: Subscribe to Canada Free Press for FREE Let us assemble the new facts that we have from the Uranium One scandal, as it is called, and how they relate to the Russian collusion investigation being led by Special Counsel\/Prosecutor Robert Mueller and his 16 high-powered and well-paid Democrat-leaning lawyers. Tipped off by a confidential informer, in 2009 the FBI started collecting evidence that \u201c showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\u201d Evidence also indicated that higher level Russian officials had given millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation \u2013 Bill and Hillary\u2019s charitable organization \u2013 during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served in office, and on a government body called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. In 2010, Secretary Clinton, along with other board members, unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, which gave Russia control of more than 20 percent of the U.S.\u2019s uranium supply. Uranium is, of course, crucial to the production of nuclear weapons, which both the U.S., and Russia, have in huge abundance. This makes the whole Uranium One scandal a major national security problem. In 2010, even having all the above evidence, the FBI and the Department of Justice did nothing but continue to investigate. Four more years passed, until, finally, one of the Russian participants was charged and convicted of a single charge of money laundering for the scheme that stretched from 2004 to 2014. Another year passed before the DoJ finally issued a press release on the situation. Prominent FBI officials, and leading congressmen on the Republican side (which controlled the U.S. House beginning in 2011), were never fully briefed on the case. You will never guess which prominent names were part of the FBI\/DoJ investigation. Robert Mueller, who now serves as Special Counsel\/Prosecutor of the Russian Collusion investigation, was the director of the FBI from 2009 through 2013. He had to know about the Uranium One investigation. James Comey, Mueller\u2019s successor as FBI Director, took over in 2013, staying till he was fired by Trump earlier this year. He also had to know of the Uranium One investigation. Andrew McCabe, who was then an Assistant FBI Director but now is Deputy Director, led the Uranium One investigation on the FBI side, while then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, appointed to that position by President Obama, and who now serves as deputy attorney general under President Trump, led the prosecution team. As deputy attorney general, Rosenstein has the distinction of appointing Robert Mueller as Special Counsel for the Russian Collusion investigation after James Comey\u2019s leaks persuaded Rosenstein to ignore proper DoJ procedures that mandate that there be an underlying criminal matter being investigated prior to the appointment of a special counsel. Mind you, the Russian Collusion investigation is a counter-intelligence investigation, and not a criminal investigation, so such an investigation was simply not merited at the time, although the Mueller team have since annexed other criminal matters, such as the investigation of alleged Turkish bribes to former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. And, of course, Hillary Clinton, then-Secretary of State, and eventually the 2016 Democrat nominee for president, who the day after her unexpected loss to Trump hatched the Russia hacking propaganda story that led directly to the Russian Collusion investigation, was the one who took the alleged bribes for Uranium One. So, when it comes to the Uranium One scandal, we have here a situation where all these characters may have been implicated in a real Russian bribery scandal, largely unprosecuted \u2013 except one man \u2013 despite loads of evidence, which transferred U.S. uranium to Russian control. But, instead of suffering any penalties for their unwillingness to protect U.S. national security interests, these individuals have turned the tables, and are going after President Donald Trump for his supposed collusion with Putin to \u201chack\u201d the election. All with virtually no evidence for the Russian Collusion investigation. There is a name for such a sickness. In psychology, there is the idea of \u201cprojection.\u201d \u201cProjection is a psychological defense mechanism in which individuals attribute characteristics they find unacceptable in themselves to another person.\u201d Hillary Clinton, Robert Mueller, James Comey, Rod Rosenstein, and Andrew McCabe are guilty of projection.

{"text":"Why you shouldn\u2019t purchase two one-way tickets to save money: Many travel sites claim you can sometimes save money by booking two one-way tickets instead of a round-trip ticket. But is there a downside to this practice? Sharon Sanborn recently discovered that the answer to that question is a resounding yes. Sanborn\u2019s case points to the fact that if you decide to try this \u201ctravel hack,\u201d it is a bit of a gamble and you may end up losing. Squaremouth helps travelers easily and instantly compare travel insurance policies from all major providers. Only companies that meet the strict requirements of Squaremouth\u2019s Zero Complaint Guarantee are available on the website. Compare policies on Squaremouth.com to save over 70 percent on your next purchase. Buying two one-way tickets \u201cI purchased a ticket for my granddaughter on Delta with a return on United a week later,\u201d she told our advocates in her request for help. \u201cDelta canceled the outbound flight entirely and my granddaughter could not get to Colorado Springs. So I want United to give me a refund.\u201d When an airline cancels your flight, it is perfectly reasonable to expect a refund for that flight. But there were multiple complications with Sanborn\u2019s ticket, which ultimately prevented her from receiving reimbursement for that return segment. First, she purchased her granddaughter\u2019s ticket through Travelocity. In doing so, she immediately added a layer of difficulty to any issues that were encountered with the reservation. Booking directly with the airlines will always make any problems you may encounter with your ticket easier to rectify. Two different airlines Next, she purchased an itinerary that Travelocity created by combining two one-way tickets on two different airlines. The way Travelocity confirmed Sanborn\u2019s reservation could give an infrequent traveler the impression of having purchased a single, contiguous ticket \u2014 if one part were to be canceled by the airline, the entire ticket could be refunded. However, at the bottom of the reservation, Travelocity spells out the terms of the ticket and clarifies: \u201cWe have combined two one-way tickets to get the best deal. If you need to make changes or cancel, you\u2019ll need to do it twice \u2014 once for each one-way ticket.\u201d Two separate tickets What it doesn\u2019t explicitly spell out is that if the traveler needs to cancel this nonrefundable ticket, two cancellation fees will be accessed. And if the airline cancels one of the flights, there is no policy or protection by which the traveler can ask for a refund of the other unrelated flight. If Sanborn had purchased this ticket as a round-trip flight on the same airline, she would have qualified for a full refund of the cost of the ticket. Because she didn\u2019t, she only received a refund of the canceled Delta ticket. She was then stuck with the nonrefundable return flight, which had a hefty cancellation fee. The cancellation fee essentially made that one-way ticket worthless, and Sanborn lost several hundred dollars. The bad news In the end, we couldn\u2019t help Sanborn recoup her losses. The way she purchased this ticket through Travelocity made it impossible. You may find savings by booking two one-way tickets. However, before doing so, you should weigh the cost and benefits against the potential loss that could result. Because it\u2019s a gamble that you may not win.

{"text":"Does the U.S. President\u2019s Dog Get Its Own Secret Service Agents?: Ryan asks: If the president has a pet dog, do their bodyguards also watch over his dog like they do his family?  Even before the U.S. president is elected such, if they\u2019re considered a \u201cmajor candidate\u201d for the job, they get offered Secret Service protection. Whether they accept that protection or not, once elected until the day they die (unless they opt out after leaving office), they will be shadowed by an elite team of Secret Service agents. These individuals, while not actually sworn to do so (contrary to popular belief), are generally expected to, if necessary, give their lives to keep the president safe. While in office, this protection extends to a president\u2019s immediate family. But does this ever include their family pet? Technically no. According to former Secret Service agent Dan Emmett, as noted in his book Within Arm\u2019s Length, the agents tasked with protecting the First Family are under no obligation to protect any pets said family may own. In fact, he noted that even beyond not directly having any obligation to protect the animals, \u201cWalking the dog or cat is not and will never be a part of an agent\u2019s job description.\u201d Emmett put this little tidbit in a section of his book specifically dispelling myths about the Secret Service. This is a section that humourously enough also includes this gem of a supposedly widely held myth:  Myth: All women are attracted to Secret Service agents.  Emmett goes on to explain that the truth is actually that only \u201cMany women are attracted to Secret Service agents\u2026\u201d (Presumably to ones called Dan Emmett most of all.) On top of this, he states that the life of a Secret Service agent includes a  never-ending string of temptations sometimes literally thrust into one\u2019s face by women who are impressed by such things as men who protect the president. It can be almost frightening at times when seated in a bar, and a woman recognizes and agent she has just seen on television with the president. On more than one occasion, my shift mates and I had phone numbers and hotel room keys shoved into our hands or thrown to us while working a rope line with the president\u2026. For the single agent, it was paradise; for many married agents, it was a constant struggle between good and evil, which was sometimes won and other times lost.  Back to literal dogs (as opposed to the cheating kind)- although the Secret Service isn\u2019t obligated by any means to walk or take care of the president\u2019s pet dog or cat (Emmett tersely claims that White House custodial staff do this), it doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t necessarily do it. For example, Bo and Sunny, the pet Portuguese Water Dogs of the Obama\u2019s, were often pictured being taken for a walk by some member of Obama\u2019s protective detail. Given there were presumably other staff available for the task when necessary, we can only assume they did this because of scenarios like that the president was in the midst of doing so himself when called away for a moment (so they had to take over temporarily), and perhaps because they liked to walk the dogs, so weren\u2019t quick to call other White House staff in. After all, it stands to reason that Secret Service agents who spend a lot of time around the president would occasionally grow fond of the president\u2019s pets, assuming they liked the type of animal, and thus wouldn\u2019t mind the occasional pet detail. Said agents have also been known to do such things as a favor to the president. For instance, the Secret Service agents tasked with protecting Ronald Reagan after he left office occasionally ran around Reagan\u2019s ranch with his dogs when the former President was physically unable to do so. In all such cases, one would think, despite not being obligated to, they\u2019d even potentially help protect the pet if necessary. Sure, maybe not protect them with their lives as they\u2019re expected to do with the human members of the family, but presumably they\u2019d give it their best go if someone tried to pull a canine assassination or the animal was going to be hit by a car or something. In fact, the Secret Service is known to actively take precautions to keep a president\u2019s pet(s) safe at least in some cases, including things like muzzling their own attack and guard dogs when they\u2019re around the pet(s). And while Emmett never mentioned it, keeping track of the president\u2019s more mobile pets must be somewhat of a priority given that presidential pets are generally given near total freedom to come and go as they please and have essentially unlimited access to the president. First Dogs then arguably have more power than most of the president\u2019s own advisers, seeing as they can walk into his office any time and lick his face without upsetting him (something we presume only the First Lady, or certain interns of yore, could otherwise get away with). Why would the Secret Service care what said animals get up to? This unscreened freedom of access is potentially a major security risk if the animal in question wasn\u2019t being well kept track of. After all, someone could potentially get an explosive device or the like within a large enough dog (perhaps forcing or otherwise coercing them to swallow it or\u2026 you know, insert it into the other end). Beyond this, pathogens, toxic substances, etc. could be clandestinely planted on or in the animal\u2019s fur in the hopes the president would soon after pet the animal. So presumably the Secret Service keeps tabs on that it is at least somebody\u2019s job to ensure the animals that have unrestricted access to the president and their family never ventures into unsecured locations or the like, even if it\u2019s not the Secret Service\u2019s job specifically to keep track of the animal(s). (And yes, very unfortunately so-called \u201csuicide bomber animals\u201d are occasionally a thing, one of the more famous cases of this being the sad tale of The Exploding Anti-Tank Dogs of World War II.) On a lighter note, it should be noted that beyond having people wait on you paw and paw and having the ability to poop in the Oval Office, being the president\u2019s animal also has other perks, including potentially a pardon from any crime you may commit. You might think that last one sounds like a joke, but it\u2019s only partially so. For instance, in 2008, President Bush\u2019s beloved dog, Barney, bit two people- Heather Walker, public relations director for the Boston Celtics who got her wrist bitten, and Jonathan Decker, a Reuters reporter who got his finger nipped. Given the many and diverse microbial flora that call a dog\u2019s mouth home (yes, contrary to popular belief, a dog\u2019s mouth isn\u2019t anywhere close to \u201ccleaner\u201d than a human\u2019s), the pair were given antibiotics to prevent potentially dangerous infection as part of their treatment. For any other dog, such repeated behavior may well have resulted in it being put down, whether the owners wished it or not. However, even without the presidential pardon \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card, there are not many individuals who want to risk becoming near universally hated for pursuing the matter of getting the president\u2019s dog \u201cput to sleep\u201d. Of course, if such a bitten individual tried, it would be interesting to see if the presidential pardon powers legally extend to animals\u2026 (And if you\u2019re curious: Why Do Presidents Get to Pardon People at the End of Their Terms?) If you liked this article, you might also enjoy our new popular podcast, The BrainFood Show ( iTunes, Spotify, Google Play Music, Feed), as well as: Bonus Facts: Over the years a vast array of unusual and exotic animals have lived in the White House including a pair of alligators (owned by Herbert Hoover) and a raccoon, a bear and a pygmy hippo (all owned by Calvin Coolidge and his family). Many Presidents have given their pets unusual or odd names. Coolidge, for example, owned a lion called Tax Reduction, whereas William McKinley owned a parrot called Washington Post\u2026 Lyndon B. Johnson was notably more pragmatic in this regard, simply naming his two beagles Him and Her. Donald Trump is the first President in over a century to not own a dog. As of 2013 after President Obama signed the Former Presidents Protection Act of 2012 into law, former Presidents and their spouse are entitled to 24\/7 secret service protection for the rest of their lives. This was actually the standard protocol from 1965 to 1996 but was changed to a 10 year period for any President in office after 1997. President Obama saw fit to repeal this change, meaning no President alive today has gone without Secret Service protection since leaving office (unless they voluntarily opt out). Under the law, the protection extends only to a President and their spouse, although a President\u2019s children will similarly receive Secret Service protection until they reach the age of 16.

{"text":"Politician Was Told Her Hair Was Unprofessional And To Fear Rape On Campaign Trail: Credit: Samanthah Maina When Samanthah Maina headed out onto the campaign trail with her majority-female team these past few months to gather signatures, she believed that she was ready. She had her platform down, was ready for questions about her political qualifications, and even prepared to battle accusations that she was an independent and not a member of a political party. As a woman, it\u2019s already very hard to convince the male-dominated country\u2019s inhabitants that she is fit to be a member of the assembly, but she discounted just how difficult it would be. Maina is running for a seat in the Members of County Assembly for the Kileleshwa Ward in Kenya; assembly members bridge the gap between citizens and county lawmakers, so working with citizens is essential to the seat she\u2019s aiming for. That\u2019s why political aspirants need to gather 500 signatures to even vie for a seat in the assembly, causing Maina to head out on the road to speak with community members about the issues their facing, give information about her platform, and hopefully gain more signatures and supporters. What Maina wasn\u2019t ready for was the explicit and implicit sexist comments and actions that she would be forced to endure when speaking with many citizens. The 26-year-old faced comments and questions about her hair, which some people said was unprofessional and unlike the hair of a politician, her marital status, whether she was running for office to sell cosmetics, and why she didn\u2019t have a bodyguard to protect her and her team from rape while out on the streets. \u201cIn my head I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Why would I choose politics to sell my looks?\u2019\u201d she told BuzzFeed News. \u201cI\u2019ll go for Miss Kenya, right? Not politics.\u201d In a Twitter thread, the political aspirant voiced her concerns for what she faced.  1.There's is something about campaigning door to door as a young female candidate that i need to talk about. \u2014 Samanthah Maina (@samantha_maina_) June 22, 2017   2.My campaign team consists of majorly females, and all of us are afraid let me explain. The use of language. \u2014 Samanthah Maina (@samantha_maina_) June 22, 2017   3. Especially the uncensored way in which sexual intonations are easily paraded. It's no secret we interact with men on the campaign trail. \u2014 Samanthah Maina (@samantha_maina_) June 22, 2017   4. They are not shy to insinuate that rape incidences are rampant and its unsafe to walk around as females door to door. \u2014 Samanthah Maina (@samantha_maina_) June 22, 2017   5.To understand this man in particular, we ask him what he means rape is high.In a nutshell he say you are young, beautiful\u2026 \u2014 Samanthah Maina (@samantha_maina_) June 22, 2017   \u2026and risk of rape is high. We were left dumbfounded. Because how to convo went from selling our agendas to rape was 0-100. \u2014 Samanthah Maina (@samantha_maina_) June 22, 2017   6. We couldn't believe, young and beautiful is a recipe for rape. This is why we are scared, despite our door to door campaigns fear is real \u2014 Samanthah Maina (@samantha_maina_) June 22, 2017   7.Even when taking pics, no repeat for personal space. They hold your waist just a little too low, a little too tight and too close. \u2014 Samanthah Maina (@samantha_maina_) June 22, 2017   8.In moments like these you're expected to smile even though inwardly there's mixed feelings around how close this man has held you. \u2014 Samanthah Maina (@samantha_maina_) June 22, 2017   9. They say being a politician tests your will to serve but no one prepares you for the way in which your worst fears stare you in the eye. \u2014 Samanthah Maina (@samantha_maina_) June 22, 2017   10. The team is cautious as we walk, but honestly we need to feel safe. The casual way in which our bodies are spoken about to our faces\u2026 \u2014 Samanthah Maina (@samantha_maina_) June 22, 2017   11. \u2026is not something we should be facing. Our safety on the ground as women politicians is deeply wanting.. @scheafferoo \u2014 Samanthah Maina (@samantha_maina_) June 22, 2017  Her words have resonated with countless women not only in Kenya but across the globe, as sexism, rape culture, and gender parity have made their way onto the radar of politics. Kenya\u2019s current parliament is made up of roughly 20% of women, and to combat this they passed an article in their constitution in 2010 that would require women to make up one-third of parliament, but enforcement of the article has been lacking. The article was in response to outrage from citizens and the efforts made by neighboring countries; Rwanda, for example, has a parliament where women make up 64% of the members. In Kenya, sexism, lack of funding, sexual assault, and fear of violence are all holding back the push to put more women in office. Their hesitation to enforce the mandate nearly caused a government shutdown just a few months ago, but authorities are worried that even more riots and uprisings will occur if the article takes effect. Credit: Samanthah Maina Maina is not the first nor will she be the last woman to face discrimination and overtly sexist questions while running for office. One environmental champion and Nobel Peace Prize winner was stripped of her chance at the presidency with a crude rumor, another had condoms thrown around her campaign site after it was raided to ruin her reputation, and the male opponent of a female gubernatorial candidate said that she was \u201c so beautiful, everybody wants to rape her.\u201d Despite this comment being well-known and the talk show he was so supposed to appear on being canceled, his race for the governorship continues. What Maina faces is so common that it\u2019s frightening, and that\u2019s why she and her team are in fear whenever they go out. But she urges other females to also run for office because of the importance of representation in the government.  \u201cIt will test you on every front: emotionally, psychologically,\u201d Maina said about running for office. \u201cYou might lose weight, or gain weight from the stress. We talk about representation, but we can\u2019t shy away because it\u2019s going to be a bit tough. There\u2019s not going to be a perfect time.\u201d ","label":1}
{"text":"Hate On The Far Left Is Just As Dangerous As Hate On The Far Right: In his Forward column outlining \u201c19 People Jews Should Worry About More Than Linda Sarsour,\u201d Steven Davidson says that with so many other dangers lurking, he is confounded by the Jewish community\u2019s seeming obsession with the controversial Palestinian-American feminist activist. I share Davidson\u2019s horror at the presence of figures such as Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka in the Oval Office. I worry deeply, too, about \u201calt-right\u201d or \u201calt-lite\u201d figures such as Richard Spencer. And yet even with the increasing anti-Semitism, racism, xenophobia and other forms of hatred we are experiencing, I do worry more about Linda Sarsour than about most of the people on Davidson\u2019s list \u2014 at least those involved in domestic American politics. After all, most of the list\u2019s other individuals are known anti-Semites and bigots, fringe figures reviled by significant swaths of the American public. The issue with Linda Sarsour is that she and many of her colleagues on the far left, including some in the LGBTQ community, are creating a false litmus test for progressive activism, one saying that if you are truly progressive you can\u2019t be a Zionist. And, she is doing that with the aura of mainstream acceptability conferred by her Jewish allies and other prominent supporters for whom I generally have tremendous respect. American Jews have been at the vanguard of progressive justice movements for more than a century. Being shunned by these movements because of their support for a Jewish state in Israel is devastating, particularly for those who have devoted countless time and energy to advocating for peace and self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians. Sarsour and others present a false \u201ceither-or\u201d choice for politically liberal Jews. When push comes to shove, many younger Jews could feel compelled to stifle their Jewish and Zionist identities in order to continue to be accepted in the social and activist circles they hold dear, whether advocating for LGBTQ rights, an end to police brutality and racial profiling, or preservation of reproductive choice. That is a much longer-term danger than any \u201calt-right\u201d agitator is. On a personal level, I was outraged and pained when Sarsour declared that it is impossible for a woman to be both a Zionist and a feminist. Really? How fortunate that I was unaware of this edict: From my college days organizing students to attend pro-choice rallies in Washington, D.C., to previously directing a Jewish women\u2019s foundation that supports social change projects for Jewish and non-Jewish women and girls in Israel and the United States, my identities as a Jew, a progressive Zionist and a feminist have been seamlessly interwoven. When did Linda Sarsour and other anti-Israel leftists become supreme gatekeepers, determining who may rightfully sit at the table of those who fight for justice and tolerance and equality? According to Sarsour, Zionism is never compatible with human decency, thereby ignoring that Israel itself was created out of the ashes of perhaps the worst genocidal crime in human history. One just as easily could say that she is the one who should be dismissed from that table because of her willful denial that the essential human propensity toward anti-Semitism \u2014 a scourge that continues to flourish around the world and in our own backyards \u2014 created the urgent moral imperative to establish and sustain a Jewish state in our ancestral homeland in the first place. Jews have a rightful place at that table because of our identities as Zionist Jews, not despite it. We must raise our collective voice to stake this claim proudly and authentically. If we can\u2019t get this message across, both to our own people and to our allies in the social justice arena, we will find ourselves ostracized from the very movements that we have so proudly championed and led for decades. In the process, we could potentially lose a chunk of younger generations of liberal American Jews. Hence, the \u201cSarsour hysteria\u201d that Davidson finds so baffling. Thankfully, we need not choose between combatting white supremacists and combatting those who deny Israel\u2019s right to existence. We must do both, calling out hatred on both the far right and the far left. They are all equally deserving of our righteous anger.

{"text":"The Quadruplets First Trip To Disneyland: This has been a dream of ours since we started talking about our family! Ashley and I both love Disneyland so much! There are so many fond memories there for both us from our childhood, as well as from our marriage. We\u2019ve spent time with parents, friends and siblings enjoying all things magical, and experiencing a dream world that makes you feel like everything is going to be alright! That being said, nothing was going to prepare us for how magical it actually was taking our own children and seeing the magic through their eyes! We booked the Courtyard Marriot at the entrance to the park. We knew if we needed a quick escape, this was going to be crucial for us not having to walk too far. It was so perfect! Not only were the rooms spacious and clean, but the service was excellent! When we were being checked in, they found out we had quads. They immediately gave all the girls little whale stuffed animals from underneath the counter. Obviously they did this with all kids, but after a long morning drive, the girls certainly appreciated it! Also seeing our circumstance, they checked us in early and made sure we were all settled before heading over to park! Big shout out to Paige who took such great care of us! If anyone is looking for lodging, definitely recommend these guys! Planning for the excitement was one thing, but I thought we were crazy if we didn\u2019t think of the other end of the spectrum! Obviously taking four 2 year olds to Disneyland required some extra thought! Were they going to hold up in the summer weather? Did we need to pack extra diaper bags? Did we need to bring a cooler? Were they going to stay in their strollers? If not, would we physically be able to keep track of them? Would they like the rides? Are you starting to get a glimpse of all the worries we had going into the park? Having Madison and Oakland on the trip with us really put most of these questions to bed! For instance they did want to get out of the strollers quite often, but having one adult per child really made this a non-worry issue! By the time we got there on the first day, it was lunchtime. What else but corn dogs! We kept them super hydrated throughout the day! What I love about Disney is you can get ice water at pretty much any of their restaurants free of charge! This was HUGE for us with the kiddos! Although the weather was pretty warm, the stroller canopies and ice water on walks helped tremendously! As soon as we took the kids on their first ride, I knew this trip was going to be a success! We actually started them out on an adult ride, Pirates of the Caribbean! This is one of our favorite rides, and our thought process was if they completely hated it, we could always move to the more kid friendly rides. But we didn\u2019t even need to worry, because all 4 of them completely loved the ride; even to the point of singing \u201cYo-ho\u201d for several minutes after the ride! They loved being on a boat as well. Even today when we talk about Disney asking them what their favorite ride was, we usually get a \u201cboat\u201d answer from one of them! Everything else was downhill after the first ride! They absolutely loved all the amusement around them! We did Haunted Mansion, which they loved. I think my love of Fall and Halloween helped prepare them for this. The Dumbo ride, Pooh ride, and Pinnochio were all hits! That being said, I don\u2019t think anything topped Small World. They fell in love with this ride, and we fell in love with their excitement and fondness for the ride. What once was Ashley\u2019s least favorite ride, now became a family favorite! Esme didn\u2019t know what to think of the whale?? Are there 4 of them? This question never gets old! LOL. #esmefaces Evie\u2019s face just kills me in this photo! Smile on demand! The Carousel was definitely a highlight for the kids. They just lit up when they saw the horses, and wouldn\u2019t stop chattering until we actually put them on one! They loved it! The Disney Crew! Pie faces! Rides aside, I think the churros were the next big hit! The girls absolutely loved the Disney churros, but who doesn\u2019t. Indie was particularly fond to them, just like daddy! By the second day, we made our way over to California Adventure. The adults took turns riding the Grizzly Rapids, while the girls enjoyed snacks in the shade! The favorite ride over there had to be the Mater ride. The girls love all the tractors and trucks, to the point where they kept repeating those words for 20 minutes after the rides! Their excitement was electric, and contagious. We ran into some celebrities while at the park! Anyone remember Magnum P.I.? We enjoyed some restaurants and site seeing throughout both parks, and the girls overall were troopers for all the walking, warm weather, and schedule changes! Mickey Mouse Donuts, \u201cyes please\u201d!! On the second day, we wanted to make it to the firework show, so we started early, and planned a nap in the middle of the day. It went perfectly as we conquered much of Disneyland in the early morning, and then the girls took an incredible nap! Oak and Hugsy stayed an enjoyed the park while Mom an Dad worked during nap time. The girls slept til almost 5, which really was what allowed us to make the firework show at 930, and have the girls happy while doing so! It was a magical end to our Disney experience! Best part of the trip came on the second day. Meeting Mickey and Minnie! The girls absolutely loved this experience, but their faces tell you that! Overall, the girls were absolute troopers, not only for the 2 days at Disney, but for the entire California trip! We had such a wonderful experience watching them experience the magic of Disney for the first time! This was certainly the first of many more Disney trips to come! Hope you guys enjoyed this blog. Many more adventures to come! In the meantime, please enjoy a few of my favorite all time blogs below! -Tyson","label":0}

Yahoo! Sports reports the insurance policy could be signed prior to the regular season in the event Beckham doesn\u2019t land a lucrative long-term deal.  New York Giants star Odell Beckham Jr. will consider acquiring a massive insurance policy \u2013 possibly for more than $100 million in injury protection \u2013 if he doesn\u2019t reach a contract extension with the team before the NFL\u2018s regular season begins, two sources close to Beckham told Yahoo Sports. The sources said Beckham\u2019s camp explored injury insurance prior to Monday night, when a scary hit left the player with a sprained ankle in a preseason game against the Cleveland Browns. \u201c[If a deal isn\u2019t done] by the regular season, he\u2019ll take steps to protect himself. [But] a new deal is preferable to adding insurance,\u201d one source said.  Beckham said earlier this offseason that he aspires to be the highest-paid player in the NFL \u2014 a demand that didn\u2019t even cause a batted eye with Giants co-owner John Mara. \u201cHe deserves to get paid, we\u2019re going to pay him, it\u2019s just a question of when we enter into the contract, and I don\u2019t have a time table on it right now,\u201d Mara said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need to rush into it. He\u2019s going to end up getting paid at some point.\u201d A policy in excess of $100 million could cost Beckham upwards of $600,000 for the year. However, given that he\u2019s aiming for a contract larger than $100 million, it could potentially be a wise one-year investment for the superstar. Beckham, who is not actively engaged in contract talks with the Giants, went down on Monday night with what initially appeared to be a serious knee injury. However, following x-rays and further examination, it was determined Beckham had merely suffered a sprained ankle.  ","label":0}

However, the source says he is doing everything in his power to get back into Rasheeda\u2019s good graces. \u201cKirk is not giving up; he has a plan regardless of the paternity test,\u201d the source revealed. \u201cAll he cares about is getting Rasheeda back.\u201d  \u201cHe\u2019s been bending over backwards to take care of the kids so she can work on Pressed (her Atlanta boutique) and on her new music.

{"text":"Failing the children of California:  ANALYSIS\/OPINION: At the start of each new year we\u2019re subjected to a whole host of new laws. The modern liberal government, you see, imagines itself not as the champion of individual freedom but as Mommy and Daddy, a taskmaster charged with controlling your life. Most of the time, it makes everything, including our lives, worse. Case in point: California. Completely at the mercy of the left, which now controls two-thirds of the state government, California serves as a living illustration of what the left really wants to accomplish. As of Jan. 1, that includes decriminalizing what is commonly called \u201cchild prostitution.\u201d They may not have technically legalized it, but decriminalizing the act per se will have the same results, while putting exploited children in even more danger. First, let\u2019s make one thing clear right now: There is no such thing as \u201cchild prostitution.\u201d The fact is we\u2019re dealing with the sex trafficking of girls and boys. This isn\u2019t some horror reserved for Thailand or some other far-off place \u2014 it\u2019s happening right here in the United States. More than 1,000 children are arrested each year for prostitution, with estimates of sex trafficking involving 100,000 to 2.4 million children. Concerned Women for America reports, \u201cThe United States Department of Justice uses the number 293,000 as the estimate for youth \u2018at risk\u2019 of being commercially sexually exploited.\u201d The fact that these children are victims is not disputed, but what California has just done makes the problem even worse. A revelatory op-ed in the Washington Examiner by Travis Allen, one of the few Republicans in the California legislature, declaring the state had \u201clegalized\u201d child prostitution, made waves and garnered much-needed attention to the issue. Mr. Travis wrote, \u201cBeginning on Jan. 1, prostitution by minors will be legal in California. Yes, you read that right. SB 1322 bars law enforcement from arresting sex workers who are under the age of 18 for soliciting or engaging in prostitution, or loitering with the intent to do so. So teenage girls (and boys) in California will soon be free to have sex in exchange for money without fear of arrest or prosecution.\u201d So what can law enforcement in California do when they encounter a child selling themselves on the street for sex? The Sacramento Bee explains, \u201cCommercially sexually exploited children, based on the bill\u2019s analysis, may be taken into temporary custody \u2018if the minor has an immediate need for medical care, or \u2026 is in immediate danger of physical or sexual abuse, or the physical environment\u2019 or the child\u2019s unattended status \u2018poses an immediate threat to the child\u2019s health or safety.\u2019 \u201c The operative word here is, of course, \u201cimmediate.\u201d But don\u2019t worry \u2014 there is something the police must do. The Bee continued to defend the law by assuring readers, \u201cUnder the law, officers who encounter minors [selling themselves for sex] must report the circumstances to the county child welfare agency as abuse or neglect.\u201d That\u2019s right. They must report it to a government agency. So here\u2019s the truth of the matter: This law tells the police there is nothing they are allowed to do with a child obviously engaging in an act against his or her will; an act that amounts to rape once the child sells himself or herself to the stranger looking for a child to purchase. The obscenity of this law is clear: Not only does it tie the hands of law enforcement in removing the child from a threatening environment, it sends a message to the victimized children that their sex trafficker is in charge, that society accepts and allows what\u2019s happening, and ultimately, there is no escape. Mr. Travis notes, this vicious circle \u201ctranslates into bigger and better cash flow for the pimps. Simply put, more time on the street and less time in jail means more money for pimps, and more victims for them to exploit.\u201d Why would California put sex-trafficked children in such danger by tying the hands of law enforcement when there are alternatives to treating them like criminals? Several states already have legislation that managed to recognize the victim status of the children without abandoning them. Concerned Women for America reports, \u201cNew York and Washington State have laws that divert minors arrested for prostitution into services and rehabilitation programs at the discretion of the judge in New York and at the discretion of the prosecutor in Washington. \u2026 In Massachusetts, the law diverts minors found in prostitution into services and treatment but keeps the charges pending against them in place until they successfully complete the rehabilitation programs after which the charges are dropped.\u201d If you\u2019re serious about saving children, you don\u2019t limit what law enforcement can do, you expand their options while making sure children are treated as victims, while using the justice system as a way to remove them from their enslavement. Instead, the liberals who run California have just done the opposite, guaranteeing lives ruined while allowing an evil problem to continue virtually unchecked. \u2022 Tammy Bruce, author and Fox News contributor, is a radio talk show host.","label":1}
{"text":"FBI never contacted Wasserman Schultz after DNC breach, former chairwoman claims:  The former chair of the Democratic National Committee said Wednesday that the FBI never contacted her after Russian hackers breached the DNC\u2019s computer networks prior to last year\u2019s presidential race. \u201cAt no point during my tenure at the DNC did anyone from the FBI or any other government agency contact or communicate with me about Russian intrusion on the DNC network,\u201d Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cIt is astounding to me that the chair of an organization like the DNC was never contacted by the FBI or any other agency concerned about these intrusions,\u201d the Florida Democrat added, Politico reported. \u201cAs a member of Congress, I had the unique clearance to hear any classified briefing that would be involved in such an intrusion, and the FBI clearly should have come to me with that information. They did not.\u201d The former DNC chairwoman\u2019s remarks came within hours of a Wednesday morning congressional hearing during which former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson testified about the DNC breach and other offensive cyber activities attributed to Russian state-sponsored hackers. \u201cMy interest in helping them was definitely of nonpartisan interest, and I recall very clearly that I was not pleased that we were not in there helping them patch this vulnerability,\u201d Mr. Johnson said of the DNC. \u201cIf the FBI or any other government agency ever came to me with that information, I would have gladly welcomed their help,\u201d Ms. Wasserman Schultz responded afterwards. \u201cIn fact, back in March, former FBI Director [James] Comey testified that he wished he had personally done more to notify the DNC of the Russian intrusion.\u201d President Trump opined on the topic from his Twitter account early Thursday, tweeting: \u201cWhy did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI, and still hasn\u2019t? It\u2019s all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election!\u201d Ms. Wasserman Schultz resigned from her role as chairwoman last July after WikiLeaks published internal Democratic Party correspondence obtained during the DNC breach, including emails in which she expressed a bias against Sen. Bernard Sanders, Vermont independent and former White House hopeful, in favor of the party\u2019s eventual candidate, Hillary Clinton. Her interim replacement, Donna Brazile, was fired from her role as CNN contributor three months later after those same emails showed that she shared debate questions with Mrs. Clinton ahead of CNN-sponsored campaign events. The U.S. intelligence community has attributed the DNC breach and other related intrusions to a state-sponsored influence campaign targeting last year\u2019s White House race allegedly ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin in order to benefit Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Moscow has denied the accusations.","label":1}
{"text":"Lawsuit by Benghazi families targeting Hillary Clinton dismissed by Obama-appointed federal judge:  A federal judge on Friday dismissed a lawsuit brought against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by relatives of two Americans killed during the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya. Mrs. Clinton neither enabled the Benghazi attack by using her now-infamous private email server nor defamed its victims\u2019 parents afterwards, U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled Friday in Washington, D.C., casting aside claims raised on behalf of parents of slain State Department information officer Sean Smith and late CIA operative Tyrone Woods. The Smith and Woods families sued Mrs. Clinton last August in D.C. federal court alleging she caused their sons\u2019 deaths by discussing sensitive State Dept. matters over an insecure, nongovernmental email system while secretary of state, supposedly providing terrorists with information used to plot the Sept. 11, 2012 ambush, according to the lawsuit. Any emails sent by Mrs Clinton were within the scope of her position as secretary of state, the Obama-appointed judge ruled Friday, giving the court sufficient reason to dismiss the wrongful death claim on technical grounds, Politico first reported. \u201cThe Court finds that Secretary Clinton was acting in the scope of her employment when she transmitted the emails that are alleged to give rise to her liability,\u201d Judge Jackson\u2018s 29-page opinion reads in part. \u201cThe untimely death of plaintiffs\u2019 sons is tragic, and the Court does not mean to minimize the unspeakable loss that plaintiffs have suffered in any way. But when one applies the appropriate legal standards, it is clear that plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to rebut the presumption that Secretary Clinton was acting in her official capacity when she used her private email server.\u201d \u201cHer actions \u2013 communicating with other State Department personnel and advisors about the official business of the department \u2013 fall squarely within the scope of her duty to run the Department and conduct the foreign affairs of the nation as Secretary of State,\u201d Friday\u2019s ruling said. The lawsuit also claimed Mrs. Clinton defamed the Smith and Woods families after the Benghazi attack by allegedly misrepresenting conversations she had with either. Those claims were dismissed Friday as well. \u201cSecretary Clinton did not refer to plaintiffs as liars,\u201d Judge Jackson opined. \u201cPlaintiffs may find the candidate\u2019s statements in her own defense to be \u2018unpleasant or offensive,\u2019 but Secretary Clinton did not portray plaintiffs as \u2018odious, infamous, or ridiculous\u2026.\u2019 To the contrary, the statements portray plaintiffs as normal parents, grieving over the tragic loss of their loved ones.\u201d A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately react to the ruling, and an attorney for Mrs. Clinton declined to comment, Politico reported Friday. Four Americans in total were killed on Sept. 11, 2012, after terrorists stormed the U.S. consulate in Libya, including CIA operative Glen Doherty and U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens in addition to Smith and Woods.","label":1}
{"text":"Kimmel: My &quot;Duty&quot; To Oppose GOP Health Care Bill, Tell You To Call Your Senator: On the Thursday broadcast of his late-night program, Jimmy Kimmel once again went political and took on President Donald Trump, Republicans, and the Graham-Cassidy health care bill that would replace Obamacare. Kimmel said President Trump wants to get rid of Obamacare primarily because it has the former president's name attached to it. Kimmel joked, \"we haven't seen this many people come forward to speak against a bill since Cosby.\" \"I guarantee he doesn't know anything about this Graham-Cassidy bill. He doesn't know the difference between Medicare and Medicaid. He barely knows the difference between Melania and Ivanka,\" Kimmel said to laughter. RELATED: Kimmel Responds To Kilmeade's 'Hollywood Elite' Criticism: \"I'll Pound You When I See You\" Kimmel opened his show advocating against the bill and cited details that made him an opponent:  KIMMEL: Well, thanks for joining us on what has been an unusual week for us here at our show. If you've been watching over the past few days, and you haven't, I've found myself in the middle of a battle over American health care. After my son Billy had open heart surgery at the end of April, the [Republican] Senator Bill Cassidy from Louisiana came on our show, made some promises and assurances that he did not keep. The reason I had him on the show in the first place is because he started telling people that any plan he supports would have to pass what he called 'the Jimmy Kimmel test.' And then he teamed up with Senator Lindsey Graham to write a bill that most definitely does not pass that test. It doesn't protect people from having their rates jacked up for pre-existing conditions, doesn't prevent insurance companies from putting lifetime caps on how much they'll spend on a person with medical issues, and it cuts a huge amount of money, maybe hundreds of billions of dollars in health care funding. And Americans understandably, especially, do not like the idea of being priced out of insurance for a pre-existing condition.  Kimmel used his network soapbox to show how many medical organizations are against the Graham-Cassidy proposal which prompted the Bill Cosby joke. \"This plan is not a good thing,\" he argued. \"[Cassidy's] supporters say, he's a doctor and you're not, what do you know? To them I say, all of these very reputable organizations -- American Diabetes Association, American Medical Association, American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, the list goes on and on. All of these groups populated by doctors say this health care bill is bad. They're against it. We haven't seen this many people come forward to speak against a bill since Cosby. Okay?\" Kimmel also used his monologue to mock Vice President Mike Pence for arguing that states should be able to decide what they want to do, in this case with health care. \"Their argument that is it's better to put these decisions in the hands of the states. And have you seen some of our states? If Florida could make their own decisions, it would be legal to bring an alligator into a strip club,\" he joked. Kimmel used his monologue to call Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) an \"inbred\" after he said the host is a \"funny guy,\" but no one should confuse him with a \"well-respected health care expert.\" \"I wouldn't take advice from Charlie Sheen either,\" Kennedy added. Kimmel said he feels like it is his \"duty\" to talk about health care. He reminded people who question his qualifications as a comedian that they voted for a man who fired people on television for a living. The host then implored viewers to call their Senators and tell them \"not to gut American health care.\" Kimmel then provided the number to call Senators on screen. \"I'm not pretending to be an expert, I'm asking why people like you aren't listening to actual experts like the American Medical Association,\" Kimmel told Kennedy. \"I should not be the guy you go to for information on health care. And if these guys, like inbred John Kennedy, would tell the truth for a change, I wouldn't have to. I see these comments from these angry people, they say what qualifies you to talk about this stuff? You're a comedian, go back to being not funny. And I feel like it's my duty to remind these people, who are so concerned about my qualifications, the guy you voted for president?\" From Thursday's monologue:  JIMMY KIMMEL: So the president got involved last night via Twitter, of course. He wrote, 'I would not sign Graham-Cassidy if it did not include coverage of pre-existing conditions. It does! A great Bill. Repeal  ; Replace.' Those are the key words: repeal and replace. Because for Donald Trump this isn't about the Graham-Cassidy bill, it's about getting rid of Obamacare, which he hates, primarily because Obama's name is on it. He likes to have his name on things. Buildings, vodka, you name it. And at this point, he would sign anything if it meant getting rid of Obamacare. He'd sign copies of the Koran at the Barnes  ; Noble in Fallujah if it meant he could get rid of Obamacare. ","label":1}
{"text":"California Lt. Gov Gavin Newsome to NRA: \u201cWe ARE Coming for Your Guns\u201d: California\u2019s Lt. Gov Gavin Newsom decided to commemorate the tragic Sandy Hook shooting in 2012 by telling the NRA that if they hurt anybody else, they\u2019re coming for their guns. Not would be criminals\u2026but the NRA. \u201cIt\u2019s been 5 years since 20 first graders were shot dead at Sandy Hook,\u201d wrote Newsom on a Facebook post. Newsome then listed off the mass shootings that have occurred since that time.  Since then: \u2013 14 killed in San Bernardino \u2013 49 killed in Orlando\u2013 58 killed in Vegas\u2013 26 killed in a Texas churchEnough.  \u201cWe have a message for the NRA \u2013 National Rifle Association of America: If you hurt people, we ARE coming for your guns,\u201d wrote Newsome. The message was accompanied by a video featuring Newsome speaking on how the only thing more certain than another mass shooting is the \u201cmoral cowardice\u201d of Republicans who ignore it.  Trending Newsome then mocked the idea of thoughts and prayers, saying Republicans hide behind them while \u201cplugging their ears with NRA hush money.\u201d Turning to a solution, Newsome bragged that California has passed \u201cproposition 63\u201d and will force \u201cconvicted violent felons\u201d to give up their firearms. The video ends with Newsome saying voters need to tell Trump and Ryan to stop \u201cpraying for NRA dollars\u201d and fix the gun laws. This is accompanied by a group of people picking up both politicians and manhandling them back into the capitol to presumably pass gun control laws. I\u2019m not going to mince words here. This video and the accompanying message is flat out stupid. It paints innocents as criminals, and conveniently doesn\u2019t go into just what kind of law was passed with Prop 63. For one, the NRA didn\u2019t cause any of these mass shootings. None of the shooters that were involved were members of the NRA. Newsome\u2019s warning that he would take away the NRA\u2019s guns if they hurt anybody ever again is one of the most over-the-top and blatant lies ever leveled at the National Rifle Association. He also managed to leave out the fact that the Texas shooting was stopped by a former NRA instructor. Furthermore, Prop 63\u2019s purpose was to add to the already asinine restrictions on gun owners by making arms dealers obtain a permit to simply sell ammunition, and run a background check on people buying it. It also requires Californian\u2019s give up any magazine that can contain over 10 rounds. How that prevents criminals from hurting anyone is beyond me, seeing as how California has made obtaining a gun a difficult task, and yet criminals are still managing to get their hands on them. Once again, gun control politicians and advocates are punishing the law abiding for something the law defying did. Oh, and speaking of laws, CONVICTED VIOLENT CRIMINALS ARE ALREADY NOT ALLOWED TO OWN GUNS. This has been a federal law for decades, and yet the left seems to believe that criminals are walking into gun stores, and walking out with enough firepower to conquer a small nation. This ban for felons also already includes ammunition, making Prop 63 a useless gesture that trips up law abiding gun owners, and exposing it as Newsome\u2019s try-hard attempt to get some cred with the gun control crowd for when he runs for a higher office than his own. Newsome says in the video that the \u201ccoming for your guns\u201d bit was a warning to \u201ccriminals,\u201d but with the guy blaming the NRA and gun owners as the culprits in mass shootings, I\u2019d like to know what his definition of \u201ccriminal\u201d is. In one Facebook post, Newsome\u2026 -Exposed either his ignorance about our nation\u2019s gun laws or his willingness to lie about them. -Pegged an innocent gun rights organization and its members (millions on millions of people) for mass shootings they had nothing to do with -Mocked how people give condolences for tragic events that happen to them, specifically those of the religious variety -Accused Republicans of profiting off of the death of Americans with silence money given to them by the NRA -Stood on the graves of the slain to do it. Newsome\u2019s video is one of the more weasely things I\u2019ve seen in a while, and I write on Planned Parenthood\u2019s PR attempts a lot.","label":1}
{"text":"Roofing Contractor Leaves Job Half Done When He Finds Out What Evil Work Business Does!: You just have to admire a business that puts principles first above profit. In Wichita, Kansas that is exactly what happened. An abortion clinic there needed a new roof. They couldn\u2019t get any contractors to do the work because well\u2026 they\u2019re baby butchers. So, what do you do when you can\u2019t get a contractor to ignore that you do infanticide for a living? Why, you lie of course. They pretended to be a real estate firm and got a contractor to begin work. The roofing company got into the job, found out it was an abortion clinic and although they were out of pocket on materials and time, they packed up and walked off the job. Slow clap please. That\u2019s a contractor I would hire in a heartbeat and pay extra for it. The roof was only half complete when they left and they didn\u2019t look back once. No amount of money is worth helping a business that does evil work like that.  Farha Roofing found out about the true identity of the business thanks to Mark Gietzen and the Kansas Coalition For Life. The roofing company was reluctant to pull out because of the expense, but after enough complaints via phone calls, they packed it in and called it a loss. Inexplicably, they left foam insulation on pallets there as they left. The abortion business has had to go out of town and out of state to get help from plumbers and electricians. It may be a very long time before that roof gets finished. Good. Gietzen plans to send letters to all the surrounding businesses to warn them that the abortion mill lies in order to retain contractors.  It\u2019s pretty obvious that Wichita does not take kindly to abortion clinics. And if you have to lie to get people to help you, you are in the wrong business. Abortionists murder over 900,000 babies a year. It\u2019s genocide and it is deeply depraved and evil. Abortion is not simply another form of birth control. It is the knowing murder of another human being. They tear apart babies who are innocent souls and cannot protect themselves. Anyone who is against abortion should not have to take a job that helps them or promotes them, regardless of your religion. In my view, abortion is monstrous\u2026 it\u2019s not only immoral and unethical, it is literally sacrificing babies on a bloody altar for profit. I applaud this roofing company for doing the right thing here and walking away. That building doesn\u2019t need to be repaired\u2026 it should be demolished. ","label":1}

A couple of minutes later, CNN political analyst April Ryan used the presidential remark to ask Sanders if this means the White House has \u201cexhausted diplomacy.\u201d The spokesperson referred to North Korea and how the administration was using economic and diplomatic pressure on the reclusive country, leading Ryan to ask if Trump\u2019s comments were then referring to North Korea specifically. \u201cI\u2019m using that as an example,\u201d Sanders replied. \u201cWe have a lot of bad actors in the world, North Korea, Iran, several examples there.\u201d Watch the clip above, via CNN.

{"text":"Fox News guest says that the only problem with missing 1,500 immigrant children is that America can't deport them:  GRIFF JENKINS (CO-HOST): What is this about the government lost 1500 migrant children? MARK KRIKORIAN (EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES): What it means is that when these unaccompanied minors -- this is people who came over, that were smuggled here by their parents but they came supposedly on their own, they were handed over to the Department of Health and Human Services, which takes care of this, and then they were placed with their illegal immigrant relatives in the United States at tax payer expense. What this number represents is that 30 days afterwards the social workers at Health and Human Services try to call up on the phone and say, you know, \"How are things going?\" And this number of people, 1400-something of them, they couldn't get in touch with. They didn't return the phone calls or they lied about what their phone numbers are, or they moved, something like that. And this is exactly the same thing that happened under Obama. We released a report on this a year and a half ago and there was nothing, no, crickets, because the problem here is not that some 4-year-old is wandering the streets in the middle of the night. Nothing like that is happening. The problem here is that the government has no idea where they are, therefore they're never going to show up for their hearings and they're here illegally, permanently. Under Obama that was a good thing, so it never got any news coverage. Now they're saying, \"Oh my God, Trump lost kids.\" Now it's news. JENKINS: It's interesting, Mark. So, is it your sense then that this has become political? It appears, if you look at Twitter and media outlets and really some stars, Alyssa Milano and some others tweeting that this is unbelievable, that this has now happened. Comparing it in some cases as if it were the terrible story of the Boko Haram girls, being kidnapped for the purposes of being terrorist's wives. Is this is same thing or is this just a politicization of the story? KRIKORIAN: Yeah, this is a classic propaganda operation. I think it probably sort of happened by accident. Nobody planned it. But this is the way that propaganda works. You take a fact that's real, a kernel of truth, and then you twist it and manipulate it in such a way that's going to resonate with the target population you're trying to manipulate. This is, there's no question there are actually a handful of people probably, who were, of these young people, who were put in some kind of bad situation. That's entirely possible. But the bulk of this problem is that these illegal immigrants are on the run and the relatives that they were placed with don't want to talk with the government. That's why we can't get in touch with them. JENKINS: Right, Mark, very quickly because we're almost out of time. For the practical viewers, are these kids missing? KRIKORIAN: No, they are not missing. They are missing as far as the immigration system is concerned. And the point of that is they basically, we're never going to find them to return them to their own countries. That's the problem, it's not that they're on a milk carton somewhere.

{"text":"Trump lays out immigration deal demands: US President Donald Trump has said that there will be no deal to protect hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants from deportation without funding to build a wall along the US-Mexico border Donald Trump US President Donald Trump has said that there will be no deal to protect hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants from deportation without funding to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, the media reported. \"The Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed wall at the Southern Border and an end to the horrible Chain Migration and ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc,\" Trump tweeted on Friday. \"We must protect our Country at all cost!\" Trump's declaration casts doubt over how Democrats and Republicans will come together to protect the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) participants, of which there are nearly 800,000 who were brought to the United States illegal as children, from deportation because it is unlikely that Democrats will agree to substantial funding for Trump's border wall in exchange for DACA protections, CNN reported. Drew Hammill, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's spokesman, responded to Trump's tweet late Friday by stating that Democrats were \"not going to negotiate through the press and look forward to a serious negotiation at Wednesday's (January 3) meeting when we come back\". Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly will meet on January 3. The top discussion topic will be renewed government spending talks. Trump's tweet is his clearest statement to date on his negotiating position with Democrats to achieve a deal on DACA, programmme launched by former President Barack Obama that Trump ended in September. Trump has demanded that funding for the border wall would need to be part of any deal, but it remains unclear how far he would be willing to go to protect DACA recipients. Earlier this year, the President had said that his administration was not looking at \"citizenship\" or \"amnesty\" but that they are \"looking at allowing people to stay here\".

{"text":"If Democrats Win Big in November: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer at a Capitol Hill news conference, March 22, 2018. Pelosi and Schumer could cripple Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda, stymie Supreme Court picks, and focus on impeachment. \u2018I certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out. That would be very bad for the Republican Party \u2014 and please let Cryin\u2019 Chuck stay!\u201d So tweeted a bullish President Trump last summer after Democrats lost a congressional special election in Georgia they had hoped to win. He got his wish: Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are still in charge of their party on Capitol Hill. Now these two political veterans are leading the drive for a Democratic takeover of Congress this fall. What if they succeed? What if they manage to switch out the \u201cMinority\u201d in their titles to \u201cMajority\u201d? What can America expect? In a word: obstructionism \u2014 on an unprecedented scale. A few months ago, conservatives were calling Pelosi and Schumer \u201cdo-nothing Democrats\u201d for refusing to sit down with the president to negotiate a budget to keep the government open. That was just a warm-up act for the obstructionism to come if they get control of one or both houses of Congress. Here are five things we can expect if the Dems win big in the midterm elections. 1) We will get no new conservative or constitutionalist judges. Should a Supreme Court vacancy arise in the next two years, Democrats will make sure it has zero chance of being filled. They will see it as payback for the Senate Republican blockade of President Obama\u2019s nominee to fill the vacancy left by Justice Scalia\u2019s death. But they won\u2019t stop there. Democrats will also refuse to confirm any lower-court nominees they don\u2019t care for \u2014 and that will be most of them. The Trump administration, working closely with Senate Republicans, has been remaking the federal courts, shifting away from judicial activism and toward an emphasis on the rule of law. If Democrats succeed this November, that process will grind to a halt. 2) No substantive legislation will be approved. Despite being briefly courted by President Trump, Schumer and Pelosi have shown little interest in \u201cdoing deals\u201d with him. If they get control of either House of Congress, they will probably put off major legislative priorities until 2021 \u2014 when they hope one of their own will occupy the White House. And if they make any exceptions to cutting deals with Trump, the bills they put on his desk will not be to the liking of conservatives. 3) House and Senate committees will be militantly focused on investigations and oversight. If Democrats get their hands on the gavels of congressional committees, they will spend little time on productive legislating \u2014 why give President Trump any bipartisan accomplishments? Instead, they will devote their power and resources to methodically investigating the president, his staff, and his agency appointees.  Entrenched bureaucrats (some of them Obama appointees who burrowed into career positions) will effectively be put in control. The president\u2019s own appointees in each agency will be undermined from within.  This will result in near-paralysis for the administration. Rather than working on the president\u2019s agenda, the already-thin political leadership in the federal agencies will find itself under siege from Capitol Hill. Agency leaders will be constantly on defense, parrying committee document requests, subpoenas, and congressionally instigated inspector-general investigations. Executive-branch efforts to advance a right-of-center agenda will feel like trying to organize a softball league at Verdun. 4) Executive-branch confirmations will slow to a trickle. Senate Democrats have already perfected the art of using every procedural trick in the book to slow the confirmation process and keep the federal government understaffed. If Democrats pick up a majority of Senate seats, expect them to double down on this strategy. If they allow an occasional nominee to get through, they will extract steep policy concessions and other tradeoffs in return. The result? Entrenched bureaucrats (some of them Obama appointees who burrowed into career positions) will effectively be put in control. The president\u2019s own appointees in each agency will be undermined from within as they try to implement his policies. 5) Democrats will use legislation to block Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda. One of President Trump\u2019s signature accomplishments has been a robust program of deregulation aimed at promoting economic growth. Most of that has been implemented by executive action, but Democrats would have the power to stymie the president\u2019s deregulatory agenda if they seized control of one or both Houses of Congress. Their most effective weapon would be riders to appropriations bills that would deny the funding needed to carry out new Trump-era rules \u2014 rules that most Democrats in Congress don\u2019t like. President Trump could certainly veto such bills. However, he would eventually be forced into a government-shutdown scenario. Trump may judge that worth the risk, but Democrats could keep his deregulatory priorities in limbo for the duration. If Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer get a fresh taste of power after the midterms, they won\u2019t be thinking about the dangers of overreaching. But those dangers are real. Donald Trump pulled off an astonishing victory in 2016 because voters were tired of business as usual in Washington and wanted real change. The Democrats will be bullied by their far-left base to shut down President Trump\u2019s audacious agenda and even attempt to impeach him. If they do, not only could their midterm gains be short-lived, but they may even help boost the reelection of a president they loathe.

{"text":"We got a glimpse of Trump negotiating. It didn\u2019t go well.: President Donald Trump during a meeting with bipartisan members of Congress on immigration on Tuesday, Jan. 9, 2018. Photo Credit: Bloomberg \/ Andrew Harrer White House officials made the unusual decision Tuesday to allow cameras to film a nearly hourlong immigration meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers. They probably wish they hadn\u2019t. For a moment, Democrats thought they had struck an unexpected deal with President Donald Trump. Trump had previously insisted that any deal protecting \u201cdreamers\u201d - undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children - should also include border security and\/or a border wall. But he now says that he would support a \u201cclean\u201d bill protecting dreamers, and then take up comprehensive immigration reform later. \u201cWhat about a clean DACA bill now and a commitment to do comprehensive next?\u201d said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. Trump responded: \u201cYeah, I would like to do that. I think a lot of people would like to see that.\u201d The problem? Trump didn\u2019t know what \u201cclean DACA bill\u201d meant. Republicans quickly interjected and made clear that Trump believes a \u201cclean\u201d bill would include border security. Except that\u2019s not at all what a clean bill is; that\u2019s a compromise bill. A clean bill only has one component to it and doesn\u2019t include multiple elements, which could muddy it. By the end, Trump sought to clarify things. \u201cI think a clean DACA bill, to me, is a DACA bill, but we take care of the 800,000 people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think, to me, a clean bill is a bill of DACA - we take care of them, and we also take care of security.\u201d If anything, the whole mess showed pretty vividly just how utterly disengaged Trump is in the finer details of policy discussions. Which is exactly the perception that he has recently fought against. Asked by The New York Times late last month about this perception, Trump bristled. \u201cI know the details of taxes better than anybody - better than the greatest CPA,\u201d he said. \u201cI know the details of health care better than most, better than most.\u201d Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy. The problem is that every public indication gives us the opposite impression. Trump almost continually moves the goal posts on what he wants, shifts the terms of the debate and misstates what\u2019s actually contained in the legislation that is before Congress. Even by the end of the meeting, Trump seemed to indicate that the border wall isn\u2019t necessarily a must-have for him - becoming just the latest iteration in a dizzying series of back-and-forths on what he wants in a DACA deal. \u201cMy position will be what the people in this room come up with,\u201d Trump said. He added later: \u201cI\u2019m not going to say, \u2018Oh, gee, I want this,\u2019 or \u2018I want that.\u2019 I will be signing it.\u201d OK, so you\u2019re no longer demanding the border wall or even border security, then? If you are a Democrat hearing those words, it\u2019s pretty clear Trump isn\u2019t wedded to his position on, well, anything. The border wall seems more like an opening bid. If Trump has shown us anything, it\u2019s that he just wants to sign bills and make sure the base doesn\u2019t hate him for it. So as long as he can plausibly say he fought the good fight for the border wall - even if he didn\u2019t - it seems he\u2019s ready to just get it over with and claim a legislative win. Which is generally OK. Presidents needn\u2019t dirty their hands with all of the sausage-making that happens on Pennsylvania Avenue. Congress produces the bills, and the president decides whether to sign them. But Trump has repeatedly assured us that he knows this stuff better than almost anyone and that he\u2019s the world\u2019s pre-eminent negotiator. What we saw Tuesday was neither of those things.

{"text":"Science Shows That Discriminating Against Religious Groups Feeds Radicalisation: Marginalising and discriminating against immigrants displaced from their traditional countries and cultures is a significant contributor to feelings of radicalisation, according to a new study. Two surveys involving approximately 400 Muslim immigrants living in the US and Germany show that prejudicial attitudes towards people trying to integrate into new cultures can end up making them more susceptible to extremist causes. \"We found that immigrants who identify with neither their heritage culture nor the culture they are living in feel marginalised and insignificant,\" says social psychologist Sarah Lyons-Padilla from Stanford University. \"Experiences of discrimination make the situation worse.\" Lyons-Padilla's team conducted an online survey of 198 Muslim immigrants living in the US, asking them how connected they felt to their heritage and to American values \u2013 and how well they thought they had integrated into their new home. In addition, the participants were given a hypothetical situation to consider, involving an imaginary fundamentalist group consisting of young Muslims, who existed to stand up against American maltreatment of Muslims. While this made-up group was never explicitly said to condone or perpetuate violence, the participants were given the impression that the activists supported extreme actions where necessary. The survey respondents were asked to what extent they could imagine their friends and social circle sympathising with the aims and values of this hypothetical group, and whether they'd be likely to conduct illegal or violent actions to help further its agenda. The responses to the survey indicated that, overall, support for extremism was very low. This supported wider research that shows a majority of Muslims simply do not hold radical views. However, within a small minority, the survey showed that a feeling of marginalisation and discrimination could predict feelings of insignificance \u2013 which in turn increased people's attraction to fundamentalist groups and their extreme behaviour. According to Lyons-Padilla, the findings back up the work of researcher Arie Kruglanksi from Maryland University, who has previously explored the psychological motivations of terrorists. \"Kruglanski [proposed] a particularly compelling theory: people become terrorists to restore a sense of significance in their lives, a feeling that they matter,\" Lyons-Padilla explained for The Guardian in an opinion piece last year. \"Extremist organisations like Isis are experts at giving their recruits that sense of purpose, through status, recognition, and the promise of eternal rewards in the afterlife.\" To help counter the threat of extremist organisations, Lyons-Padilla argues that we need to diminish their appeal in the eyes of marginalised immigrants \u2013 and the first step in doing so is by not making them feel unwelcome and unappreciated in their adopted homelands. In contrast, things like anti-Islam rhetoric, bans on Muslims travelling, and increased policing and monitoring of Muslim communities won't actually curb extremism \u2013 they'll just help enable it. \"According to my research, this is the recipe for making American Muslims feel disenfranchised and discriminated against,\" Lyons-Padilla writes. \"We are actually planting the seeds for radicalisation and essentially helping Isis recruit by fuelling the narrative that the west is anti-Islam.\" In a separate, complementary survey that looked at the experience of 204 German Muslim immigrants \u2013 in addition to the US cohort \u2013 the researchers found that those living in the US were having an easier time integrating into US culture than their counterparts in Germany. The team attributes this to the US having a comparatively \"looser\" culture than Germany's more conformity-based society, which the researchers think could also influence people's susceptibility to radicalisation. The preliminary findings of that study are still undergoing peer review, but Lyons-Padilla thinks it shows more evidence that openness to diversity is needed to stop disenfranchised immigrants from becoming \"culturally homeless\". In the researchers' view, it's not just about Islamophobia being hurtful and morally wrong. By being accepting and promoting inclusivity wherever we can, we're likely to be sowing the foundations for a more secure society \u2013 not just a fairer, better one. \"We can make it harder for terrorists to recruit by making the culturally homeless feel more at home,\" Lyons-Padilla explains. The findings were presented at the American Psychological Association's 125th Annual Convention in Washington last week. ","label":0}

Well, folks on Twitter were quick to point out the problems with Trump's latest themed week - a lot of the products made by both his and daughter Ivanka's companies are not, in fact, made in the U.S. A recent investigation by The Washington Postfound that the Ivanka Trump brand's products were regularly manufactured in countries like Bangladesh, China, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia, where labor isn't as protected. Ivanka's brand has also been accused of failing to monitor its suppliers, who are supposed to protect workers from abuse and child labor. The president's company has sold products manufactured abroad as well. According to Mashable, his line of ties have been made in Mexico, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and China for years. Given this information, Twitter users couldn't stop themselves from pointing out the hypocrisy of the Trump family celebrating a Made In America Week.","label":1}

{"text":"Colin Kaepernick files a grievance lawsuit against NFL owners: Colin Kaepernick Kaepernick last year started the concept of taking a knee during the national anthem before games as a protest against perceived racial inequality. Despite being a starter for the San Francisco 49ers, the 29-year-old has not been recruited by an NFL team since becoming a free agent in March and blames his political views for being ignored. \"We can confirm that this morning we filed a grievance under the CBA on behalf of Colin Kaepernick,\" Geragos said in a statement released on Twitter. \"This was done only after pursuing every possible avenue with all NFL teams and their executives. \"If the NFL (as well as all professional sports leagues) is to remain a meritocracy, then principled and peaceful political protest - which the owners themselves made great theatre imitating weeks ago - should not be punished and athletes should not be denied employment. \"Such a precedent threatens all patriotic Americans and harkens back to our darkest days as a nation. Protecting all athletes from such collusive conduct is what compelled Mr Kaepernick to file his grievance. \"Colin Kaepernick's goal has always been, and remains, to simply be treated fairly by the league he performed at the highest level for and to return to the football playing field.\" Kaepernick's act of taking a knee has been emulated by other NFL players, resulting in US president Donald Trump last month calling for the protesters to be fired by their teams, calling them \"sons of b******\". Trump also posted a series of tweets in which he insisted \"the issue of kneeling has nothing do with race\". Six days ago NFL commissioner Roger Goodell sent a memo to all team owners in which he said \"everyone should stand for the National Anthem\". \"The current dispute over the National Anthem is threatening to erode the unifying power of our game, and is now dividing us, and our players, from many fans across the country,\" Goodell said. The memo came after US vice president Mike Pence walked out of the Indianapolis Colts' game against the San Francisco 49ers after a large number of 49ers players took a knee during the anthem.","label":0}

{"text":"Rose McGowan's Temporary Twitter Lock-Out Inspires #WomenBoycottTwitter Movement: Rose McGowan was one of the women who shared her story in The New York Times's initial report last week about the decades of sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein. Since then, the actress has stayed vocal on Twitter, sharing her support for the other women who have accused Weinstein and other powerful men of sexual harassment and assault. Early Thursday morning, however, Twitter partially suspended her account, infuriating McGowan and other supporters of victims of sexual violence. This happened after Rose had tweeted several times this week about Weinstein and about Ben Affleck. McGowan shared the news of her suspension on Instagram early Thursday morning, posting a screenshot of the message she had received from Twitter alerting her to the suspension and asking her to \"delete Tweets that violate our rules.\" \"TWITTER HAS SUSPENDED ME. THERE ARE POWERFUL FORCES AT WORK. BE MY VOICE. #ROSEARMY #whywomendontreport,\" she captioned the photo. Countless people took to Twitter to express their outrage over what some thought to be an attempt by the social media platform to silence women speaking out against alleged abuse, while allowing powerful men's spewing of hate and violence to go unchecked. As one user summed it up, \"Jemele Hill gets suspended. Rose McGowan gets suspended. Trump spews hate daily and nada. Notice a pattern here? Silencing women!\" Other Twitter users have since devised a plan to boycott Twitter on Friday, October 13, in support of women like McGowan who have been silenced for sharing their experiences. The \"WomenBoycottTwitter\" hashtag was trending on Thursday, with one user pointing out, \"Looks like we've got the day off tomorrow, feminists.\" For its part, Twitter released a statement on Thursday explaining its decision to temporarily suspend Rose's account. \"We have been in touch with Ms. McGowan's team. We want to explain that her account was temporarily locked because one of her Tweets included a private phone number, which violates our Terms of Service. The Tweet was removed and her account has been unlocked. We will be clearer about these policies and decisions in the future,\" the tweeted statement read. \"Twitter is proud to empower and support the voices on our platform, especially those that speak truth to power. We stand with the brave women and men who use Twitter to share their stories, and will work hard every day to improve our processes to protect those voices.\" Teen Vogue has reached out to Twitter for further comment; this post will be updated with their response.","label":0}
{"text":"How ISIS Got Its Flag: An Iraqi Shiite militiaman prays next to a wall painted with the black flag used by ISIS. On an August morning in 2014, someone noticed a black flag hanging outside a rundown duplex in suburban New Jersey. He could not make out its Arabic, but he recognized the design from horrific news reports about ISIS, in which masked jihadists fought under the banner to realize their dark vision of God\u2019s rule on earth. Alarmed, the passerby sent a picture of the house and its flag to a friend, who promptly tweeted it and informed the Department of Homeland Security. The flag\u2019s owner, Mark Dunaway, had converted to Islam a decade prior, he explained to the police when they arrived, and he flew the flag to mark Muslim holidays. \u201cEvery Muslim uses that black flag,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find it in any mosque in the world.\u201d Still, he took it down. \u201cI understand now that people turn on CNN and see the flag associated with jihad, but that\u2019s not the intention \u2026 at all. It says, \u2018There is only one god, Allah, and the prophet Mohammed is his messenger.\u2019 It\u2019s not meant to be a symbol of hate.\u201d Dunaway, like many Muslims and even Middle East experts, did not know that the flag had been designed by ISIS in 2006. He and others were confused because the Islamic State had used terror and Twitter to advertise its brand, and Islamic tradition to obscure its meaning. Before the group declared itself the caliphate reborn that summer, it had been ambiguous about the flag\u2019s meaning and the cause it represented. Was it the flag of an Islamic state, or the flag of the Islamic state\u2014the caliphate that had once ruled land from Spain to Iran and whose prophesied return would herald the end of the world? The Islamic State encouraged the second interpretation but let the global community of jihadists read into the flag and the \u201cstate\u201d what they would. The group\u2019s cause proved so compelling among jihadists that in 2014 the organization supplanted its former master, al-Qaeda. The spread of the flag, then, traces the spread of an idea and chronicles a major changing of the guard in the global jihadist movement. ISIS Flag (Wikimedia) When the Islamic State first announced itself on October 15, 2006, it had no flag of its own. It was not until January 2007 that al-Qaeda\u2019s media distribution arm, al-Fajr, released a picture of the Islamic State\u2019s new flag. Anonymous authors affiliated with the Islamic State explained its design, quoting passages from Islamic scripture and historical accounts. \u201cThe flag of the prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, is a black square made of striped wool,\u201d according to one account. Another describes Mohammed \u201cstanding on the pulpit preaching\u201d surrounded by fluttering black flags. \u201cOn the flag of the prophet was written, \u2018No god but God, and Mohammed is the Messenger of God.\u2019\u201d The flag even had a name: \u201cthe eagle.\u201d Although the authors acknowledged other reports of green, white, and yellow flags, they concluded the Islamic State\u2019s flag would be black, because most of the reports about Mohammed mentioned a black flag. The authors were equally confident when explaining the banner\u2019s text. \u201cWhat is written on the flag is what is written on the flag of the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him.\u201d The Islamic State\u2019s design of the Muslim profession of faith is different from every other attempt to replicate the prophet\u2019s flag: \u201cNo god but God\u201d is scrawled in white across the top and \u201cMohammed is the Messenger of God\u201d is stacked in black inside a white circle. As the anonymous authors noted, they took the circle\u2019s design from a seal of the prophet used on a set of letters, now housed in Turkey\u2019s Topkapi Palace, that were supposedly written on Mohammed\u2019s behalf. (Modern scholars doubt the letters\u2019 authenticity.) We are meant to believe the Islamic State had inherited the prophet\u2019s seal, just as the early caliphs had. Why make a flag? In addition to following the prophet\u2019s example, the Islamic State wanted a symbol to rally people to its cause. The group quoted a 19th-century Ottoman historian and official, Ahmad Cevdet Pasha, to make the point:  The secret in creating a flag is that it gathers people under a single banner to unify them, meaning that this flag is a sign of the coming together of their words and a proof of the unity of their hearts. They are like a single body and what knits them together is stronger than the bond of blood relatives.  Yet the Islamic State\u2019s choices display the modern sensibilities they try so hard to displace. The white scrawl across the top, \u201cNo god but God,\u201d is deliberately ragged, meant to suggest an era before the precision of Photoshop, even though the flag was designed on a computer. Even the Islamic State\u2019s quotation of Ahmad Cevdet Pasha unwittingly betrays a modern perspective. Influenced by European notions of nationalism yet desiring to hold together the multiethnic Ottoman Empire under sovereign Turkish rule, Cevdet Pasha imagined Islam and its symbols to be the glue. \u201cThe only thing uniting Arab, Kurd, Albanian, and Bosnian is the unity of Islam,\u201d he said, according to Dominic Lieven\u2019s book Empire: The Russian Empire and its Rivals. \u201cYet the real strength of the Sublime State lies with the Turks.\u201d The Islamic State ended the explanation of its flag\u2019s design with a prayer: \u201cWe ask God, praised be He, to make this flag the sole flag for all Muslims. We are certain that it will be the flag of the people of Iraq when they go to aid \u2026 the Mahdi at the holy house of God.\u201d The house of God is the Kaaba in Mecca, the holiest shrine in Islam, and the Mahdi is the savior who Muslims believe will appear there in the years leading up to the apocalypse. The Islamic State was signaling that its flag was not only the symbol of its government and the herald of a future caliphate; it was the harbinger of the final battle at the End of Days. Legends of the black flag and the Muslim savior, the Mahdi, first circulated during the reign of the Umayyad dynasty, which ruled the Islamic empire from Damascus in the seventh and eighth centuries C.E. The dynasty\u2019s founders, the Umayya clan, had seized the caliphate from Mohammed\u2019s son-in-law and grandsons, which infuriated many Muslims. People unhappy with Umayyad rule circulated prophecies of a man of the prophet\u2019s family who would return justice to the world. They called the man the Mahdi, Arabic for \u201cthe Rightly Guided One.\u201d Many of the prophecies envision the Mahdi appearing during the End of Days to lead the final battles against the infidels. Like most Islamic prophecies of the End of Days, those about the Mahdi are not found in the preeminent scripture of Islam, the Koran, which Muslims believe preserves God\u2019s revelation to Mohammed, but rather in the voluminous compendia of the words and deeds of the prophet and his companions, known as hadith, which were written down decades or even centuries after the prophet\u2019s death. Muslims argue over the veracity of individual hadith, and the contradictions between them, the way some Christians debate the reliability of the Gospels and their discrepancies. End-Time prophecies were an especially inviting target for fabricators. In the internecine wars that tore apart the early Muslim community, each side sought to justify its politics by predicting its inevitable victory and the other side\u2019s preordained defeat. Prophecies proliferated, reaching into the thousands. When the politics evaporated, the prophetic residue remained. Supporters of the prophet\u2019s family loosely aligned themselves as part of what historians call the Hashemite movement, which believed the Mahdi would be a descendent of Mohammed\u2019s great-grandfather, Hashem. Many of the movement\u2019s supporters were from Iran, where Zoroastrian legends prophesied the coming of a club-wielding savior who would appear at the End of Time followed by sable-clad disciples. Influenced by the prophecies, the revolutionaries donned black clothes, flew black flags, and carried around wooden clubs called \u201cinfidel-bashers.\u201d As the revolutionaries built support for their cause, they circulated prophecies of soldiers fighting under black flags who would come from the East to overthrow the Umayyads. Some were put in the mouth of Mohammed\u2019s son-in-law, Ali, who allegedly foretold the coming of an army from Khorasan, the \u201cland of the rising sun\u201d that includes parts of eastern Iran and most of Afghanistan. Other black-flag prophecies were attributed to the prophet himself. \u201cIf you see the black banners coming from Khorasan,\u201d instructs one, \u201cgo to them immediately even if you must crawl over ice because indeed among them is the caliph, al-Mahdi.\u201d In early Islam, the color black was associated not just with mourning but also with revenge for a wrongful death. According to the historian Ibn Khaldun, the opponents of the Umayyads adopted black as their color to avenge the Umayyads\u2019 persecution of the prophet\u2019s family. Black flags were also flown by the prophet in his war with the infidels. \u201cDo not flee with [the flag] from the infidels and do not fight with it against the Muslims,\u201d Mohammed reportedly told one of his generals. Apocalyptic messages resonate among many Muslims today because of the political turmoil in the Middle East. In 2012, half of all Muslims in North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia expected the imminent appearance of the Mahdi. And why wouldn\u2019t they, given the revolutions sweeping the Arab world? The signs that herald his coming have only multiplied since. A great sectarian war tears Syria asunder. Iraq is in chaos. The \u201cinfidel\u201d West has invaded. The \u201ctribulations\u201d are too awful and apparent to brook mundane explanations.

{"text":"Donald Trump Goes Full Fredo: Paramount Pictures \/ IMDB \u201cI can handle things. I\u2019m smart! Not like everybody says, like dumb. I\u2019m smart and I want respect!\u201d This morning\u2019s presidential Twitter outburst recalls those words of Fredo Corleone\u2019s in one of the most famous scenes from The Godfather series. Trump tweeted that his \u201ctwo greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart,\u201d and in a subsequent tweet called himself a \u201cvery stable genius.\u201d Trump may imagine that he\u2019s Michael Corleone, the tough and canny rightful heir\u2014or even Sonny Corleone, the terrifyingly violent but at least powerful heir apparent\u2014but after today he is Fredo forever. There\u2019s a key difference between film and reality, though: The Corleone family had the awareness and vigilance to exclude Fredo from power. The American political system did not do so well. Michael Wolff\u2019s scathing new book about the Trump White House has sent President Trump spiraling into the most publicly visible meltdown of his presidency. Until now, Trump\u2019s worst moments have occurred behind closed doors, and have become known to the public only second-hand, leaked by worried officials, aides, and advisers. Yesterday and today, we have seen a Trump temper tantrum in real time on Twitter, extended over hours, punctuated only by stretch of fitful presidential sleep. Trump\u2019s tweets yesterday focused largely on the blockbuster Wolff book, Fire and Fury. It may not be the newsiest\u2014arguably it is the least newsy\u2014but the most important moment in Wolff\u2019s book are words attributed at second or third-hand to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the time of Donald Trump\u2019s election. \u201cHe will sign anything we put in front of him.\u201d Who and what Donald Trump is has been known to everyone and anyone who cared to know for years and decades. Before he was president, he was the country\u2019s leading racist conspiracy theorist. Before he was the country\u2019s leading racist conspiracy theorist, he was a celebrity gameshow host. Before he was a celebrity gameshow host, he was the multi-bankrupt least trusted name in real estate. Before he was the multi-bankrupt least trusted name in real estate, he was the protege of Roy Cohn\u2019s repeatedly accused of ties to organized crime. From the start, Donald Trump was a man of many secrets, but no mysteries. Inscribed indelibly on the public record were the reasons for responsible people to do everything in their power to bar him from the presidency. Instead, since he announced his candidacy in mid-2015, Donald Trump has been enabled and protected. The enabling and protecting not only continues. It accelerates. Before the Saturday morning tweets, what should have been the biggest story of the week was Trump\u2019s success at mobilizing the Senate and the FBI to deploy criminal prosecution as a weapon against Trump critics. The Senate Judiciary committee\u2014the Senate Judiciary Committee! The committee that oversees the proper enforcement of the law!\u2014formally filed a criminal referral with the Department of Justice against Christopher Steele, the author of the infamous dossier about Trump\u2019s Russia connections. The referral was signed by the committee\u2019s chairman, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, without even notice to Democrats on the committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said; a startling abuse of majority status and a sharp departure from the norms of the Senate, especially a 51-49 Senate. The Department of Justice can ignore such a referral. It\u2019s ominous, however, that on the very same day, the FBI obeyed Trump\u2019s repeated demands and reopened a long-closed criminal investigation into the Clinton Foundation. The FBI has come under relentless abuse from Trump, who complains about its refusal to do his will. Is it now yielding? We also learned this week from The New York Times that aides to the attorney general sought damaging information on Capitol Hill about FBI Director Comey, indicating close cooperation between the White House and Main Justice to exert political control over the country\u2019s chief law-enforcement agency. Michael Wolff has drawn the most indelible picture yet of Donald Trump, the man. But the important thing about Trump is not the man; it\u2019s the system of power surrounding the man. In 2016, there were voters who genuinely, in good faith, believed that Donald Trump was a capable business leader, moderate on social issues, who cared about the troubles of working class white America\u2014and would do something to help. There may well still be some people who believe this\u2014but nowhere near enough to sustain a presidency. What sustains Trump now is the support of people who know what he is, but back him anyway. Republican political elites who know him for what he is, but who back him because they believe they can control and use him; conservative-media elites who sense what he is, but who delight in the culture wars he provokes; rank-and-file conservatives who care more about their grievances and hatreds than the governance of the country. After the Trump pardon of Sheriff Arpaio for obstruction of justice, a popular conservative blogger tweeted this justification of the president\u2019s shocking attack on the rule of law: \u201cThe main reason for President Trump to pardon Sheriff Joe was fuck you, leftists. The new rules, bitches. &#128526; \u201d However crazy Trump may be, in one way he is indeed the \u201cvery stable genius\u201d he claims to be: Trump understands how to mobilize hatred and resentment to his own advantage and profit. He has risen higher than Joe McCarthy or Charles Lindbergh or Theodore Bilbo\u2014and he has lasted already nearly a full year in office, holding the approval of one-third of the country, more than sufficient to keep him there for a full term. Michael Wolff has done a crucial service, showing more intimately than any reporter yet the true nature of the man at the center of the American system. But without the complicity of other power-holders, Trump would drop from his central position like a tooth from a rotten gum. What we need to do now is widen the camera angle beyond Fredo Trump to the hard-faced men and women over his shoulders. Those are the people who put Trump where he is, and keep him there, corrupting the institutions of American democracy and troubling the peace and security of the world.

I voted for that party, I associate with that party, and I have agreed with (most of) the office\u2019s decisions that came after Trump\u2019s inauguration - I still do.

And those are (some of) the people that I used to relate myself with. However, in this moment in time, I would give anything to not belong to that group - just for the sake of the reputation that they\u2019re foolishly giving themselves - and the people that call themselves conservatives but don\u2019t act out like this. If this party didn\u2019t already lose enough respect, they certainly lost it all now. In most of the world, the republican party has already been anything but respected. But now, it\u2019s like they dug a hole for themselves and, as conservatives, are shoveling the dirt right on top of them. Thanks to this hideous outrage coming from white supremacists, the conservative name is being dragged through the mud. Because of that, it will take a very long time to gain the respect of the people identifying with that party - even if they\u2019re nothing like the people torching, chanting, and hating. And, because of that, people like me (and other people who belong to this party) are included in the thought that we must think that hatred, too. It's sad to realize that prejudice is still alive and well. In fact, it's more active now than it has been in a long time. Unfortunately, for some people, it took a dangerous and destructive for some people to recognize that. I am appalled at the actions being taken because of a difference of opinions.

Then he declared that he knows what it\u2019s like to be black because he\u2019s an American.   \u201cThe oppression that African-Americans and other races are getting in America, it\u2019s bad,\u201d Mitchell responded. \u201cAnd I think America can be, it can be great again if you stop the racial profiling, if you stop a lot of things that\u2019s happening in America. We can both stand now.\u201d Carlson responded: \u201cIt just seems like an overstatement. I understand people are upset about specific cases where people are killed by the police.\u201d \u201cBut Tucker you could never understand, you could never understand, you don\u2019t live it,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWell, actually I can understand cause I am an American, OK, whatever,\u201d Carlson claimed. Mitchell attempted to interject, but Carlson spoke over him, bristling at the notion that he wasn\u2019t able to understand the oppression of black Americans. \u201cHey, slow down,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cI\u2019m an American and I have, don\u2019t pull that crap on me.\u201d  Oh dear.

{"text":"Cassandra Fairbanks Believes In \u201cThe First Amendment, Boobs, and Wikileaks\u201d; WikiLeaks Agrees: Content originally published at iBankCoin.com Following two weeks of excitement involving WikiLeaks, journalist Cassandra Fairbanks took to Twitter to implore President Trump to issue a preemptive pardon to founder Julian Assange - whose Twitter account was mysteriously deactivated for several hours on Christmas, several days after a WikiLeaks attorney's office was broken into. Sporting an \"I'm with WikiLeaks\" top like the one she wore to a January Senate hearing on hacking, Fairbanks begins her plea which was Retweeted by both official WikiLeaks accounts, by reminding people that the US has never filed any formal charges against Julian Assange:  \"I think that we should be pressuring Donald Trump to do more to help Julian Assange. It's probably one of the most important things that he get out of that Embassy. The United States has never filed any formal charges against Assange.\" Trump has the ability to grant a preemptive pardon, which means that he would never have to face trial or be extradited here at all.\" -Cassandra Fairbanks  Fairbanks then points out that the media thrives on leaked information, which is often false, and sometimes results in \"disastrous consequences, sometimes even deadly - like the case in the Iraq War,\" adding \"unlike the fake news published by outlets like the NYT to sell war to the public, Assange has published true, real information that has influenced the public to want to get out of wars.\" She then notes that Assange was \"once held in the absolute highest regard by the left for the publishing of the Iraq and Afghan war logs,\" crippling the agenda of the \"war-hungry swamp\" and dealing a massive blow to the Bush administration.  We elected Trump because of his rejection of the war-monger establishment, and the fake news media. With what he represents, Trump should be giving Assange a medal and throwing him a parade instead of allowing his political persecution to continue. Assange is the bravest and most heroic man on the planet, and every day he is without freedom is a tragedy. If Trump really wanted to stick it to the deep state, this would be how to do it.  \"Wikileaks doesn't hack or steal documents - they simply publish things they obtain or are given to them. You know, like what Buzzfeed did when they published that debunked bullsh*t f*cking potty-dossier from John McCain,\" said Fairbanks. Watch below:  The only three things I believe in are the First Amendment, boobs, and WikiLeaks pic.twitter.com\/lPGrWaXDFh \u2014 Cassandra Fairbanks (@CassandraRules) December 27, 2017  Reported last week, Three hooded figures dressed in black broke into the Madrid office of WikiLeaks lawyer Baltasar Garzon at dawn on Monday morning, in what police are describing as a \"very professional\" operation they are treating as an attempted robbery, according to Spain's largest newspaper, El Pa\u00eds. Garzon heads Assange's legal defense, in particular working to avoid extradition to Sweden and preparing to face charges thought to be pending by U.S. authorities. The intruders covered security cameras with tape, and there were no signs that anything was taken - however police are analyzing Garzon's computer equipment to determine whether or not any files were taken or copied. \"They have not taken what they have been looking for,\" Garzon told El Periodico, and told Ser magazine that his clients\u2019 security \u201chas not been affected,\u201d and that the people \"acted very quickly.\" Hours after the break-in, and shortly before WikiLeaks tweeted the original article from El Pa\u00eds, Julian Assange called a Jimmy Dore video \" Brilliant\" which prominently features Assange's interview with a Dutch television host in which the WikiLeaks founder all but used sign language to indicate slain DNC Seth Rich was his source. (Assange clip at 21:30) Then, on Christmas Eve, Julian Assange's Twitter account was mysteriously deleted, only to be restored hours later with no explanation. Meanwhile, the US Navy's official Twitter account shot off the following tweet later that day: Shortly after, the Navy deleted the tweet, explaining that \"an inadvertent keystroke by an authorized user of the U.S. Navy Office of Information's Digital Media Engagement Team caused the trending term \"Julian Assange\" to be tweeted from the Navy's official Twitter account\" and in a follow up tweet added that \"the inadvertent tweet was briefly posted for a few second before it was quickly deleted by the same authorized user. The inadvertent tweet was sent during routine monitoring of trending topics.\" Adding to the mystery, in an official statement, WikiLeaks noted that apart from increased surveillance at the Ecuadorian embassy, the 46-year-old Australian was fine. \u201cDespite some oddities from the US Navy and Twitter today and increased physical surveillance @JulianAssange\u2019s physical situation at the embassy remains unaltered--confined without charge in violation of two UN rulings requiring the UK to set him free,\u201d the statement read. Between the break-in at their lawyer's office, the strange Twitter account incident and the weird tweet from the Navy - perhaps Cassandra Fairbanks is WikiLeaks' last hope.","label":1}
{"text":"Caravan of asylum seekers ask to be let into US: Some of the nearly 100 migrants from Central America and Mexico have been allowed to enter the U.S. as they seek asylum, but the road for them is far from over. (CNN) TIJUANA, Mexico \u2014 U.S. border inspectors allowed some of the Central American asylum seekers to enter the country for processing, ending a brief impasse over lack of space. Now, the migrants who crossed Mexico in a caravan may face a long legal path. Nearly 100 migrants from Central America, Mexico seek asylum Some are trying to get out of native countries filled with gang violence Vice President Mike Pence says caravan is trying to \"undermine\" U.S. laws Some of the nearly 100 migrants from Central America and Mexico have been allowed to enter the U.S. as they seek asylum, but the road for them is far from over. Men, women and children of all ages are part of this caravan that has been moving from Honduras, into El Salvador, and then Mexico. Over the weekend, they reached the U.S. border and many are currently being blocked from entering the states. They have arrived in Tijuana, the famous Mexican city that borders southern California, just outside of San Diego. Border patrol agents in San Diego have let a handful of people through to process them, where they will then be held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Vice President Mike Pence spoke in front of border patrol and pledged to build the wall. \"This situation is a direct result of our weak immigration laws and our porous border. This caravan, like those who have gone before, is also rightly understood as a deliberate attempt to undermine the laws of this country and the sovereignty of the United States,\" said Pence. While the roughly 100 migrants at the border say they need to be let in now before it is too late for them. A grandmother of two, Isabel Rodriguez, says she is fleeing El Salvador because of the growing gang violence and wants to be given asylum in the U.S. \"Mr. Trump, just like you allowed our fellow brothers and sisters from Central America to live in the country, allow us the opportunity. We want to work, we don't want handouts. We want a better future for our family,\" pleaded Rodriguez. American attorneys who volunteered advice in Tijuana last week warned the Central Americans that parents may be separated from their children and be detained for many months while their asylum cases are pending. Asylum-seekers are typically held up to three days at the border and turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. If they pass an asylum officer\u2019s initial screening, they may be detained or released with ankle monitors while their cases wind through immigration court, which can take years. Nearly 80 percent of asylum-seekers passed the initial screening from October through December, but few are likely to win asylum. The denial rate for El Salvadorans seeking asylum was 79 percent from 2012 to 2017, according to Syracuse University\u2019s Transactional Records Action Clearinghouse. Hondurans were close behind with a 78 percent denial rate, followed Guatemalans at 75 percent. Trump administration officials have railed against what they call \"legal loopholes\" and \"catch-and-release\u201d policies that allow people seeking asylum to be freed while their cases are adjudicated. The president tweeted Monday that the caravan \"shows how weak  ; ineffective U.S. immigration laws are.\" Attorney General Jeff Sessions has pledged to send more immigration judges to the border if needed and threatened criminal prosecution. On Monday, the Justice Department said it filed illegal entry charges against 11 people identified as caravan members. The Associated Press contributed to this story.","label":0}

{"text":"Could the Baltimore County executive race come down to NRA support?: A bump stock is an alteration that allows a semiautomatic rifle to fire like an automatic weapon (Los Angeles Times video) Polls indicate that a majority of Americans favor a host of gun control restrictions, including safe storage laws, the right to sue negligent dealers and barring domestic abusers from having guns. The NRA has successfully blocked such measures \u2014 and in fact, pushed the nation in the opposite direction, loosening gun laws over the last decade. Why is this? The answer, unfortunately, is that voters who support stronger gun control neglect to hold lawmakers accountable for kowtowing to the NRA. That may well change, with the youth leading the way after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting this year, laying bare the cowardice of lawmakers and pressing the need for basic gun control measures. In this year\u2019s elections across the nation, voters have the opportunity to set things straight by electing lawmakers who will stand up to the NRA and enact sensible gun laws. It turns out Baltimore County voters will have this choice. Democratic State Sen. Jim Brochin, who is running for Baltimore County Executive, has repeatedly stood up to the NRA and backed sensible gun laws. Meanwhile his opponent in the Democratic primary, Johnny Olszewski Jr. \u2014 who has earned the backing of the Baltimore County Progressive Democrats Club \u2014 has repeatedly done the NRA\u2019s bidding. Both legislators once drew praise from the NRA, but that changed with the Sandy Hook shooting in December 2012. Senator Brochin cut ties with the increasingly reckless gun lobby, and supported Maryland\u2019s landmark Firearms Safety Act, which strengthened gun restrictions \u2014 banning the sale of assault weapons in the state, limiting the size of gun magazines and requiring handgun purchasers to undergo licensing and safety training. In so doing, Senator Brochin appears to have followed his conscience and done what he felt was the right thing, enacting sensible and moderate gun safety rules. He surely knew this was a political risk, as he had just been redistricted into a more conservative district, including Northern Baltimore County all the way to the Pennsylvania state line \u2014 all of whose local and state representatives were already Republican, except for Senator Brochin. He displayed courage in standing up to the NRA in support of this landmark legislation. Shockingly, Mr. Olszewski submitted to the NRA and as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates voted against the 2013 Firearms Safety Act. This while he served a district that was represented at the time entirely by a Democratic delegation. For his loyalty to the gun lobby, Mr. Olszewski received an A rating from the NRA and was a 2014 beneficiary of the NRA victory fund. If he hoped this might earn him support from conservative voters, he was wrong; Mr. Olszewski lost his bid for state senator in the 2014 elections. These politicians have a history of casting dissimilar votes on common sense gun legislation. In 2009, Senator Brochin supported a measure to confiscate guns from domestic violence suspects who had received a temporary protective order against them. This is an effective policy for making domestic violence incidents less deadly. As Everytown for Gun Safety points out, \u201cThe presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation makes it five times more likely that a woman will be killed.\u201d Mr. Olszewski voted against taking guns away from people with a temporary protective order against them. Though Senator Brochin represents a markedly more conservative district, he has continued to be re-elected \u2014 and continues to vote his conscience on guns. Senator Brochin is a co-sponsor of the bill to ban bump stocks, which can transform semiautomatic rifles into fully automatic rifles. This mechanism was used by the Las Vegas shooter, who killed 56 people and injured 300 last October. This bill passed in the legislature Wednesday. Senator Brochin has also endorsed legislation to dissolve the Maryland State Handgun Permit Review Board, where Gov. Larry Hogan has appointed NRA sympathizers who appear to green light applicants over the concerns of law enforcement. Siding with the gun safety group Marylanders to Prevent Gun Violence, Senator Brochin favors giving permit decisions to administrative law judges, who will do so objectively and independently, with public safety foremost in mind. As the mass shootings mount \u2014 Orlando is followed by Las Vegas, followed by Sutherland Springs, Texas; followed by Parkland, Fla. \u2014 the American public is waking up to the gun laws in their midst. They realize that their lawmakers have been selling out to the NRA and enacting reckless gun laws. Senator Jim Brochin is a notable exception to this depressing trend; voters who care about reducing gun violence must support him in the upcoming election for Baltimore County Executive.

{"text":"Black-clad anarchists storm Berkeley rally, assaulting 5: BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Black-clad anarchists on Sunday stormed into what had been a largely peaceful Berkeley protest against hate and attacked at least five people, including the leader of a politically conservative group who canceled an event a day earlier in San Francisco amid fears of violence. The group of more than 100 hooded protesters, with shields emblazoned with the words \u201cno hate\u201d and waving a flag identifying themselves as anarchists, busted through police lines, avoiding security checks by officers to take away possible weapons. Then the anarchists blended with a crowd of 2,000 largely peaceful protesters who turned up to demonstrate in a \u201cRally Against Hate\u201d opposed to a much smaller gathering of right-wing protesters. Berkeley police chief Andrew Greenwood defended how police handled the protest, saying they made a strategic decision to let the anarchists enter to avoid more violence. Greenwood said \u201cthe potential use of force became very problematic\u201d given the thousands of peaceful protesters in the park. Once anarchists arrived, it was clear there would not be dueling protests between left and right so he ordered his officers out of the park and allowed the anarchists to march in. There was \u201cno need for a confrontation over a grass patch,\u201d Greenwood said. Hundreds of people are marching around San Francisco\u2019s Alamo Square park holding signs condemning white supremacists and chanting, \u201cWhose streets? Our streets!\u201d (Aug. 26) Among those assaulted was Joey Gibson, the leader of the Patriot Prayer group, which canceled a Saturday rally and was then prevented from holding a news conference when authorities closed off the public square Gibson planned to use. Gibson has denounced racism and said he launched Patriot Prayer after several supporters of President Donald Trump were beaten at a Trump campaign stop in San Jose, California, last year. Authorities nonetheless feared the group\u2019s event could attract white nationalists, as it has in the past. After the anarchists spotted Gibson at the Berkeley park, they pepper-sprayed him and chased him out as he backed away with his hands held in the air. Gibson rushed behind a line of police wearing riot gear, who set off a smoke bomb to drive away the anarchists. Separately, groups of hooded, black-clad protesters attacked at least four other men in or near the park, kicking and punching them until the assaults were stopped by police. The assaults were witnessed by an Associated Press reporter. Police in the San Francisco area have been braced for violence and trying to prevent protests that draw left-wing and right-wing opponents since the deadly confrontation in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12 that occurred during a rally of white supremacists. Berkeley authorities did not issue a permit for Sunday\u2019s gathering of right-wing protesters. Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin had urged counterprotesters to stay away from Civic Center Park. The right-wing event had been canceled by organizer Amber Cummings, who encouraged supporters to stay away but said she would attend on her own. By mid-afternoon Cummings had not appeared and left-wing protesters far outnumbered right-wing supporters. Earlier in the day, police had set up barricades around park and checked people who entered to make sure they did not have prohibited items like baseball bats, dogs, skateboards and scarves or bandanas they could use to cover their faces. Officers arrested 13 people, most for having prohibited items, Greenwood said. At one point, an anti-rally protester denounced a Latino man holding a \u201cGod Bless Donald Trump\u201d sign. \u201cYou are an immigrant,\u201d Karla Fonseca said. \u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself.\u201d Several other people also yelled at the man, who said he was born in Mexico but supports Trump\u2019s proposal to build a wall along the southern border. Police pulled one supporter of President Donald Trump out of the park over a wall by his shirt as a crowd of about two dozen counter-demonstrators surrounded him and chanted \u201cNazi go home\u201d and pushed him toward the edge of the park. At least two people were detained by officers for wearing bandannas covering their faces. Anti-rally protesters chanted slogans \u201cNo Trump. No KKK. No fascist USA\u201d and carried signs that said: \u201cBerkeley Stands United Against Hate.\u201d A separate group of counterprotesters had assembled earlier Sunday at the nearby University of California, Berkeley campus and then marched park to merge with the anti-rally protesters who had already gathered there. Both Cummings and Gibson have disavowed racism and say they wanted to hold the rallies to bring conservative voices to the liberal San Francisco Bay Area. Student activism was born during the 1960s free-speech movement at Berkeley, when thousands of students at the university mobilized to demand that the school drop its ban on political activism. However, the violence in Charlottesville led San Francisco area police and civil leaders to rethink their response to protests. ___ Associated Press writers Terry Chea and Marcio Sanchez in Berkeley contributed to this report.","label":0}

{"text":"ISIS releases article on US election: Unable to play video. HTML5 is not supported! The Islamic State's English-language media wing on Saturday released an article about the U.S. presidential election, three days before Americans take to the polls. The seven-page PDF warns American Muslims to not participate in voting for either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump and quotes verses from the Quran to demonstrate why democracy is antithetical to Islam. ISIS's al-Hayat Media Center released the article, called \"The Murtadd Vote,\" (\"The Apostate Vote\") on social media platforms such as Twitter and Telegram. It is a screed against American politics and democracy, which it refers to as \"paganism.\" One of the main arguments it puts forward is that American Muslims who participate in elections are apostates because they have directly contributed to other Muslims being killed in America's numerous wars. \"And after almost thirty years of history proving to the entire world that there is no difference between the American Republican and Democratic parties in their policies against Islam and Muslims, the murtadd imams of the so-called 'Muslim Brotherhood' and its sister sects continue to advocate voting in the pagan festivals of U.S. democracy,\" the article reads. Additionally, the piece says that any manmade laws and democratic institutions amount to idolatry (in Arabic, taghut, or its plural, tawaghit) and should therefore be shunned by Muslims. \"Accordingly, human legislators, manmade laws, modern constitutions, judges who rule thereby, and rulers who enforce such upon others are all tawaghit whom the Muslim must disassociate from and disbelieve in,\" it reads. The article also uses this same argument as a justification for violence: \"Hence, as it is clear that the voter is a part of the taghut of democracy \u2014 'the power of the people' \u2014 and that the voters are directly involved in the decision making process by choosing delegates to represent them and their whims executively, judicially, and legislatively, the blood of Crusader voters is even more deserving of being spilled than the blood of Crusader combatants.\" \"The Murtadd Vote\" ends on a grim note, hoping that November 8 ends in horror for the American public. \"May Allah make this year's U.S. presidential election a dreadful calamity like no other to have struck America throughout its pathetic history,\" it reads.

{"text":"No Amnesty Is a Good Amnesty: Donald Trump is being told that amnesty for \u201cDreamers,\u201d or DACA recipients, will only apply to a small, narrowly defined group of totally innocent, eminently deserving illegal immigrants, who were brought to this country \u201cthrough no fault of their own\u201d as \u201cchildren.\u201d (Children who are up to 36 years old.) Every syllable of that claim is a lie, and I can prove it. To see how DACA will actually work, let\u2019s look at another extremely limited amnesty that was passed in 1986. Farmers wanted temporary guest-worker permits for their cheap labor, so that they could continue pretending that the Industrial Revolution never happened and refuse to mechanize. (And, boy, did that work! We haven\u2019t heard a peep about \u201ccrops rotting in the fields\u201d since then.) The agricultural amnesty was supposed to apply to \u2014 at most \u2014 350,000 illegal aliens. It would be available only to illegals who were currently in the country doing the back-breaking farm work that no American would do. Without them, crops would wither on the vine. They were saving us from starvation! Talk about deserving. Are any Dreamers saving us from starvation? But instead of guest-worker permits, then-Rep. Charles Schumer \u2014 from the lush farmland of Brooklyn \u2014 decided to grant full amnesty to any illegals who had done farm work for at least 90 days in the previous year. That\u2019s pretty restrictive, isn\u2019t it? In the end, \u201cup to 350,000 farm workers\u201d turned into 1.3 million. Oh well, what are you going to do? No use worrying \u2014 let\u2019s just move forward and get all these people voter registration cards! This innocent little amnesty for a small, clearly defined group of illegals quickly became amnesty for anyone who applied. The same thing will happen with any other amnesty, no matter how strictly the law is written. (And it won\u2019t be written strictly.) In the first few years of the agricultural amnesty, internal Immigration and Naturalization Service statistics showed that 888,637 legalization applications were fraudulent. According to immigration agents, \u201cfarm workers\u201d stated in their interviews that cotton was purple or that they had pulled cherries from the ground. Of the 888,637 fraudulent applications, guess how many our government approved. Answer: More than 800,000. The agricultural amnesty was so carefully administered that not one, but TWO of the 1993 World Trade Center bombers were in this country because of it. (More on that in another column.) The main problem with the farm worker amnesty, the DACA amnesty or any amnesty is that everyone involved in the entire immigration apparatus is feverishly working, on the taxpayer\u2019s dime, to transform this country into a Third World hellhole. Lawyers for La Raza and lawyers for the government both believe it is their mission to humiliate and destroy white Christian America. (Actually, this country is \u201cbiracial Christian America,\u201d plus a few Amerindians and anyone else who assimilated to Western European culture.) There are multitudes of them, and they will never, ever stop. Congress could pass a law granting amnesty to any 7-foot-tall, left-handed, red-headed illegal aliens from Lichtenstein \u2014 and hundreds of left-wing outfits would instantly set to work, demanding amnesty for witch doctors, cannibals, pederasts, terrorists and the rest of the multicultural universe that makes America so vibrant. On the other side of the application process would be government immigration bureaucrats who either used to work at La Raza, or hope to in the future. On the off chance that some particularly risible amnesty application is denied by a stodgy rules-follower in our immigration bureaucracy, that denial will be litigated before a federal judge in Hawaii, then appealed to the Ninth Circuit. For two decades after the 1986 amnesty, the federal courts were tied up with dozens of class-action lawsuits brought on behalf of illegal aliens \u2014 regular illegal aliens, farm worker illegal aliens and still-in-Mexico illegal aliens \u2014 challenging every aspect of the law. Is that how American tax dollars should be spent? On endless litigation, brought by America-hating activists on behalf of people who have no right to be in our country and decided by Democrat-appointed judges? (Who are also America-hating activists.) And when their work is done, there will be a lot more Democrat-appointed judges because there will be a lot more Democrats. Lawyers sued over everything \u2014 the absence of Creole interpreters, the requirement that illegals have proof of prior farm work and the rare denials of amnesty. Congress desperately tried passing laws that would prevent courts from hearing these cases \u2014 all to no avail. Left-wing lawyers just had to pick the right judge, and they won. In 2005 \u2014 nearly 20 years after the 1986 amnesty \u2014 the Ninth Circuit was still granting amnesty to hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens who claimed they had been unfairly denied because they were not in the country for the first amnesty. Seriously. No matter how the law is written, as long as anyone is eligible for amnesty, everybody\u2019s getting amnesty. President Trump is the last president who will ever have a chance to make the right decision on immigration. After this, it\u2019s over. The boat will have sailed. If he succeeds, all the p@ssy-grabbing and Russia nonsense will burn off like a morning fog. He will be the president who saved the American nation, its character, its sovereignty, its core identity. But if he fails, Donald Trump will go down in history as the man who killed America.","label":1}

Cayley Mackay: My home is located on the beautiful Caribbean island of Sint Maarten. Hurricane Irma was a level 5+ as they were experiencing winds and conditions much worse than a typical Category 5. It was largest hurricane in history in the Atlantic and according to the New York Times \u201chas broken records for accumulated cyclone energy, a measure that combines storm strength and duration\u201d. The eye hit Sint Maarten and was so large that satellite imagery shower the entire island in the eye of Irma. AfterEllen: What did you return to when you got back? Cayley Mackay: There is no power. No water. No hospital. No airport. No nothing. My girlfriend Nicole and I were away representing Sint Maarten at the Ironman 70.3 World Championships when the hurricane hit. We did not hear from our family for over 48 hours. We are not able to return to the island yet as there are no flights, at this point it is only evacuation flights allowed to enter and that is recent. Sint Maarten Before Hurricane Irma Sint Maarten After Hurricane Irma AfterEllen: How many others are going through this on your Island? Cayley Mackay: The island is 37.2 square miles and is divided between Dutch (Sint Maarten) and French (Saint Martin). The population of the entire island is around 100,000 people and every single person has been affected. Most of our friends and family have lost their homes, lost their businesses, lost everything. If you still have a roof over your head (literally because thousands of roofs were ripped off) you are considered to be very lucky right now. There are dozens of deaths and we still have friends who are unaccounted for. AfterEllen: What are you and others doing to cope with the devastation? Cayley Mackay: Nicole and I are doing everything in our power to get the word out that SXM needs international aid. We have been fundraising for the island ( www.rebuildsxm.com) and also four ourselves as we have also suffered extensive damage ( www.gofundme.com\/nicoleandcayley). We have also been helping to evacuate as many people and animals as possible. Yesterday we were able to arrange for the evacuation of Nicole\u2019s very ill grandmother to a hospital in Aruba as well as her grandfather and goddaughter. Those at home have been trying to survive. People have been running out of water and food. Saturday, Sept. 9, they were under hurricane warning from Hurricane Jose so people were trying to find safe places to stay that had not already been destroyed by Irma. It is definitely survival mode. But the people of Sint Maarten\/Saint Martin are resilient. They are helping each other in as many ways as possible, sharing food and water and providing shelter when they can. Of course there are also those who are taking advantage of the situation and there has been wide spread looting and crime however most are doing their best to help. The spirit I have seen from home is unmatched. AfterEllen: How can those reading this article help? Cayley Mackay: The biggest thing right now is to spread the word. Irma has destroyed so many. Most recently it has affected Florida and most of the big news stations are turning away from showing the damage and destruction on the islands to show Florida. Please don\u2019t forget about us! We are an isolated island and will not be able to rebuild on our own. We need the world to know how much help we need so the first thing people can do is help us to spread the word. The second thing is to donate. Money donations can be sent to www.rebuildsxm.com and care packages are being put together throughout the world to send. Nicole and I are only one of tens of thousands who have been affected and we still do not know the full report of damage but we do know that it is extensive. If you are interested in donating to us personally you can do so at www.gofundme.com\/nicoleandcayley. AfterEllen: Is there anything else you would like us to know? Cayley Mackay: The world lost contact with Sint Maarten around 6:30am on Wednesday September 6th when the eye hit. The last thing we heard was Nicole\u2019s mom screaming at her dad to get back because he was trying to hold the doors shut and her grandmother crying and screaming that the roof was coming off. Her uncles roof has already come off. We then waited over 48 hours in a numb state waiting to hear if they had survived. Our story is normal. The destruction is unimaginable. Lives have been changed forever. We need help. The island needs help. Please don\u2019t forget about us.

{"text":"Facebook Gave a Neo-Nazi Website a Huge Assist in Spreading Hate After Charlottesville: Photo Credit: Curt Johnson\/Flickr If you\u2019re following the Daily Stormer drama, you know that the alt-right neo-Nazi site is in hot water. After Heather Heyer was killed in a domestic terrorist attack following the white supremacist rally and ensuing riot in Charlottesville over the weekend, the Daily Stormer published a venomous article denouncing Heyer as a \u201cFat, Childless 32-Year-Old Slut.\u201d GoDaddy has revoked the website\u2019s domain name, and Google is punishing it too. That\u2019s all well and good, but you may have missed Facebook\u2019s huge role in helping the piece going viral. Over the weekend, the article was a top result in Facebook searches under the \u201cNews\u201d category, earning a massive share count. One reader reported on Twitter that the piece had been shared on Facebook 90K times as of Monday night.  also if ur wondering how garbage like daily stormer is disseminated, that story has 65 THOUSAND shares on @facebook  ; is listed under news. pic.twitter.com\/KykJOjPbq8\u2014 susie banikarim (@banikarim) August 13, 2017  The Daily Stormer is a self-proclaimed white supremacist site that routinely targets African Americans, Jews, and Arabs, promotes the use of the hashtag #HitlerWasRight and endorses the use of eugenics, among countless other offenses. It's vile, even beyond the likes of Breitbart and the Daily Caller. It\u2019s not news that Facebook\u2019s algorithm has a huge impact on the Daily Stormer\u2019s (and all other publishers\u2019) readership. In 2016, Gizmodo reported that Facebook News curators admitted to suppressing right-wing stories, greatly impacting traffic to those sites. The social media platform came under fire again for boosting fake news stories during the 2016 election, and since then, has been on a crusade against fake news with the help of fact-checking organizations like Poynter and Snopes. To reverse the damage it helped cause, Facebook is now deleting links to the Daily Stormer article about Heather Heyer. But it's far too little, too late. There will always be evil, offensive people like the writers and editors at the Daily Stormer who will spin a tragedy like Charlottesville into cash. But the real danger lies in media monoliths like Facebook promoting their work. Certainly, the site has done a much better job than Twitter derailing hate speech on the internet. But many thousands of readers only found that Daily Stormer piece because Facebook automatically and unwittingly characterized it as \u201cnews.\u201d In digital media, where pageviews from even the most odious sources mean advertising revenue, the Daily Stormer will probably be laughing all the way to the bank.

(AP Photo\/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) President Donald Trump blamed \"many sides\" for violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in the wake of a white nationalist demonstration. His comments drew swift reactions. Democrats and some Republicans called on him to specifically denounce white supremacy and racially motivated hate by name. Vice President Mike Pence supported the president's speech. A white supremacist website praised the comments. What Trump said: \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides,\" Trump said. \"It's been going on for a long time in our country. Not Donald Trump. Not Barack Obama. It's been going on for a long, long time.\" What others are saying: \u2014 \"I'm not going to make any bones about it.

{"text":"Ben Affleck Groped This Popular TV Host, and Now She\u2019s Coming Forward: In the wake of numerous reports of upsetting sexual assault allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein, many celebrities have come forward to share their shock and disgust. One of those celebrities was Ben Affleck. The actor, who worked with Weinstein on Good Will Hunting, released a statement on Facebook saying he was \"saddened and angry that a man who I worked with used his power to intimidate, sexually harass and manipulate many women.\" He wrote that \"we must support those who come forward\" and \"condemn this type of behavior when we see it.\" Rose McGowan wasn't buying it, though, and now, former TRL host Hilarie Burton has come forward to remind everyone that Affleck himself groped her on the show back in 2003. According to Rose McGowan, Affleck was fully aware of Weinstein's behavior and even \"told him to stop doing that.\"  @benaffleck \u201cGODDAMNIT! I TOLD HIM TO STOP DOING THAT\u201d you said that to my face. The press conf I was made to go to after assault. You lie.\u2014 rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) October 10, 2017  \u201cYou lie,\u201d she wrote on Twitter after Affleck released his statement stating that he was supposedly \u201cangry\u201d and sickened by the news about Weinstein. Affleck told McGowan to her face that he was aware that Weinstein harassed women and that he advised him to cut it out. Then he made it seem as if he was totally shocked by the reports. McGowan had a few short words for the deceptive actor:  Ben Affleck fuck off  But it seems that Affleck won\u2019t actually be leaving the news cycle for some time, as a TRL fan came forward to remind everyone that the actor who was so shocked and saddened that Harvey Weinstein could harass women is a harasser himself. Actress Hilarie Burton was the host of Total Request Live in 2003 when she was just 21 years old. On Tuesday night, October 10, after Ben Affleck released his statement and after Rose McGowan called him out, Burton replied to a tweet reminding everyone that she was actually harassed by Ben Affleck on TRL back in the day. You can watch it here: This wasn\u2019t that long ago. It happened on air. They commented on it. Burton had to laugh and move on at the time because she was on the job. Men, even supposedly upstanding ones who \"condemn\" sexual harassment, often feel entitled to women's bodies and believe that there's nothing wrong with that. That's sickening.  https:\/\/t.co\/wh2MpJVQzlGirls. I'm so impressed with you brave ones. I had to laugh back then so I wouldn't cry. Sending love.  The harassment of women has become so normalized that men like Ben Affleck don\u2019t even think they\u2019ve done something wrong when they grope a woman\u2019s breast without her consent. That, or he really is just a total lying skeeze. Honestly, could be either one.","label":0}

So, that the two would butt heads would seem all but inevitable, but McCain\u2019s Liberty Medal speech is just the latest shot in a lengthy war. Let\u2019s run down a brief history of the barbs these two have exchanged, which all began around the time that Trump announced his presidential candidacy. July 18, 2015: Trump fires the first shot by saying that he \u201clikes people who weren\u2019t captured,\u201d which was a reference to McCain\u2019s years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. Trump refuses to apologize despite enormous criticism from GOP leadership, including from McCain\u2019s good friend, Senator Lindsay Graham. July 21, 2015: Trump delivers an apology on Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show that many viewed as insincere. September 9, 2015: Trump\u2019s remarks are revived again when it comes out he believed going to prep school was better than actual military service in terms of service to one\u2019s country. August 1, 2016: McCain distances both himself and the GOP from Trump\u2019s attacks on the service of Humayun S. M. Khan and his parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan:  \u201cIn recent days, Donald Trump disparaged a fallen soldier\u2019s parents. He has suggested that the likes of their son should not be allowed in the United States \u2014 to say nothing of entering its service. I cannot emphasize enough how deeply I disagree with Mr. Trump\u2019s statement. I hope Americans understand that the remarks do not represent the views of our Republican Party, its officers, or candidates.\u201d  August 2, 2016: Trump refuses to endorse McCain for reelection. The refusal has no impact whatsoever on McCain\u2019s poll numbers. October 8, 2016: McCain withdraws his endorsement of Trump over the Access Hollywood hot mic scandal. October 11, 2016: Trump complains that McCain won\u2019t vote for him and refers to him as \u201cfoul-mouthed.\u201d November 21, 2016: In response to Trump\u2019s remarks about \u201cenhanced interrogation,\u201d McCain bluntly informs Trump that the U.S. is not allowed to torture people. January 11, 2017: It\u2019s revealed that John McCain informed the FBI of the notorious Steele dossier, which included, among other claims, that Trump paid prostitutes to urinate on a bed in which Obama once slept. February 2, 2017: After a bizarrely contentious call with the Prime Minister of Australia, John McCain expresses America\u2019s unwavering support for the nation.

He opened the floor to Fox News' John Roberts, who said, \u201cYour pin is upside down.\u201d Spicer responded, \u201cJohn Roberts always helping me with the fashion tips.\u201d Spicer moved the pin, but that wasn\u2019t enough. He was told again it was upside down and then asked if it was distress call. He jokingly laughed with the reporters and told them it wasn\u2019t a distress call.

In protest to the coming visit of right wing speaker and blogger, Milo Yiannopoulos, the Antifa went on a burning, pillaging and plundering rampage, like 21st Century Visigoths across the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, as the local police looked on and did nothing. During a May Dayin Portland, Oregon, violence erupted resulting in 25 arrests after Antifa protesters allegedly attacked police officers, emergency workers and destroyed property resulting in the city pulling the parade permit. The Antifa website, It\u2019s Going Down, https:\/\/itsgoingdown.org\/ preaches violence and encourages its supporters to attack conservatives and anyone considered a fascist. And, now the Antifa, are vowing to wreak havoc at Gettysburg National Park tomorrow and this weekend, on the 154th anniversary of the most famous and decisive battle of the Civil War. The Antifa is apparently planning on desecrating Confederate monuments, statues and graves, while also burning the Confederate flag. The Sons of Confederate Veterans and various reenactor groups, both Union and Confederate will be on the battlefield this weekend. If the Antifa wants a fight, they will be obliged. If the Antifa thinks that they\u2019re going to destroy property at Gettysburg like they did at Berkeley, in Washington, DC and in Portland, they\u2019re sorely mistaken. The left is unhinged, deranged and seeking violence. Eventually, if you seek to do harm to property and innocent citizens, the law of physics will boomerang back to you in the shape of a fist, a club, a knife, a bottle or a gun. The left\u2019s blood lust and violence is going to end one way and one way only, when the right counter-punches. Have no doubt, it\u2019s coming and when the right finally reacts the response will come like a mighty thunderclap in the night. The Antifa are left wing scum and nothing more.","label":1}
{"text":"Lil Wayne's 'Nightline' Fail Shows Why Asking Celebrities For More Than What They Sell Leads To Disappointment: Thaddaeus McAdams\/FilmMagic Who is Lil Wayne to most? It\u2019s an important question to ask when even trying to put his words and actions in context. He\u2019s a marvelous, prolific rap artist known for witty, spastic wordplay\u2014often dipping from lines about feeling like an alien-like outcast to outlandish quips about sexual exploits. \"So misunderstood, but what\u2019s a world without enigma?\u201d he wonders on his 2010 classic \u201c6 Foot 7 Foot.\u201d That\u2019s immediately followed by \u201cTwo bitches at the same time, [like] synchronized swimmers.\u201d Raps like that and many more about grinding to achieve goals, then celebrating those wins have made the Grammy-winning rhymer one of the best ever in his genre. On Wednesday (Nov. 2), Lil Wayne (real name Dwyane Carter) landed in hot water after ABC News' Nightline aired an interview with the rapper. Attached to promotion of his Gone Till November book, a jail memoir about his months spent in New York\u2019s Rikers Island on gun possession charges, the interview took a turn when reporter Linsey Davis asked him about his, at times, misogynistic lyrics: \"Would you have a problem with [your daughter] being called a b-tch or a ho?\" Already causing a stir with his controversial September interview with FS1\u2019s sports talk show Skip and Shannon: Undisputed where Wayne claimed \"that there was no such thing as racism no more\" -- given the white audiences his concerts attract -- Davis then asked him about his thoughts on the Black Lives Matter movement. Wayne, to her apparent surprise, asked that she explain it to him. Then, perhaps feeling attacked, he became defensive. \"I am a young Black rich motherf--ker,\" Wayne began. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t let you know that America understands Black n---as matter these days, I don\u2019t know what it is. Don\u2019t come at me with that dumb shit, ma\u2019am. My life matters, especially to my b-tches. I don't feel connected to a damn thing that ain't got nothin' to do with me. If you do, you're crazy as shit.\u201d He proceeded to tell Davis what he is connected to by whipping out a red bandana from his back pocket, seemingly to show his affiliation to the Bloods, a Los Angeles gang with branches all over the country. Interview over. First, let\u2019s address the massive levels of isolation and ignorance it takes to not know what \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d is about in 2016. It\u2019s beyond difficult to believe that an artist who\u2019s as connected to the outside world as Lil Wayne doesn't know what\u2019s going on in it. By virtue of being a massive sports fan alone, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s stance against the National Anthem is an unavoidable entry point to the issues of Black America for Wayne. Aside from his alleged Bloods affiliation, Wayne\u2019s connected to something that hits closer to home: his family. In the aforementioned Undisputed interview, Wayne thoughtfully explained that his children are his only true concern. \u201cMy politics, my flag, my country, my nation, my world are [my children] Reginae, Cameron, Neal and his brother [Dwayne]. That\u2019s all that matters.\" Fair enough. But there is an obvious connection to be made with a 34-year-old Black father raising three Black sons and one Black daughter, and wanting them (and the world they grow up in) to be safe from potentially racist, gun-happy cops. Yes, fame can, and often does, gift those with it a freedom from traditional prejudices but it\u2019s hard to accept that Wayne\u2019s that far gone. Certainly not when he has songs in his catalog that speak directly to social injustice and racism. Months removed from 2005\u2019s Hurricane Katrina, which annihilated Wayne\u2019s native New Orleans, the rapper released what arguably is his most politically heated song to date \"Georgia\u2026 Bush.\" It\u2019s a cut that attacks then President George Bush, the U.S. government for their negligence in dispersing FEMA aid to the mostly African American refugees in Louisiana, and the media reporting on it. \"Boy them cops is killas in my home,\" he spits on the \u201906 track. \"N---a shot dead in the middle of the street\/I ain't no thief, I'm just trying to eat\/Man, f--k the police and President (Georgia) Bush.\u201d Just this year, Wayne was a featured guest on Solange Knowles critically acclaimed A Seat At The Table -- arguably the Blackest album of 2016 in terms of addressing social issues of today from track one to completion -- for the song \" Mad.\" Here, Solange sings to fellow Blacks about how it\u2019s okay to be frustrated about how the system treats African Americans. Wayne jumps in to let loose about feeling stressed, including a few bars on what it\u2019s like to be an affluent man that looks like he does when visiting his financial institution. \"Then I walk up in the bank, pants sagging down,\u201d he raps. \"And I laugh at frowns, what they mad about? 'Cause here come this motherfucker with this mass account that didn't wear cap and gown\/Are you mad 'cause the judge ain't give me more time?\" As far as imagery goes it\u2019s not a stretch to assume that at least some of those with prejudices against him -- a young Black man -- are white people in that scenario. Lil Wayne knows what racism is -- and it\u2019s evident he\u2019s aware of it in 2016. So why not speak about it? As Wayne ripped the Nightline microphone pack from his chest and strolled off, he\u2019s heard saying, \"I ain\u2019t no f--king politician.\" That is true -- Lil Wayne is Lil Wayne and that\u2019s not what he\u2019s known for selling. There lies the plight faced by anyone hoping for Wayne, or anyone else of his stature, to be someone they are not. The risk of being disappointed is huge because simply put, artists, athletes and entertainers overall don\u2019t owe the world anything outside of what they became famous for. Here's Lil Wayne, a man who clearly doesn\u2019t want to speak about political issues, being asked to be as outspoken as some of his peers like Jay Z, Kendrick Lamar, T.I. and Common, who have spoken on BLM-related issues this year within their music, performances and social media. In an age where Black people feel like lesser beings (for obvious reasons, including umpteen senseless killings and the hands of policemen), it would help to have a figure as big as Lil Wayne join the fray as an outspoken representative. How impactful would it be to see all those Caucasian faces at a Lil Wayne show yelling \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d or rallying behind the cause in a significant way? Very. It hurts the cause and the culture to see Wayne throw up a Blood flag before tossing his snapback cap into the BLM ring. Later on Wednesday, Wayne issued an apology of sorts for his ill-conceived remarks, which also followed him being questioned about his misogyny. \"When the reporter began asking me questions about my daughter being labeled a bitch and a hoe, I got agitated,\u201d Wayne told TMZ. \u201cFrom there, there was no thought put into her questions and my responses. Apologies to anyone who was offended.\u201d Still, what\u2019s done is done. Many fans, followers, media outlets and social media users have already shown their disapproval of Wayne\u2019s negligence. He was even dubbed \"Donkey of the Day\" by Power 105. 1 radio jock Charlemagne The God just hours after the interview segment was released. According to TMZ, Wayne also fired his publicists after the Nightline episode aired. That old adage made famous by Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man continues to reign supreme: \"With great power comes great responsibility.\u201d Each time Wayne turns down an opportunity to speak up for his race or peters off from the conversations with easy outs like \u201cI\u2019m not even into it enough to give an opinion,\u201d he seems to carelessly swagger away from a hefty job that critics want him to want. Maybe he\u2019s afraid that being outspoken will hurt his bottom line and business dealings. Or maybe he just doesn\u2019t want to be bothered. This isn\u2019t a plea for his fans to cut Wayne some slack. For those angry at the rapper for his uncanny aloofness, it might be best to redirect your energy. As disappointed as you are that Lil Wayne chooses not to express sociopolitical views that encourage activism and justice for Black America, try doing everything in your power to propel and uplift the voices that do -- like a Common, who is actually releasing a hard-hitting, BLM-addressing album called Black America Again today (Nov. 4). That\u2019s a guy who, like many others, recognizes his power and is ready to fully utilize it. Lil Wayne isn\u2019t -- yet. But to be clear, he doesn\u2019t owe it to anyone to be like Muhammad Ali, whose words against injustice packed punches that rivaled those he threw as a boxer or Maya Angelou, who used her poetry to help others rise. Continue to expect street-savvy, colorful raps that top the charts and, sure, hope for more. Anything else from him would be a welcome bonus. Some people, for whatever their reasons may be, don\u2019t want to wear that cape. Though it would be nice if Lil Wayne did.","label":0}

{"text":"Trump schools Obama on U.S. Constitution:  In this Aug. 30, 2017, photo, President Donald Trump speaks about tax reform at the Loren Cook Company in Springfield, Mo. (AP Photo\/Alex Brandon) ANALYSIS\/OPINION: Everyone knows that former President Barack Obama, our Great American Constitutional Law Professor, got mercilessly schooled by the Supreme Court during his eight years in office. Now he is getting schooled by a brash-talking, orange-haired reality-TV star and real-estate developer from Queens. I mean, this is humiliating. And so delicious to watch! President Trump never took a single law class \u2014 at least not that we know of. Because if he had, Mr. Trump would surely find a way to remind us every time he wanted to strut his legal stuff. Anyway, Trump University didn\u2019t even have a law school. Yet, Mr. Trump effortlessly runs legal circles around the Great Law Lecturer Barack Obama when it comes to understanding the Constitution. The same Constitution Mr. Obama spent years studying. The same Constitution that Mr. Trump hires people to study for him. The same Constitution both men got elected to protect and uphold. The same Constitution Mr. Obama spray-painted graffiti all over and the same Constitution that Mr. Trump is \u2014 finally \u2014 rescuing. Whether it was Obamacare or the Defense of Marriage Act or illegal immigration, Mr. Obama made Swiss cheese of the most vital document in the modern civilized world. The document that spawned the greatest force for freedom on the planet. The document that \u2014 ultimately \u2014 freed slaves. The document that guarantees equality under law. Mr. Obama shredded it whenever it suited his twisted needs and perverted political greed. When he summarily rewrote the nation\u2019s immigration laws \u2014 legalizing millions of illegals \u2014 it came after years of even he, himself, insisting that the president had no such authority under the Constitution. That he later crumpled the Constitution \u2014 knowingly \u2014 in a cynical political gambit to woo Hispanic voters reveals just how constitutionally debauched Mr. Obama really was. Mr. Obama\u2019s blithe ignorance and selfish disregard of the Constitution was laid bare by a comprehensive study earlier this year that revealed that the Great Constitutional Law Lecturer had been rebuked by the Supreme Court more than any president in at least 70 years. And that was because the professors conducting the study only went back 70 years. And now, after eight years of Mr. Obama wagging his big legal finger at \u201cStupid America,\u201d we finally have a president who actually understands the Constitution and means to uphold it. \u2022 Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com and on Twitter, @charleshurt.

According to the Center for Internet Security, before the hurricane struck Florida, domain name registrations containing \"Irma\" sold like hotcakes. A total of 743 new domains have been sold since September 1. Many of them include words like \"Irma victims,\" \"relief,\" \"help\" and \"claims.\" Are they legit?

(ABC7) \u2014 A state of emergency has been declared in Virginia in response to a white nationalist rally held in Charlottesville's Emancipation Park Saturday, which drew hundreds of protesters, authorities say. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe released the following statement after declaring the state of emergency: \u201cIt is now clear that public safety cannot be safeguarded without additional powers, and that the mostly out-of-state protesters have come to Virginia to endanger our citizens and property,\" Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe said in a statement. \" I am disgusted by the hatred, bigotry and violence these protesters have brought to our state over the past 24 hours. The actions I have taken are intended to assist local government and restore public safety. Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer said that one person, a 32-year-old woman, has died and 19 people were injured at the site of a car crash during the violence Saturday. Police have not released the cause of the crash, however the driver of the vehicle, later identified as James Alex Fields, Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, is now in police custody. The UVA Health System says out of those injured, five patients are in critical condition, four are in serious condition, six are in fair condition and four are in good condition.

Earlier, President Donald Trump sent his condolences to the state police officers who died in the crash via his Twitter page. He also sent his condolences to the family of the 32-year-old woman who was killed and his \"best regards\" to the others injured. Following the rally, an unlawful assembly was declared and police began making arrests during Saturday afternoon, authorities say. The Virginia National Guard was also brought in to help police clear the area. The white nationalists branded their gathering as the \"Unite the Right\" rally. The rally comes after a federal judge granted a temporary injunction allowing the gathering to be held. A local emergency was declared in Charlottesville earlier in the day. Charlottesville Police have released the following statement: \"Charlottesville City Manager Maurice Jones and Interim County Executive Doug Walker have simultaneously issued a Declaration of Local Emergency for the two jurisdictions. This joint declaration allows local officials to request additional resources if needed to respond to ongoing events in the community which are currently localized in downtown Charlottesville. Scheduled activities outside the downtown area are not impacted by ongoing events or by this declaration at this time. Local officials continue to closely monitor the situation and will provide additional details as they are available.\" President Donald Trump condemned the violence in Charlottesville hours before he addressed the incident during a press conference in New Jersey on Satursday afternoon saying:,\"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.\" Watch Trump during Saturday's presser on ABC7's Facebook Live below: First Lady Melania Trump tweeted out this response to the events in Charlottesville, asking for people to communicate without hate in their hearts. Former President Bill Clinton reiterated the first lady's point, writing that \"even as we protect free speech,\" Americans must \"condemn hatred, violence and white supremacy.\" Speaker of the House Paul Ryan also posted to social media, calling the views of the nationalist marchers\"repugnant\" and \"vile.\" He added he hoped that the violence would \"serve to unite Americans\" against bigotry. Hillary Clinton said in a tweet that her \"heart was in Charlottesville\" and with all those feeling unsafe. Virginia Senator Mark Warner released the following statement: David Duke, the former KKK leader, was at the rally earlier in the day, saying they were going to \"fulfill the promises of Donald Trump.\" Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, Charlottesville officials and local representatives held a press conference telling white nationalists to \"go home.\" The University of Virginia Medical Center was preparing to possibly treat patients on a \"natural disaster\" scale because of the event. Police say others in the crowd were using pepper spray. CNN, the Associated Press and the Washington Post reported multiple fights breaking out. White nationalist and Alt-Right Movement leader Richard Spencer claims that he and others were maced during the day. He was later arrested. According to the ACLU of Virginia, some of those protesting the rally were pepper sprayed. \u201cAs the former mayor of this beautiful, inclusive and progressive community, I am saddened that our city may draw thousands who would come here to sow division and hate,\u201d House Democratic Leader David J. Toscano said in a statement. \u201cThe alt-right agenda has been brought to Charlottesville by people who are neither from our community nor who represent its values. We will strive to ensure the day does not erupt into violence, and we will redouble our efforts to remain civically engaged so that darkness does not obscure our light.\u201d The organizers say they're demonstrating against moving a statue of confederate general Robert e. Lee from a city park. This comes just a day after so-called \"alt-right\" activists marched with torches on the University of Virginia campus. \u201cThe House Democratic Caucus stands in strong support of the City of Charlottesville and of every person who has been marginalized by discrimination and hate \u2013 whether through the coded dog whistles of politicians or by overt violence that we pray we won\u2019t see today,\u201d said Caucus Chair Charniele Herring in another statement. \u201cWe thank our law enforcement officers and first responders for putting their lives on the line, today and every day, to keep our communities safe.\u201d Police said they were expecting thousands of both protesters and counter-protesters.","label":0}

{"text":"At This Point, I Don\u2019t Care Why You Still Support This President: I care deeply about people. My efficacy and usefulness as a pastor and caregiver (and as a decent member of humanity), is predicated on knowing how people\u2019s hearts work, the way they think, how they respond to fear, what motivates and hurts them. Understanding human beings is my life\u2019s work. It is the work of every one of us striving for empathy regardless of profession or placement. There are times though, when people\u2019s actions are so profoundly damaging to others, that asking why isn\u2019t the most pressing question; moments when to belabor that question would be irresponsible to those at risk. When you come upon someone in the street inflicting violence on another human being, your first priority is to provide care for the injured, to protect others by moving them out of harm\u2019s way, and to stop the violent act in progress. Only then is seeking to understand the motivations of the aggressor helpful. Only then do you ask, \u201cWhy would someone do this?\u201d In the middle of the fray, when people are in danger\u2014there isn\u2019t time. People are in danger, in these moments. Right now I\u2019m not interested in knowing why those who still support this President do so, not because they don\u2019t matter or I don\u2019t see their worth or because their stories are of no interest to me\u2014but simply because other people\u2019s lives and families and personal safety are in the balance\u2014and those people merit my attention and urgency. The Jesus of my faith tradition was a shepherd. Yes he cared for the sheep, but he had to pushback hard against the wolves of the world to do it. Talking to embittered people right now and trying to understand their motivations may help explain the rationale for their destructive choices, but it does nothing to protect those affected by their choices, those who don\u2019t have the luxury of waiting around for an answer, those who don\u2019t have the privilege of time. And so in these moments, rather than trying to understand why someone would possibly advocate to take away a sick person\u2019s healthcare\u2014I am going to fight on behalf of the sick person and demand that all people be cared for under the laws of this land. Rather than asking why someone would want to take away an LGBTQ person\u2019s right to marry or why they\u2019d want to make them feel unwelcome in their church or to feel threatened in a bathroom\u2014I\u2019m going to loudly affirm their right to love and worship and urinate as they desire. Instead of trying crack the complex code that drives someone to persecute peaceful Muslims simply for pursuing their chosen faith tradition\u2014I\u2019m going to stand with Muslims and declare their inherent worth and the beauty of their spirituality. Rather than trying to help you process why saying \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d is such a hardship to you and the implications of your refusal\u2014I\u2019m going to go ahead and tell you that they matter to me. And so it isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t respect those doing these things, or that their hearts and their fears and their motivations and hurts don\u2019t matter\u2014believe me they do. It\u2019s just that right now, there are more urgent needs: rescuing imperiled people from the fruit of their bad decisions and the fallout of their malicious choices. In these moments, I\u2019m not really interested in whatever toxic cocktail of bad theology, fear, life experience, nationalism, and personality that have created their responses\u2014as I am helping people who are made vulnerable by their responses. I\u2019d like to uncover and care for the heart of the bully, but in this hour I need to defend the bodies and souls of the bullied. So with all due respect, if you\u2019re still supporting this hateful, reckless, malignant President, and still applauding and blessing the actions that cause incredible harm to millions of Americans\u2014I\u2019m not particularly interested in figuring out why you\u2019re doing that today. One day I will, but right now I\u2019d rather make sure people don\u2019t die because they get cancer, or commit suicide because they feel unloved, or are forced from a country they love and deserve to live in. Yes, if you support this President and the sickness he\u2019s spreading I\u2019d really like to one day understand you, but on behalf of those so endangered because of them\u2014first I want to stop the bleeding.","label":1}

{"text":"Wall Street Journal Reporter Asks Russia For \u201cClinton Information\u201d ----Turns Up DEAD 2 Days Later: Write a comment A Wall Street Journal Editor who was investigating how a Russian Pharmaceutical firm could have been purchased in 2014 by an American Pharmaceutical firm while Sanctions against Russia existed against such business transactions, has been found dead in his New York City apartment. The crux of the dead journalists investigation was how then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton influenced the transaction to be finalized, but only AFTER her husband Bill was paid $500,000 for giving a speech in Moscow. The Russia Consulate General\u2019s office in New York City was contacted by Wall Street Journal reporter\/editor Joseph Rago who requested a Thursday (20 July) in person interview with consular officials regarding an upcoming article he was preparing on Hillary Clinton and her links to Russia. Rago failed to attend the meeting and was later discovered dead in his apartment of as yet \u201cunknown causes\u201d just hours prior to this meeting occurring. Joseph Rago was a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter whose expertise was in the health care field. His stated purpose for this meeting was his investigating Hillary Clinton\u2019s links to the 2014 sale of Veropharm (one of Russia\u2019s largest medical companies) to the American medical giant Abbott Laboratories. Critical to note about Abbott Laboratories acquiring Veropharm, is that the deal was FINALIZED on December 12, 2014; 9 months AFTER Sanctions were imposed upon Russia. It may interest some to know that Russian sanctions could be \"Waived\" . . . . by the State Department, for instance! This takeover of Veropharm was structured to evade the Obama regime sanctions against Russia, and was accomplished by a US shell company named Kew Garden Hills, LLC -- registered in Delaware \u2013and-- Hillary Clinton\u2019s home State of New York -- acquiring approximately 98% of Veropharm shares\u2014and then that shell company, Kew Garden Hills, LLC, being bought by Abbott Laboratories. Interestingly, Kew Garden Hills, LLC, has no officer, directors, or even corporate information listed in the S ;P Global Market Intelligence database; a strange fact for a firm involved in a multi-billion dollar US\/foreign pharmaceutical acquisition. Here, check the S ;P Global Market Intelligence data for yourself. Handling this transaction, was the Russian investment bank Renaissance Capital \u2014 who are noted for their having paid former President Bill Clinton $500,000 for a speech he gave before their top executives in Moscow. Rago told Russian consular officials that he had documents linking Hillary Clinton to both Abbott Laboratories and Kew Garden Hills, so it was believed by them that this was the line of inquiry he was going to pursue during his requested meeting \u2014 which never took place because Rago turned up dead. The mysterious death of the 34-year-old Joseph Rago, follows by less than 2 weeks the \"suicide\" of another Hillary Clinton linked person named Renwick Haddow\u2014a top former Haitian government official who ended up with a bullet in his head just a week prior to his testifying against Hillary Clinton in a Miami, Florida, courtroom. These facts beg the question: Was Wall Street Journal Editor\/Reporter Joseph Rago killed to prevent publication of his Hillary Clinton-Russia story?

{"text":"Sebastian Gorka\u2019s Wife Helped Torpedo Funding For Anti-White Supremacist Group: News Via LobeLog A group working to deradicalize white supremacists had been set to receive funding from the Department of Homeland Security until Trump aide Katharine Gorka worked to eliminate its grant. Gorka, a homeland security official and the wife of controversial White House counterterrorism advisor Sebastian Gorka, was a member of President Trump\u2019s transition team before his inauguration. As the Forward reported in May, she met with Homeland Security officials in December and told them that Trump didn\u2019t agree with the Obama administration\u2019s approach to funding Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) programs. Shortly before he stepped down, Obama had awarded $400,000 to Life After Hate, which was founded by former white supremacists and works to help others renounce that ideology. It was the only group in a $10 million funding round focused exclusively on fighting white supremacist violence. But Trump and then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly ordered a freeze on all CVE funding, and when the department published a new list of CVE grant recipients in June, Life After Hate was no longer listed.

Mikhail Klimentyev \u2014 TASS via Getty Images When it comes to finding the source of last week\u2019s Democratic National Committee email leak, all signs point to Moscow being involved according to the nation\u2019s intelligence community. The New York Times reported Wednesday that American intelligence agencies have \u201chigh confidence\u201d Russia played a role in the latest WikiLeaks scandal that resulted in former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz announcing her resignation Sunday. Some of the thousands of leaked emails indicated DNC officials favored Hillary Clinton winning the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination over Bernie Sanders, adding furor to protests by Sanders supporters on the DNC floor in Philadelphia Monday night. One of the emails even outlined DNC CFO Brad Marshall\u2019s plan to attack the Vermont Senator\u2019s religious beliefs in key state primary races, proposing someone accuse the candidate of being an atheist rather than a man of Jewish faith. \u201cIt might may (sic) no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief.

CrowdStrike determined two Russian hacker groups named Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear had indeed breached the DNC\u2019s servers, one of which is believed to be run by the G.R.U., Russia\u2019s military intelligence service.

{"text":"Here Are 7 Ways to Fight Back Against Trump\u2019s War on Latinx Immigrants: Detainee talking to someone through a glass pane. But this isn\u2019t a distant country. This is the United States. And these horrors are happening every day to some of our most vulnerable victims \u2014 Latinx immigrants. A culture of contempt against Latinx people permeates not only mainstream culture but ICE agent culture under Trump as well \u2014 from racial profilingand hate crimes to midnight arrests and mass deportations of brown-skinned people. These acts are perpetrated against moms working multiple jobs, dads dropping their kids off at school, college students, and even kids on their way to the prom. People have faced hell to travel miles from South America, Central America, and Mexico, only to end up detained, dead, or deported in the so-called \u201cland of the free.\u201d In Trump\u2019s America, Latinx people are \u201cbad hombres\u201d and undocumented immigrants are \u201c criminals,\u201d no matter how law-abiding, tax-paying, or college-educated. No one is safe from being targeted \u2014 not families, mothers, college students, or even children. ICE is not concentrating on immigrants who have committed crimes, they are after everyone. And this is all courtesy of Trump and his administration\u2019s war on Latinx immigrants and other Latinx people caught in the crossfires. U.S. citizens and documented residents aren\u2019t safe either \u2014 not if they have brown skin. Hundreds of Latinx citizens have been detained for days, months, or even years. Davino Watson was held for more than three years. Rony Chavez Aguilar was in ICE custody without access to legal services and was being prepared for deportation for more than three weeks. This is Trump and his administration\u2019s wet dream come true \u2014 a repeat of Eisenhower\u2019s \u201cOperation Wetback,\u201d where any Mexican or Mexican-American who could not immediately prove citizenship was deported or simply dumped in the desert to die. It is an even bigger throwback to Hoover\u2019s \u201cMexican Repatriation\u201d of the 1930s, when up to 2 million Mexicans and Mexican-Americans were illegally deported. Approximately 60% of them were U.S. citizens. Since Trump took office, arrests of undocumented immigrants have soared nearly 40%. ICE literally can\u2019t deport people fast enough due to sheer volume and, of course, because there is a lot of money to be made in incarceration. This is part of what Trump meant by making America \u201cgreat\u201d again. This is on the spectrum of ethnic cleansing. This is Trump, Jeff Sessions, Steve Bannon, John Kelly, Tom Homan, and Stephen Miller wanting to make America not safer, but whiter. They want us to be afraid. This is a state of emergency. Mass deportations are happening now. Racial profiling and mass arrests are happening now. We are in a code red situation. We need all hands on deck to resist Trump\u2019s regime of terror.

{"text":"In To Kill A Mockingbird, what is a quote that proves that Tom Robinson was not involved in the murder because he is not left handed?: Tom Robinson could not have beaten up Mayella Ewell because he is crippled on his left side. Early in the trial, Atticus establishes that Mayella was attacked by a left handed person, and that Bob Ewell is indeed left handed.  Atticus was trying to show\u2026 that Mr. Ewell could have beaten up Mayella. \u2026If her right eye was blacked and she was beaten mostly on the right side of the face, it would tend to show that a left-handed person did it. (ch 17)  Scout is not impressed. She figures that Tom Robinson could just as easily be left handed, and then there is no reason for all of the fuss. After all, she is a child. She can follow most of the proceedings, but she does not see the bigger picture. We see that Tom Robinson is crippled when they try to swear him in and he can\u2019t keep his left hand on the Bible.  Thomas Robinson reached around, ran his fingers under his left arm and lifted it. He guided his arm to the Bible and his rubber-like left hand sought contact with the black binding. As he raised his right hand, the useless one slipped off the Bible and hit the clerk's table. (ch 19)  Tom could not possibly have attacked Mayella Ewell. Since Atticus went to so much trouble to demonstrate that she was attacked by a left handed person, it did not take much to get the jury\u2019s attention when they saw that Tom could not use his left hand. Unfortunately, being physically unable to commit the crime was not enough for the jury. It was still a black man\u2019s word against a white woman\u2019s. While Mayella is testifying that Tom Robinson assaulted and raped her, Atticus asks Mayella to identify her perpetrator. Scout recalls seeing Tom Robinson stand up for the first time and notices his obvious handicap. Scout says,  \"He looked oddly off balance, but it was not from the way he was standing. His left arm was fully twelve inches shorter than his right, and hung dead at his side. It ended in a small shriveled hand, and from as far away as the balcony I could see that it was no use to him.\" (Lee, 188)  The audience and the community of Maycomb know that Tom Robinson cannot use his left hand at all. The fact that Mayella was beaten predominately on the right side of her face indicates that the perpetrator lead almost exclusively with his left hand. Mayella also had bruises the entire way around her neck, which means that somebody with two good hands must have choked her. All of the circumstantial evidence suggests that Tom Robinson is innocent and that Mayella's father, instead, assaulted his daughter. During Atticus's closing remarks, he mentions that this case is as simple as black and white and explains Mayella's reasoning for accusing Tom Robinson of rape. Atticus then mentions the evidence which suggests that Bob Ewell assaulted his daughter, given the fact that he is left-handed and Tom Robinson is handicapped. Atticus tells the jury,  \"We don\u2019t know, but there is circumstantial evidence to indicate that Mayella Ewell was beaten savagely by someone who led almost exclusively with his left.\" (208) ","label":0}
{"text":"Parents sue San Diego schools over CAIR \u2018anti-Islamophobia\u2019 lessons: SAN DIEGO, Calif. \u2013 Numerous parents are suing the San Diego school district over an anti-Islamophobia campaign they believe is a \u201cpolitically correct solution to a problem that does not exist,\u201d attorney Charles LiMandri said. LiMandri represents six parents who sued the school district because they believe the campaign bestows special protections for Muslim students and favors their religion over others, the Associated Press reports. \u201cNo one is saying we have to have expensive, protracted litigation,\u201d LiMandri said. \u201cThere can be a more commonsense approach to this where all students can be protected and no students are being favored to the disadvantage of anyone else.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s our position that the anti-bullying policies should protect all students regardless of ethnicity and affiliation, and they shouldn\u2019t be singling out any religious group for special treatment, as they seem to be doing here,\u201d he said. The San Diego Unified School District\u2019s new plan to combat bullying of Muslim students, approved in a 4-0 vote in April, adds more lessons on Islam to the curriculum to foster \u201cunderstanding.\u201d Those lessons are created in collaboration with the Council of American-Islamic Relations, which LiMandri and parents believe is working \u201cto change American society and advance radical Islam,\u201d the attorney told the San Diego Union-Tribune. According to the AP: The multiyear plan includes ensuring staff calendars include Muslim holidays, reviewing library materials on Muslim culture, providing resources to teachers and engaging in partnerships with the Council on American Islamic Relations. The district also plans to consider high school clubs that promote American Muslim culture, create \u201csafe spaces\u201d for students and train staff about Muslim culture. The district is reviewing internal staff calendars to make sure Muslim holidays are recognized. The move to protect Muslim students stems in part from a CAIR report from 2015 that allegedly found more than half of California Muslim students have been bullied because of their religion. District data also showed seven bullying incidents between July 1 and Dec. 31, 2016, though data doesn\u2019t reveal which religions were targeted. \u201cThat\u2019s a relatively small number and it does not warrant or justify a wholesale change in the school district or its curriculum,\u201d said LiMandri, who filed the federal lawsuit last Tuesday. \u201cIt appears to us that this is a politically correct type of solution looking for a problem,\u201d he told the Union-Tribune. \u201cIf Muslim students are being bullied, stop the bullying. But you don\u2019t need to implement a program that is favoring Muslim students or one religion over another.\u201d SDUSD officials would not comment on the pending litigation, but have defended the special campaign to combat alleged Muslim bullying that they claim is \u201cpervasive and vastly underreported,\u201d according to the Times of San Diego. \u201cSan Diego Unified does not favor any religion over another,\u201d district director of family and community engagement Stan Anjan wrote in an email to the Union-Tribune in February. \u201cWe welcome all students from all faiths within our school community.\u201d The parents\u2019 lawsuit alleges the district is violating students\u2019 constitutional rights by favoring one religion over another, but does not seek monetary relief. Instead, LiMandri said parents want the district to ditch its affiliation with CAIR and work with parents to create an anti-bullying campaign that protects all students and isn\u2019t centered on specific religions.

{"text":"LIMBAUGH: &quot;It is the End of CNN&quot;: By Rush Limbaugh Hey, let me ask you a question, folks. How many people over the course of your life, over the course of the recent past, months, years, how many people do you know that constantly complain about the media? Everybody, right? Everybody\u2019s always complaining about the media. So over this past weekend I had somebody say, \u201cDo you believe what Trump is doing to CNN?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you mean what Trump is doing to CNN? It\u2019s not what Trump is doing to CNN. It\u2019s what CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post are doing to Trump!\u201d So many people have complained to me about the media for all of my life, the entire portion of my life that I\u2019ve been doing this program. \u201cSomething\u2019s got to be done. We\u2019ve got to do something. Why doesn\u2019t somebody do something about the media?\u201d And here comes Donald Trump doing something about the media and people are getting nervous. Not everybody. Some people are obviously very supportive and happy about this. I think it was last week or the week before, I forget which, but I openly stated on this program that we are witnessing the decline and eventual demise of CNN. And that statement was picked up by several in the Drive-By Media, and panels were assembled to discuss my premise. \u201cDo you really think,\u201d it was asked on Fox News, \u201cdo you really think this could be the end of CNN?\u201d It is the end of CNN.  My point about this, a lot of people are nervous. Trump supporters are nervous about the tweet. Not everybody, but some Trump supporters are nervous about the tweeting and they\u2019re nervous about him taking on CNN. For everybody who\u2019s wanted something done about the media, this is what it looks like. For everybody\u2019s who\u2019s complained about \u201cinside-the-Beltway-itis\u201d and how it happens and says we need to drain the swamp or whatever, this is what it looks like. It was never gonna be pretty. It was never going to appear rational or normal. I mean, this is a huge battle taking place that Donald Trump is waging single-handedly. Now, he\u2019s got his supporters out there, don\u2019t misunderstand. The social media army is out there supporting, and he\u2019s not alone in this. But in terms of electoral politics he pretty much is alone in this, and he continues to take it to them. And they clearly do not know how to deal with Trump. When I saw this, I was jealous. I was jealous that I didn\u2019t do this. The video of Trump body slamming a CNN logo. I said, \u201cThis is great.\u201d Trump didn\u2019t do it. He just retweeted it. But it was clever, it was funny, and it illustrated once again that modern-day journalism and modern-day liberalism have zero sense of humor. The serious outrage that this was met with is highly illustrative of just where modern-day liberalism is and who they really are. I mean, CNN literally went bat crazy over this. They were acting like this is a direct assault on all members of the media. This is promoting violence against the media. Meanwhile, the only people being shot out there are Republicans. The only people being shot are Republicans, and they are deranged supporters of liberals like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, and they are listening to all the rhetoric that the Drive-By Media, including CNN, is using to make them insane, to rev them up. Here comes a guy on our side of the aisle using clever satire and parody, putting the CNN logo over the face of Vince McMahon, a video tape of Trump at a Wrestlemania a long time ago, CNN logo. (laughing) CNN can\u2019t take it. CNN goes bonkers, claiming that this is going to cause violence against journalists. Meanwhile, the only violence taking place is against Republicans, and it is with guns, and it\u2019s being perpetrated by deranged followers of left-wing news such as CNN, the New York Times, the Huff and Puffing Post, you name it. I thought it was hilarious and funny. But it made some people nervous is my point. I saw a lot of people over the weekend and they said, \u201cIt\u2019s just not presidential.\u201d I said, \u201cLook, the problem is Trump didn\u2019t start this.\u201d And I reminded every one of these people how every time I\u2019ve talked to them over the years, at one point or another there\u2019s widespread complaining about the media. And there\u2019s always somebody in the group, \u201cSomebody\u2019s gotta do something.\u201d Well, somebody is. And this is what it looks like. This is exactly what it looks like, whether you\u2019re taking on the media or whether you\u2019re taking on any other branch of the Washington ruling class or establishment. I think while people are aware of the dislike and the unpopularity of establishmentarians of Donald Trump, I don\u2019t think people have a full-fledged correct understanding of the sheer, raw hatred for Trump that they have. And that kind of hatred that they are carrying with them every day is dangerous. It\u2019s destructive. It\u2019s distorting. It is almost dehumanizing in a way. Hat tip: Jeff Poor","label":1}

{"text":"YOU WANT LEAKS? Let\u2019s Give Them Leaks: The nonstop (and completely fraudulent) accusations leveled against the Donald Trump since his candidacy was announced have now reached a crescendo. We're more than 100 days in to the new administration and we're still waiting for evidence that a single person in the Trump camp \"colluded\" with the Russians on a topic more serious than the best brand of vodka. In fact, thanks to the liberal authors of the new bestseller Shattered, we now know that the Clinton camp invented the collusion tale to help explain their devastating loss. The media, despite the progressive provenance of the story, The New York Times and The Washington Post continue to publish coordinated leaks by \"unnamed sources\" intended to wound the president. Their efforts have set the Beltway establishment all atwitter. They sing a siren song of impeachment and criminal charges, twin aspirations as delusional as they are unachievable. Trump isn't going anywhere. Further, regular Americans are increasingly ignoring the fraudulent and unhinged complex of Democrat-and-government media kooks. It is, as Kurt Schlichter has described it, nothing less than a coup against elected government.  It is nice... to have liberals finally come out against the abuse of executive power, misuse of classified material, and Russians. Welcome to the party, except we know you\u2019re full of Schumer. It\u2019s all lies, and they know it and we know it. Normal people just shake their heads and wonder why Washington is so consumed with political nonsense instead of solving problems. But then, Washington does not produce solutions. It produces only political nonsense. This is a concentrated, coordinated effort by elite insiders to take down not this president \u2013 Trump\u2019s not the point here \u2013 but to take down us, the normal American they seek to rule. Someone came to Washington who wasn\u2019t part of the club, and that\u2019s intolerable. So they are desperate to expel him, and by extension, us. Every day will be a crisis, every action he takes will be the worst thing that has ever happened, and every step towards keeping his promises a crime.  There are a few ways, however, to fight back. And fight back hard, on multiple fronts: Patriots -- that is, people who believe in the American system of government who have access to the right information -- must start revealing the true scope and scale of the rampant scandals inflicted upon America by the Obama administration. From Hillary Clinton's illegal bathroom email server to Eric Holder's skulduggery, every day should bring a new revelation that can and will dominate headlines. There's no shortage of options. Carefully ignore the purveyors of fake news and anti-Trump hysteria, starting with The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN. Freeze them out. Don't retweet, link to, or even read the leading purveyors of #FakeNews. In short, it's time to fight fire with fire. Gentlemen, start your leaking!","label":1}
{"text":"SO MUCH FOR OBAMA\u2019S &quot;FLEXIBILITY&quot;: Missile Defense Working Despite Decades of Democrat Resistance:  Tuesday\u2019s missile defense test in which a ground-based interceptor successfully intercepted an ICBM over the Pacific was both a warning to North Korea and another indication America is back. The test was in the works before Trump took office but it comes under an administration welcoming improvements in missile defense versus the prior Obama administration that used back-channels to try to give it away to Putin and the Russians. As the Washington Examiner reported:  The U.S. Missile Defense Agency successfully shot down a dummy warhead in space over the Pacific Ocean Tuesday during a test of a missile defense system that would protect the country from intercontinental ballistic missiles like the ones being developed by North Korea. \"During the test, an ICBM-class target was launched from the Reagan Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands,\" said a statement from the agency. \"A ground-based interceptor was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, and its exo-atmospheric kill vehicle intercepted and destroyed the target in a direct collision.\"   The irony of the interceptor being launched from a facility with Ronald Reagan\u2019s name on it should escape no one. President Reagan dreamt of a multi-layered missile defense most derided as \u201cStar Wars\u201d. He dreamed of preventinig or deterring a nuclear attack, not merely avenging one. Perhaps he might have also had in mind the danger posed from rogue regimes such as North Korea and Iran. We see Reagan\u2019s legacy in the Aegis missile cruisers and destroyers that can be deploted in troubled wters around the globe. We see it in the THADD theater missile defense recently seployed to South Korea. All of this President Barack Hussein Obama opposed. Missile defense systems are systems which President Obama has long opposed as \u201cCold War\u201d weapons. Soon after taking office, President Obama scuttled plans for ground-based missile defense installations in Poland and the Czech Republic. When President Obama took office in January, 2009, sitting on his desk were President George W. Bush\u2019s plans for the deployment of ground-based missile interceptors, such as are deployed at Fort Greeely, Alaska, in Poland as well as missile defense radars in the Czech Republic, As Investor\u2019s Business Daily noted over a year ago, President Obama had other plans and his betrayal of our allies was ironically exquisite:  Yet within hours of Medvedev's election as president in 2008, the Russian announced that Moscow would deploy SS-26 missiles in his country's enclave of Kaliningrad situated between our NATO allies Poland and Lithuania. He wanted the U.S. to abandon plans to deploy missile interceptors in Poland and warning radars in the Czech Republic designed to counter a future threat from Iran. What did President Obama do? He caved in and notified the Poles in a midnight phone call on Sept. 17, 2009 \u2014 the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's invasion of Poland \u2014 that we were pulling the plug on that system due to Russian objections. Putin then watched in 2012 as Obama promised Medvedev at the Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, South Korea, that after his re-election he would have more \"flexibility\" to weaken missile defense, which would help him fulfill his dream of U.S. disarmament. Putin know full well Obama\u2019s weakness in responding to any foreign threat to U.S. interests and security. President Obama was the Neville Chamberlain of our time, promising \u201cpeace in our time\u201d as he invites war with weakness, apologies, and appeasement. It was he who colluded with the Russians to threaten American national security in the \u201cback channel\u201d conversation with Medvedev which fell victim to an open mic.  Thanks largely to President George W. Bush and his push to fulfill President Ronald Reagan\u2019s dream, the continental United States and overseas allies are protected against missile attack by 30 deployed long-range Ground Based Interceptors (GBI), 32 Navy ships armed with over 100 SM-3 IA interceptors, and two dozen advanced SM-3 IB interceptors, dozens of Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptors, and eight X-band missile defense radars deployed abroad. It was Obama who proved to be Russia\u2019s and Putin\u2019s lapdog. Trump may have the chance to fire a second shot heard around the world, securing America\u2019s freedom and very existence. When that pudgy little man-child gets his latest toy, just shoot that North Korean ICBM test down.

{"text":"According To Major What Is The Cause Of The Animals Problems: Expert Answers Old Major eloquently depicts the lot of animals. In chapter one, he says:  \"Now, comrades, what is the nature of this life of ours? Let us face it: our lives are miserable, laborious, and short. We are born, we are given just so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies, and those of us who are capable of it are forced to work to the last atom of our strength; and the very instant that our usefulness has come to an end we are slaughtered with hideous cruelty.\"  In chapter two we see what actually happens in the farm. It is a confirmation of Old Major's ranting about the evils of humans. Jones and his men confirm all that Old Major said.  \"June came and the hay was almost ready for cutting. On Midsummer\u2019s Eve, which was a Saturday, Mr. Jones went into Willingdon and got so drunk at the Red Lion that he did not come back till midday on Sunday. The men had milked the cows in the early morning and then had gone out rabbiting, without bothering to feed the animals. When Mr. Jones got back he immediately went to sleep on the drawing-room sofa with the News of the World over his face, so that when evening came, the animals were still unfed. At last they could stand it no longer.\"  After the philosophy called \"Animalism\" is formed, the animals point out that men are the only animal that only consumes and never brings forth anything. Here is what the animals say:  \"Man serves the interests of no creature except himself. And among us animals let there be perfect unity, perfect comradeship in the struggle. All men are enemies. All animals are comrades.\"  The problem, therefore, according to Old Major is that man is selfish and only uses the animals for his own gain without any consideration. According to Old Major, man is the source of all the animals' problems. The animals have to wait on man for care because man gives the animals food. Yet, the only reason man is able to prosper is that the animals provide him with milk, meat, and eggs. Old Major wants the animals in charge of their own destinies--he wants to eliminate the humans from the farm because they are parasites on the system. By allowing the animals to keep everything they produce, the farm will run more efficiently and humanely. Not only does Old Major not like humans, but he dislikes anything associated with humanity, such as sleeping in beds, walking on two legs, and drinking alcohol. By taking away all the traits of humanity from the farm, Old Major hopes to create a Utopia. The source of much of their troubles is of course Man and the fact that man makes them labor \"to the last atom of their strength,\" but it is in some ways not just man. It is the fact that they do not benefit from their great labor. They toil, as previous posters stated, until they have used up every last bit of their usefulness but they do not get to enjoy the fruits of that labor, man does. So the cause of their problems is the fact that Man profits from their work, he gets their eggs, their strength plows his fields, he eats the meat they grow on their bodies, etc. So once they are free of Man, \"the produce of [their] labour would be [their] own.","label":0}

{"text":"Columnist For Adelson-Owned Newspaper Blamed \u2018Muslim Terror\u2019 For Vegas Shooting: News Gage Skidmore A columnist for a newspaper owned by billionaire mega-donor Sheldon Adelson repeatedly alleged on Sunday and Monday that the mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas was perpetrated by Muslims\u2014even after the police denied any connection to international terrorist organizations. Wayne Allyn Root, a self-proclaimed \u201cJew turned evangelical Christian\u201d who was the the Libertarian Party\u2019s 2008 nominee for vice president, joined the Las Vegas Review-Journal shortly after it was purchased in 2015 by a mysterious unknown owner, who was eventually revealed to be Adelson. In the hours after the Vegas attack, which turned out to be the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, Root tweeted, \u201cThis is real thing. Clearly coordinated Muslim terror attack. PRAY for our Vegas police. PRAY for victims. VERY bad. Awful.\u201d (He also tweeted that sources were telling him that there were multiple shooters\u2014which turned out to be false.) Although ISIS claimed credit for the attack, local police said that gunman Stephen Paddock had no known ties to terror groups. But Root doubled down. \u201cMedia has not connected dots. TWO lone wolf Islamic terror attacks on same day in France  ; Canada. ISIS makes sense,\u201d he wrote. Laura Loomer, another Jewish journalist with ties to the alt-right, also tied Paddock\u2019s girlfriend, named by police as a \u201cwoman of interest,\u201d to Muslim terror. \u201cThere is still a connection to Islam. So don\u2019t rule that out yet. The woman of interest traveled to the Middle East in the past year,\u201d she wrote. The girlfriend, Marilou Danley, had traveled to Dubai.

{"text":"Harvey Weinstein\u2019s \u2018Casting Couch\u2019 Sexual Harrassment Was Never Ok: Within Harvey Weinstein\u2019s incoherent statement of apology in the New York Times Friday after he was accused of being a serial sexual harasser of women, among the clumsily misquoted Jay-Z lyrics was an implicit justification for his actions: \u201cI came of age in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different. That was the culture then.\u201d Indeed, some of the coverage on the Weinstein bombshell took this ball and ran with it. On NPR\u2019s Up First podcast this morning, Steve Inskeep mused, \u201cI hate to say it, it\u2019s almost, as described, almost stereotypical behavior for a studio executive, inviting women into a room or into a hotel room and saying \u2018I\u2019ll help with your career if you do certain things for me.\u2019\u201d \u201cWell, yeah, a lot of what people are talking about now is that notion of the casting couch and how there was almost this kind of romantic notion placed upon it for many years,\u201d Washington Post pop culture correspondent Elahe Izadi agreed. As a sex worker, I admire the resilience and nerve of actresses of years past who leveraged these sorts of casting couch sexual transactions into fame. But their savvy working of a system in which their options were severely limited didn\u2019t make that old system any less abusive. This appeal to the unspoken mores of old Hollywood \u2014 \u201cromantic\u201d or not \u2014 is no excuse for the sexual predation Weinstein is accused of. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with sex as exchange. If Weinstein had made an appointment with an escort, I wouldn\u2019t condemn him for that. Indeed, Weinstein had the cash and connections available to him to have hired an escort every evening of his life if he were so inclined; Hollywood has a thriving sex industry, according to reports in the news and from the many sex workers I know. But according to the many accusations against him, Weinstein, like many abusive and powerful men before him, didn\u2019t seem interested in making these sorts of deals with women on an even playing field. What seemed to arouse him was making no-win propositions to women who might not feel like they had a choice. An escort can refuse a prospective client if something doesn\u2019t feel right. She can negotiate her rate, and she leaves when the session is over. She is employed specifically for sex and those conditions are clear, whatever the legal fiction must be about being paid for time. Whatever her economic circumstance, even as a survival sex worker, she usually doesn\u2019t live under the sway of one client. But instead of choosing to have transactional sex under those sorts of more equitable conditions, Weinstein is accused of propositioning women clearly under his power \u2014 low-level assistants and struggling actresses and models. Embedded in these propositions was not only the offer on the table, but also the threat of what would happen to a woman who refused. \u201cHow do I get out of this room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein?\u201d said Ashley Judd, recalling her thoughts twenty years ago when Weinstein pressed a massage on her in his hotel room to the New York Times. And that\u2019s exactly it \u2014 Judd knew that alienating Weinstein and losing his backing were the economic stick behind the carrot of what Weinstein could do for her as an actress if she pleased him. Sex worker theorists often point out that the reason that sex work is not valued as work is because it falls under the rubric of women\u2019s care labor \u2014 things women are meant to do for free as a condition of being women. This was the logic behind pioneering sex worker advocate Margo St James and her organization COYOTE\u2019s early alliance with Wages for Housework in the 70s. Make no mistake, sex work is work \u2014 and as such, it should not be an unwritten contract stipulation of every employed woman\u2019s job. It should not be expected of a terrified, underpaid assistant locked in a hotel room with her naked studio exec boss demanding she give him a massage, worried that if she refuses she will lose her job. That stark imposition of power is rightly called sexual harassment. \u201cI am a 28 year old woman trying to make a living and a career,\u201d Lauren O\u2019Connor wrote in her searing memo. \u201cHarvey Weinstein is a 64 year old, world famous man and this is his company. The balance of power is me: 0, Harvey Weinstein: 10.\u201d Based on these reports, Weinstein felt entitled to the sexual labor of women like O\u2019Connor who were trying to make a living and a career. In the context of that vast power imbalance between him and the women he harassed, he felt entitled to demand it, wielding the implicit threat of firing or the socioeconomic Hollywood death of never eating lunch in his town again. His entitlement used to be the unwritten law of the land, and it still is, in many places. That\u2019s why many people \u2014 the same people who are aghast at the prospect of prostitution in conditions which are more explicit and autonomous \u2014 are still inclined to make excuses for Weinstein\u2019s misogyny. Sex workers often comment that at least in sex work they are paid cash on the dollar for what they are coerced into doing by many legitimate employers as a condition of simply securing their jobs. Thankfully, the Times story and Weinstein\u2019s abasement in the face of it demonstrates that many people are no longer so sanguine about sexual harassment, even the romantic Hollywood casting couch iteration of this sexual violence.

{"text":"\u201cUsher Went From Smashing Chilli to Smashing Pork N Beans\u201d: Twitter Clowns Woman Suing Usher for NOT Giving Her Herpes: Quantasia Sharpton is one of the latest people to sue Usher in the singer\u2019s growing herpes scandal. Along with her lawyer, Lisa Bloom, Sharpton shared details of her sexual encounter with Usher during a press conference in New York on Monday (Aug. 7). Sharpton says she attended an Usher concert for her 19th birthday and was invited backstage because of her birthday crown. A security guard then told her Usher was interested in her and asked for her number. After the show, she claims Usher called her from a blocked number and then asked if he could come to her hotel room. \u201cWe spoke for a while and then we engaged in sexual contact. He never warned me about any STDs,\u201d Sharpton claimed. But here\u2019s the gag: The 21-year-old says she DOES NOT have herpes. Sharpton is suing Usher because she feels her rights were violated as he knowingly put her health at risk without her consent. Twitter responded to Quantasia Sharpton\u2019s press conference and admitting she doesn\u2019t even have herpes with a major side eye.

{"text":"VIDEO: Racist Mother Demands Her Son Be Treated by a \u201cWhite Doctor Who Doesn\u2019t Have Brown Teeth\u201d: Video footage of a racist mother with a sick child has gone viral. Despite her son\u2019s needs, the white Canadian demanded her son only be treated by a white doctor, even though none were available at the time. An unidentified woman in Ontario brought her son complaining of chest pains to a walk-in clinic on Sunday (Jun. 18). However, after being approached by a non-white doctor, the woman demanded to see a white doctor who \u201cdoesn\u2019t have brown teeth and speaks English.\u201d  \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying, in the whole entire building there isn\u2019t one white doctor? You\u2019re telling me that my kid has chest pains and he\u2019s going to have to sit here until four o\u2019clock? Can I see a doctor that\u2019s white, that doesn\u2019t have brown teeth and speaks English?\u201d  \u201cGod, what type of horrible country do I live in?\u201d she complains after being repeatedly told the qualified doctors available don\u2019t fit her racist demands. Hitesh Bhardwaj, who immigrated from India to Canada five years ago, was disturbed by the comments and began recording the woman\u2019s outburst. The 4-minute long footage has gone viral and already amassed nearly 100,000 views.  Ha! Apparently ?? hasn't cornered the market on the craycray. #Canada \u2014 *Ms.* Covfefe to YOU (@Informed_Un) June 20, 2017   That kid is so embarrassed of his mother. She should be ashamed of herself. Sad shit \u2014 Dee (@wonderwomen_dee) June 20, 2017   Oh. Em. Gee. Someone needs an ass kicking. \u2014 Rhonda Stanton (@rhondarealtor) June 20, 2017   Love how y'all blurred this racist woman's face ? https:\/\/t.co\/h3SBmzGyYc \u2014 Matthew A. Cherry (@MatthewACherry) June 20, 2017  Some also waiting to be seen by a doctor could no longer stand the racist mother\u2019s comments. One \u201cbrave young girl,\u201d as Bhardwaj described her, confronted the woman.  \u201cYour child has more issues with you being his mother than him needing to see a doctor. You are extremely rude and racist. You want to talk about \u2018Paki\u2019 people being in a hospital? Maybe you should check yourself in.\u201d  Other agreed and also began to express their thoughts on the woman\u2019s racist behavior. The woman claimed they were calling her out because she\u2019s white.  \u201cYou\u2019re brown and you\u2019re attacking me because I\u2019m white. It\u2019s because I\u2019m white\u2026 Being white in this country\u2026 I should just shoot myself.\u201d  Throughout this ordeal, the mother\u2019s son continued to experience chest pains. She finally conceded that her son was \u201cpart not-white\u201d and said she would settle for a doctor who spoke English. The video ends. According to CTV News, the mother was eventually escorted out of the building after police were called to the clinic due to a \u201cdisturbance\u201d of a woman \u201cbeing verbally aggressive.\u201d Bhardwaj told CTV Toronto he was shocked by what he witnessed.  \u201cSeeing it so openly without any fear and in front of so many people, without even fearing that someone can report her, it was really shocking.\u201d  He added the incident bothered him for the rest of the day. \u201cIt was a mixed feeling of being angry and being frustrated.\u201d","label":0}
{"text":"Tunisia Overturns Ban Preventing Muslim Women From Marrying Non-Muslim Men: The right and freedom to marry, or not marry, the person of our choice is one of the most fundamental human rights today. Throughout history this has been a constant battle in a variety of different intersectional ways, and has also become an issue that can cause major divides. Whether it be the fight for marriage equality so that same-sex couples can enjoy the same legal benefits as heterosexual people, or the fight for interracial marriage which has put many people\u2019s livelihood at stake throughout history, especially here in the United States during segregation. But what about people of different religions getting married? One country has taken a major step forward for women\u2019s rights through marriage, allowing women the freedom of this important choice. Tunisia has just lifted a ban dating back to 1973 which forbade Muslim women from marrying non-Muslim men. As Al Jazeera reports, this ruling from the country\u2019s President Beji Caid Essebsi is part of his focus on furthering the rights of women across the country. \u201cThe state is obliged to achieve full equality between women and men and to ensure equal opportunities for all responsibilities,\u201d Essebsi said on Tunisia\u2019s National Women\u2019s Day in August. His office also released a statement about the decision, reiterating the importance of choice within marriage. \u201cCongratulations to the women of Tunisia for the enshrinement of the right to the freedom to choose one\u2019s spouse,\u201d presidency spokeswoman Saida Garrach wrote on Facebook. The 1973 ban was deemed unconstitutional, according to the new Tunisian Constitution drafted in 2014 in the wake of the Arab Spring, which outlines a number of equal rights for women which did not exist previously. President Essebsi formed a committee led by a female lawyer and human rights activists in order to draft new laws for Muslim women. Before the ban was overturned, in order for a Muslim woman to marry someone outside of Islam, the man would have to convert and provide a certificate as proof of his newly-adopted religion. But of course, as is the norm for many countries where laws fundamentally favor men as superior beings, Muslim men were always allowed to marry non-Muslim woman. Although the Tunisian constitution is said to have more rights for women, at least on paper, there are still areas which are lacking in equality. For instance, a daughter can only inherit half of what a son is entitled to. \u201cThe first president of independent Tunisia, Habib Bourguiba, championed a landmark social code in 1956 that set a standard for the region by banning polygamy and granting new rights to women unheard of in the Arab world at the time. But even he didn\u2019t dare push for equal inheritance,\u201d explained the Al Jazeera article. A number of the laws which disproportionately favor men over women are looked upon positively by some religious clerics, who disapprove of the President\u2019s decision to overturn the 1973 marriage ban. However, as the Washington Post reports, the religious backlash may not even be the most controversial or troubling aspect of President Essebsi\u2019s recent decisions. The day before the non-Muslim marriage ban being overturned, he passed a law that has left some human rights activists concerned about his larger agenda. \u201cTunisia\u2019s parliament passed a reconciliation law that seeks to protect civil servants from the old regime from prosecution under the country\u2019s Truth and Dignity Commission that is dealing with the legacy of the brutal dictatorship of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali that fell in 2011,\u201d writes WaPo\u2019s Paul Schemm. In the wake of the Arab Spring, Islamic leaders came to power initially, only to be voted out in 2014. After that, President Essebsi, who had held a number of positions in Parliament pre-revolution, came to power, promising prosperity and safety, as well as \u201creconciliation\u201d, which is now being seen in the form of giving businessmen and civil servants of the old regime that now were being tried for past crimes, including torture, bribery and embezzlement, exoneration. Amna Guellali from the Human Rights Watch said that the marriage ban being overturned in light of the reconciliation law was \u201cone step forward, one step back\u201d for Tunisia. \u201cFor a long time, the old regime used progress on women\u2019s rights as a fig leaf to distract from its repressive policies. By championing women\u2019s rights while at the same time expanding impunity for acts of corruption, the Tunisian government is reminding us of how these two contrasted realities worked in the past and how women\u2019s rights were used to whitewash a system riddled with corruption and systematic human rights violations,\u201d she wrote in a statement. With the ushering in of a new constitution and a new government in the wake of a major revolution like that of the Arab Spring, we are no doubt going to see a lot of progressive measures tempered by moves that are seemingly regressive, as is the reconciliation law. The struggle for power is never an easy one, and throughout history, around the world, we have seen how many movements have left certain groups behind or ignored others. For Tunisia to truly be a bastion of women\u2019s rights in the Middle East, equality cannot only be enshrined in legislation, it must be lived out in every sector of society. Back in July, Tunisia passed tougher lawson domestic and sexual violence as well as sexual harassment in public spaces. The new laws also closed a controversial loophole which granted rapists a reprieve if they married their victims. QZ.com reports women now make up a sizeable percentage of the Tunisian workforce, and 75 out of 217 Parliament members. But laws that allow corrupt leaders to retain power or escape consequences show how patriarchy and privilege must be demolished in order for equality and freedom to truly be a reality for everyone. For now, the ability for Muslim women to marry whomever they choose is good news.","label":0}

At a boisterous campaign rally in Trump-friendly West Virginia, Trump slammed the investigation as a \u201cfake story that is demeaning to all of us and most of all demeaning to our country and demeaning to our Constitution.\u201d He commented hours after news broke that Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the investigation, had empanelled a grand jury in the case. \u201cI just hope the final determination is a truly honest one, which is what the millions of people who gave us our big win in November deserve and what all Americans who want a better future want and deserve,\u201d Trump told thousands of cheering, sign-waving supporters packed into an arena in Huntington. Trump overwhelmingly won the state in the November election, partly due to his promises to revive a slumping coal industry. The president, who remains agitated over the investigation into allegations of co-ordination between his campaign associates and Russian government officials, said Democrats have a decision to make. \u201cThey can continue their obsession with the hoax or they can serve the interests of the American people,\u201d he said. Trump maintains there were no ties between his campaign and Russia and says no wrongdoing was committed. His frustration over the investigation peaked in recent weeks as he began attacking Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the investigation. Sessions, most recently a U.S. senator, was an early and ardent Trump supporter. \u201cMost people know there were no Russians in our campaign. There never were,\u201d he told the cheering crowd in West Virginia. \u201cWe didn\u2019t win because of Russia. We won because of you.\u201d Trump argued that Democrats are pushing the \u201ctotally made-up Russia story\u201d because \u201cthey have no message, no agenda and no vision.\u201d \u201cThe Russia story is a total fabrication.

{"text":"Could Grant\u2019s Tomb Be The Next Monument To Go \u2014 Over Anti-Semitism?: Statues of Confederate generals are being targeted for removal across the country as \u201chate symbols\u201d in the wake of the bloody white supremacist riots that rocked Charlottesville, Virginia. But in New York, a monument to an iconic Union Army leader and U.S. president is the latest lightning rod for controversy. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s alleged sin? Anti-Semitism. At a press conference early this week, a reporter with a local CBS station asked New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio if Grant\u2019s body should be removed or the monument removed over an infamous order he gave in the midst of the Civil War to expel Jews from a portion of the South. \u201cI wonder if you think that somebody who did that, given the large number of Jews who live in New York, should be buried here New York,\u201d the reporter asked. De Blasio, who has set up a panel to review statues in the city, said he did not know. But the City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, has said she supports a review of the future of the majestic tomb, which sits in Riverside Park overlooking the Hudson River near Columbia University. It\u2019s an unlikely controversy, as Jewish experts on Grant hold that he repented for the expulsion order and that in his term as president was a friend to the Jewish community. The leading expert on Grant\u2019s expulsion of the Jews, the Brandeis University professor Jonathan Sarna, is unequivocal on what he thinks should be done with Grant\u2019s Tomb: It should stay. Library of Congress \u201cWhen one studies the totality of Grant\u2019s life and actions, one discovers that he represents the fact that hatred can be overcome,\u201d said Sarna, who has written a book on the expulsion. \u201cGrant apologized for the order, and as president went out of his way to prove just how unprejudiced he had become,\u201d Sarna said. \u201cHe appointed more Jews to public office than all previous presidents; he became the first president to attend a synagogue dedication.\u201d Grant also intervened on behalf of Jews in Romania and Russia facing persecution, Sarna said. The expulsion order, which in theory covered parts of Kentucky, Mississipippi and Tennessee, was never fully put into effect. According to Sarna, only a few Jews were directly impacted. \u201cOne really sees Grant as a man who grew in every way over the course of his life and career, and at least arguably that is something we should celebrate, rather than faulting him for what he himself considered to be a great mistake,\u201d Sarna said. It\u2019s not at all clear that the city could remove Grant\u2019s Tomb, even if it were to decide to do so: The structure is owned by the National Parks Service, a federal agency. A spokeswoman for the mayor said that the panel of experts and community leaders to review the public monuments and symbols is still being put together. De Blasio announced earlier this week that the city will remove a plaque honoring Vichy French leader Philippe P\u00e9tain, who collaborated with the Nazis during War War II. Author","label":0}
{"text":"Build that wall to block illegal immigrants: America's immigration policy is in dire need of reformation. President Donald Trump is intending to improve our economy by reforming new immigration laws. One of his platforms is to build a modern wall between the U.S. Mexican border. His intention is not to thoroughly stop new immigrants from coming into our country but to control illegal immigrants from coming into the United States. This policy has had a lot of controversy in our country, but it is only intended to keep America safe and strengthen our country. Due to the abundance of illegal immigrants coming into the United States, it is becoming a burden on our taxpayers and our social services. The amount of money we spend on illegal immigrants can be used towards providing services for our legal citizens that are in need of help. The current fence that is built along the border is not enough protection against immigration, because there are still many immigrants who cross it illegally every day. With President Trump's proposal, it will hopefully improve border security and save taxpayers millions of dollars. It is time to put an end to illegal immigration and come to America legally.

(Jefferson Siegel\/The Daily News via AP, Pool)  Former congressman Anthony Weiner, center, and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, left, leave court, Wednesday, Sept. 13, 2017, in New York. Weiner and Abedin, have appeared before a New York City judge to ask for privacy in their divorce case. Their lawyers asked for parts of the case to be sealed because it involves visitation for their young child. (AP Photo\/Mary Altaffer) WASHINGTON (Sinclair Broadcast Group) \u2014 The U.S. Department of State has discovered 2,800 government documents belonging to Huma Abedin on the personal laptop of her estranged husband, former New York congressman Anthony Weiner, according to conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch. Abedin was deputy chief of staff to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Judicial Watch cites a lawsuit filed against the State Department as the source of the information. The nonprofit initially filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking all emails sent or received by Abedin via a non-official email address. When the State Department failed to respond, the group took it to court, and a judge ordered the documents released. \u201cThe State Department has identified approximately 2,800 work-related documents among the documents provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\u201d the State Department's court filing reads. Some records, the government warns, may be \"duplicative,\" or counted twice. The review and production is ongoing and is not expected to be completed until the end of 2017. Work-related documents belonging to Abedin were first discovered on Weiner's laptopduring an unrelated investigation of the former congressman for sending sexual text messages to an underage girl. Weiner was recently sentenced to 21 months in prisonin that case. The FBI has previously released hundreds of pages of documents detailing interviews with Clinton, her staff, and State Department personnel during its investigation of Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state. These records include summaries of interviews with FBI officials and employees of companies that were involved with servicing Clinton's server. Then-FBI Director James Comey concluded in July 2016 that there was not enough evidence to pursue criminal charges. This is far from the first time Judicial Watch has sought and obtained documents relating to Clinton's tenure as first lady and as secretary of state. The organization is also fighting for the release of drafts of an indictment against Clinton that was never filed over the Whitewater investigation in the 1990s. Justice Department attorneys have objected to that request because Clinton was ultimately not charged with a crime. ","label":0}
{"text":"\u2039 Infinity War: 8 Rumors That Are Likely To Happen (And 7 That Are Just Too Crazy): 6. TOO CRAZY: A NEW CAPTAIN AMERICA At the end of Captain America: Civil War, the Captain ditches his Vibranium shield and goes to Wakanda away from the U.S. government and United Nations. Many people have taken this to mean that he is no longer Captain America, and they are right. The Infinity War trailer shows us Steve Rogers seemingly looking like Nomad from the comics \u2014 no star-spangled shield at all. Some people have theorized that this means a new hero will take up the mantle of Captain America like in the comics (Falcon and Winter Soldier being the two primary candidates). We don\u2019t think this will happen as Marvel will want to honor the memory of Captain America and let him and the mantle itself go out in glory. Furthermore, Falcon and Bucky are still fugitives. 5. LIKELY TO HAPPEN: TWO AVENGER TEAMS When the Russo Brothers were considering how they were going to start Avengers: Infinity War, they said that they were going to do it by splitting the team. They did this early on in Phase 3 in Captain America: Civil War. In the end of that movie, Captain America and Iron Man went their separate ways, taking specific teams with them as well. Iron Man and his comrades operated as government-registered superheroes while Cap and his Secret Avengers went to Wakanda for sanctuary. When Infinity War takes place, we\u2019d bet that Iron Man will be primarily leading one team while Cap and Black Panther will lead the other. Keep in mind that we don\u2019t see any of Cap\u2019s Secret Avengers interacting with Iron Man\u2019s team (save for that Scarlet Witch and Vision romance). This would also lead to them getting their butts kicked by Thanos, because they\u2019re fighting him while divided. 4. TOO CRAZY: THE CANCERVERSE IN THE MCU The Cancerverse was an interesting part of the Multiverse in the comics. Featuring darker versions of our classic heroes, it played a major role in the \u201cThanos Imperative\u201d storyline, where the Mad Titan had to work alongside a group of heroes that despise him: The Guardians of the Galaxy. The reason we highly doubt the Cancerverse will make an appearance in the MCU is that it will be a concept admittedly difficult for general audiences to understand. On top of that, it would unnecessarily complicate an already big film. With all those characters, Marvel has to keep Avengers: Infinity War as simple as possible to allow every hero the right time to shine on the big screen. That alone will take up a lot of the movie. 3. LIKELY TO HAPPEN: XANDAR\u2019S DESTRUCTION If you remember back to Guardians of the Galaxy, the central conflict of that film involved the Orb which was actually the Power Gem. After the Guardians managed to get it back from Ronan the Accuser, it was given to the Nova Corps to be faithfully protected deep within the vault of Xandar. In the Infinity War trailer, we see a shot of Thanos having both the Space and Power Gems in the Infinity Gauntlet. This means that he had to have gone to Xandar to steal the Gem from the Nova Corps. Considering the fact that Thanos isn\u2019t exactly a diplomatic guy, he went into the planet guns blazing and burnt it to a crisp just to get his precious Infinity Stone. That may even be the event that tips off the Guardians to join the fight. 2. TOO CRAZY: HEIMDALL WITH THE SOUL STONE There was a big theory going around regarding the MCU and the Infinity Stones. Each letter of \u201cThanos\u201d stood for what contained each stone. T-Tesseract, A-Aether, N-Necklace, O-Orb, S-Scepter. You might notice that the \u201cH\u201d is undetermined at this point. Many people have speculated that the \u201cH\u201d stands for Heimdall and that he contains the last stone. Why we\u2019re not on board with this one is that there\u2019s never been a whole lot of evidence to support this, including the Infinity War trailer. Instead, we think that the last stone is hidden in Wakanda somewhere. Why else would Black Panther have to engage all defenses and fight against the Mad Titan\u2019s army of monsters? To be fair, we also haven\u2019t had the Black Panther movie come out yet, so there\u2019s still time for the MCU to reveal a stone hiding in Wakanda. 1. LIKELY TO HAPPEN: SCARLET WITCH TRAINED BY DOCTOR STRANGE Doctor Strange, as the Sorcerer Supreme and the omnipotent guardian of Earth, has been rumored to be the one that brings the Avengers together to fight Thanos. There are a lot of shots of him in the trailer to support this theory. However, that\u2019s not the only contribution he is said to have among the team. There is a rumor floating around that he will meet Scarlet Witch. After seeing her instability and how that translates into her powers, he will train her to control her abilities and master them. While they\u2019re not exactly the same kind of magic-users, it\u2019d be a great scene of pure comic book fun to see these two interacting and learning from each other. It\u2019s funny to think that Strange would be training Scarlet Witch considering that she got her powers before he did. Which of these do you hope actually happens?

On Capitol Hill, Baldwin is finding agreement with Trump - if only on the fine point of \"buy America.\" Back in September, the Senate voted in favor a bill aimed to upgrade failing water systems. Baldwin included a measure requiring American made steel and iron be used on the taxpayer-funded projects. The move would benefit companies like Neenah Foundry and its workers. But Baldwin says a conflict arose last week. \"Speaker (Paul) Ryan and House Republicans removed the provision from the water resources Development Act,\" said Baldwin. \"It's just untenable. Stripping this 'buy America' reform I put in on the Senate side is only a giveaway, in my opinion, to foreign companies - Chinese and Russian steel producers - when we're expending taxpayer dollars.\" The water infrastructure problems took center stage during the presidential campaigns in Flint, Michigan, where lead pipes led to contaminated drinking water. Similar problems were also detected in other cities, including Green Bay. Critics say directing federal funds to some companies over others would be unfair. Ryan's office tells FOX 11 the \"buy America\" measure remains a \"materials requirement\" for certain federally-funded projects. Baldwin and other Democrats sent House leaders a letter pleading to keep the \"buy America\" requirement from the Senate bill intact for the House to vote on. Baldwin and others even turned to Twitter to try and get Trump to stand by his word. \"He should not be silent this week as we're fighting to restore this \"buy America\" reform. So far, no tweet from Trump. The House has yet to vote on the measure.","label":0}
{"text":"Alt-Right Jew: Charlottesville Was A Wake-Up Call: Getty Images Even after Charlottesville, I still don\u2019t know what to think of Richard Spencer. It\u2019s Saturday night and I\u2019m watching him compare his movement to Zionism on Israeli TV. He\u2019s wearing a nice shirt and I\u2019m not surprised; the man has fine taste in clothing, especially in vests. I\u2019d challenge anyone to name a public figure who pulls off vests better than Richard Spencer. As Jewish people, we can make psychic space for the rough anti-Semite, the uneducated man who hates us because he knows no better, the man in ripped jeans and rebel flag shirts. The \u201cnerdy Nazis\u201d with their polos, marching in Charlottesville can also be explained away, categorized, rendered less frightening. But a man who knows his vests? A man with a winning smile? This is an intrusion, a sign that the containment of the anti-Semitic virus has failed, that the good, the educated, the nuanced people of this world can no longer be assumed to be safe. No matter, though. I still tell people Richard is no Jew-hater. It\u2019s impossible for a real anti-Semite to be so objective about Zionism, to go on Israeli TV\u2026 and to wear those nice vests. No one, however, really cares. After Charlottesville, all nuance is lost. I can\u2019t blame my fellow Jews. The video, pictures and stories are awful. Hundreds chanting \u201cJews will not replace us,\u201d Nazi flags, the synagogue threatened. However Spencer feels about Jews, he will now attract genuine anti-Semites, moreso than before, and more of his events will devolve into this. Is this what he wanted? We must be honest about Charlottesville. No one was there to help us. The police in Charlottesville refused to watch the synagogue, despite specific threats (they later denied this). Antifa, claiming that they mobilized to \u201cprotect the community,\u201d did nothing to protect the Jewish community. Jews in Charlottesville had to rely on hired guns. Where were the \u201canti-fascists\u201d we hear so much about? Where were the police? It seems we can only rely on ourselves. Jews still thinking the left has any interest in defending us against Nazis are fools. I\u2019ve warned for quite awhile that the left will start seeing Jews as White, and the hatred and derision they pour upon white people is headed our way. There are countless vigils, teach-ins, Facebook posts from the left about Charlottesville and Nazis; few mention Jews. We feel this in our online spaces. Jews are an afterthought on social justice Twitter, an annoyance on leftist Facebook. Our concerns \u201cget in the way\u201d of the far more important issues for \u201cpeople of color\u201d \u2014 which of course we are not. I try to explain all of this to the Jewish race-warriors: turn our public discourse into race shaming, my peeps, and Jews will pay the price. We will always be the wrong race, under any formulation. Again, no one much cares anymore. Now I\u2019m watching news from the Boston \u201cFree Speech Rally.\u201d Not many people showed up. They ended up surrounded by something like 40,000 people thinking \u201cNazis\u201d had arrived. I watched antifa protesters attack a woman holding an American flag. I watched a Jewish Trump supporter draped in an Israeli flag, being followed and threatened. The mob acts like this is a fair fight, some kind of accomplishment. \u201cWe\u2019ve made these people crazy,\u201d I think to myself. Dark clouds approach on my mental horizon. Will the left ever be sane again? It\u2019s not just the left, though. Public discourse is breaking down. In a liberal-verging-on-activist-left echo chamber, all nuance is lost. Antifa, a group that has for months targeted random people, destroyed property, and insulted a disabled veteran, is compared to allied soldiers in WWII. President Donald Trump is \u201ccalled out\u201d for refusing to condemn \u201cWhite Supremacists\u201d \u2014 and when he does, faced with even more indignation over pointing out Antifa\u2019s violence. Some of the rhetoric is truly disgusting. Mollie Hemmingway, Senior Editor at The Federalist, posted this tweet regarding Charlottesville:  The argument Trump was wrong to point out problems of violent leftist mobs is better made if you don\u2019t endorse violent leftist mobs.\u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) August 16, 2017  Seems reasonable, right? Not to Marc Caputo of Politico, who responded with this gem:  Der St\u00fcrmer Mollie is on the same page as David Duke. https:\/\/t.co\/JwQTkgopZ4\u2014 Marc Caputo (@MarcACaputo) August 16, 2017  Oh yes, folks. David Duke. Der St\u00fcrmer. It\u2019s worth noting that Caputo is not a recent college graduate \u2014 he\u2019s a longtime reporter who has spent many years spent covering the Florida political scene. In this media environment, how is reasoned discussion even possible? We\u2019re all reacting to something that wasn\u2019t said, people who aren\u2019t there. Mollie Hemmingway doesn\u2019t have anything to do with David Duke or Der Sturmer, not even tangentially. So what? Marc isn\u2019t responding to her. When thousands of people show up to beat up \u201cNazis\u201d in Boston, there are no Nazis to beat up. So what? Someone has to be beat, so they just make-believe. A week ago I was talking to some of the local Jewish wheels. They want to know how to handle these times. My advice? \u201cBuy several of the same kind of semiautomatic rifle, that way you have barter items and spare parts.\u201d A woman started crying. \u201cBe sure,\u201d I continued, \u201cthat if you operate a Jewish school, no one looking at the playground can see the children.\u201d Jew-haters are especially set off by watching happy Jewish children. It\u2019s now early Sunday morning, long before the sun rises, and I\u2019ve got candles lit because it feels right. I stare into the flames. So much has changed since the days of the campaign. Where did the fun go? Where\u2019s the energy? What happened to the grand coalition of the disaffected? We voted for Trump because we knew those in power didn\u2019t want us to. We sent a message, and now the message is gone. No one will listen to reason anymore. Antifa doesn\u2019t care, Nazis don\u2019t care, the media doesn\u2019t care. I\u2019m not a prophet and I don\u2019t hear the voice of God, yet I can\u2019t help but imagine Him looking down on us: \u201cYou put politics before Me, this is your God now, this is what you wanted.\u201d I wrap my arms and head. No, this isn\u2019t what we wanted. Never again, dear Lord, my King. I will not forget you again.

{"text":"ESPN: NFL owners considering rule change to require players to stand for national anthem: Members of the San Francisco 49ers kneel during the national anthem as others stand prior to an NFL football game against the Arizona Cardinals, Sunday, Oct. 1, 2017, in Glendale, Ariz. (AP Photo\/Matt York) WASHINGTON ( WJLA) - The NFL is reportedly considering requiring its players to stand during the national anthem after weeks of protests from players around the league. ESPN says it recovered a letter allegedly sent by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to NFL teams on Tuesday. \"Like many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem,\" Goodell says in the letter. \"It is an important moment in our game. We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us. We also care deeply about our players and respect their opinions and concerns about critical social issues. The controversy over the Anthem is a barrier to having honest conversations and making real progress on the underlying issues. We need to move past this controversy, and we want to do that together with our players.\" The full letter can be read below. The act of players demonstrating during the anthem started in the 2016 preseason when then San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat during the anthem as a protest of police discrimination against people of color. Kaepernick then began kneeling during the anthem as the season progressed. Other players followed his example, either kneeling, sitting or raising a fist during the song. These actions drew criticism from those who deemed the players' actions unpatriotic or disrespectful. The movement has grown even larger in 2017 after President Donald Trump proposed firing any players who kneeled during the anthem. Some fans have said they will no longer watch NFL games if the protests continue and on Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence left a game between the Indianapolis Colts and 49ers after multiple 49ers players took a knee. Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones made headlines when he said that his players will not play if they disrespect the flag. \"There is no room here if it comes between looking non-supportive of our players and of each other or creating the impression that you're disrespecting the flag, we will be non-supportive of each other,\" Jones said, according to The Associated Press. \"We will not disrespect the flag.\"","label":0}

{"text":"Bill Clinton details Clinton Foundation overhaul if Hillary wins: Former President Bill Clinton announced Monday that he would step down from the foundation bearing his name if Hillary Clinton is elected president. In an open letter, the former president laid out the changes the Clinton Foundation and related initiatives would undergo should his wife, the Democratic nominee, become president to eliminate \u201clegitimate concerns about potential conflicts of interest.\u201d Among the changes that will be made should Hillary Clinton take the White House, the foundation will only accept donations from U.S. citizens, permanent residents and U.S.-based independent foundations. Foreign governments and corporations would no longer be able to donate. The changes come as Clinton continues to face political attacks on the foundation, and on whether such a large outside organization can co-exist while being run by the family of a major public official. The changes were announced on the same day that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called for the foundation to be entirely disbanded, saying it was the \u201cmost corrupt enterprise in political history.\u201d But in announcing the potential changes, Bill Clinton also launched a spirited defense of the foundation\u2019s work across the globe. He noted that broad progress on the environment, education and public health had been made, including millions of people getting access to affordable drugs to fight HIV thanks to the Clinton Health Access Initiative \u2014 covering more than half of the adults under treatment today. And he dismissed suggestions that the foundation should be shuttered if Hillary Clinton becomes president. \u201cWhile my role in that work will change, the work itself should continue because so many people are committed to it and so many more are relying on it,\u201d he wrote. Bill Clinton announced that he would step down from the foundation\u2019s board and stop fundraising for the organization if his wife is elected. And the foundation will be renamed, from the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation to simply the Clinton Foundation. Furthermore, he said the foundation would begin transitioning some of its international work \u2014 much of which relies on bilateral aid programs from foreign governments \u2014 to other organizations that are not government-run. The Clinton Global Initiative, which Bill Clinton founded in 2005 to gather global leaders from government and the private sector to tackle broad issues, would no longer meet following its September meeting. The foundation indicated it would be overhauling operations if Hillary Clinton were to become president earlier this month.","label":0}

{"text":"Christians: Privileged or persecuted?: According to a seminar at George Washington University, I\u2019ve been getting \u201cChristian Privilege\u201d all my life! That\u2019s on top of my patriarchal, white, gluten\/peanut tolerating privilege! But is that really true? Or is it one of those #FirstWorldProblems things? Globally, the idea of Christian privilege is pure sophistry. Christians are the recipients of up to 80 percent of religious persecution around the planet, making it the most persecuted religion in the world. Worldwide, Christianity is the opposite of privileged unless you consider it a privilege that the day your faith is discovered in Somalia is the day you die. \u201cBut we\u2019re just talking about the evil empire \u2013 the United States, David.\u201d OK \u2013 let\u2019s consider that. Christians in the United States don\u2019t blow people up; they don\u2019t riot in the streets; they do billions of dollars of good work. But they are still persecuted. Examples: Facebook refused an ad from a Catholic University because it was too violent \u2013 it pictured a statue of Jesus on the cross. Obama tried to force Hobby Lobby and The Little Sisters of the Poor to fund abortifacients against their Christian belief. Horrible people those \u201cLittle Sisters\u201d \u2013 caring for the elderly poor and destitute as if they were family. In 2012, Chick-fil-A owner Truett Cathy said he supports biblical marriage: one man\/one woman. The mainstream media went ballistic, and his restaurants were vandalized and received threats of violence from homosexual groups. A case is currently before the Supreme Court regarding a baker. The baker will sell homosexuals cupcakes, cakes and brownies, but, believing that same-sex marriage is a sin, won\u2019t bake cakes for their marriage ceremonies. So Colorado is trying to force him to violate his religious beliefs. None of that sounds \u201cprivileged\u201d to me. One could argue that Islam is much more privileged that Christianity these days. After 9\/11, when Muslim terrorists killed 3,000 Americans, U.S. leaders went to GREAT PAINS to distance Islam from those guys who claimed to kill in the name of Islam. After 9\/11: We were told we must watch out for \u201cIslamophobia.\u201d \u201cPhobia\u201d refers to an irrational fear \u2013 like the fear that one of the 100 million Muslims sympathetic to terrorism might fly a plane into a building in the name of their religion. Crazy. George W. Bush, confronted with this act of terror, declared, \u201cIslam means peace.\u201d Wrong. Who advised this guy? It\u2019s not a secret \u2013 Islam literally means, \u201csubmission.\u201d I guess \u201cpeace\u201d sounded better. Both Bush and Obama refused to say the term, \u201cradical Islam.\u201d It\u2019s not radical Christianity (they handle snakes) or radical Krishnas (used to accost you with love and bald heads in airports) or radical Girl Scout cookie pushers that are the problem. Obama invited dozens of real Islamic terror suspects to the White House. Obama criticized Christianity for the Crusade, which happened 1,000 years ago, but never criticized Islam for the terror of today. Trump banned travel from seven of 50 Muslim majority countries (they were terror incubators); the mainstream media was apoplectic calling it a \u201cMuslim Travel Ban.\u201d Weakest ban in history since it left out 43 countries. \u201cAll Muslims are BANNED. Except for 86 percent of them. But it\u2019s BIG BEAUTIFUL BAN.\u201d Bottom line? Islamic terrorists kill 3,000 Americans, and everyone runs around making sure no one offends Islam. Faithful Christians refuse to pay for abortion drugs or believe in biblical marriage, and they are the Taliban and must be destroyed! So in one sense in 2018, anyone that goes around claiming Christians have special \u201cprivilege\u201d is cloistered from reality. But, I must admit, here in the U.S., every person is a recipient of a specific type of Christian privilege. Here\u2019s the truth. The United States is: the greatest country in the world, the safest country in the world, the most prosperous country in the world, the most secure country in the world, and the freest country in all of history. Why? Because of the Christian values and principles that informed its founding and governance. Christian values led to the forming of a country unlike any in history \u2013 dedicated to protecting the individual\u2019s right to freedom and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. \u201cBut what about all the atrocities the U.S. has committed?\u201d America has her flaws, but those flaws exist in spite of Christianity, when the U.S. has not fully embraced Christian values. And we work hard to right the wrongs: Slavery was the norm around the world, and we were the only nation in human history to fight a bloody civil war to end it. In every election cycle, Barbra Streisand and her buddies declare they will leave the country if the conservative or Christian or Republican wins. And we wait, and we wait, but THEY NEVER LEAVE. THEY PROMISED! WHY WON\u2019T THEY LEAVE? Because there\u2019s nowhere better to go. Instead of \u201cChristian privilege\u201d seminars, there ought to be seminars everywhere on how you should thank your lucky stars if you\u2019re an atheist, your lucky charms if you\u2019re a witch, or whoever it is you worship, that you live in a country that was founded by Christians and\/or those who respected Christianity and the Bible.

{"text":"Conservatives Aren't Happy About Facebook's Plan To Fight Fake News: Here's Why: The widespread distribution of fake news on Facebook can be attributed to misinformed social media users who are eager to share news that will help support their cause. Facebook has been under fire in recent weeks for allowing these fake news stories to be shared on its platform. In response to the flak, the social media company released a statement that it will be rolling out new features to help stop the propagation of fake news, by making it easier for users to report a news article as fake, and by engaging the help of third-party fact-checkers. Some of the organizations that have been enlisted to help are ABC News, Snopes, and PolitiFact, which all belong to the International Fact-Checking Network led by Poynter. The effort to weed out fake news has been met with a positive reaction by most people. Any news story could be reviewed for accuracy and will be disputed if it is unsubstantiated. Once a user attempts to share a fake story, Facebook will send out a prompt that the story is being disputed. Disputed stories will also be affected by Facebook's new algorithm and will be placed lower in the News Feed. How Republicans, Conservatives Are Reacting Not everyone is happy, though. Conservatives are concerned that the news organizations that have been tapped by Poynter are leaning to the left. In an article published in the Daily Wire, editor-in-chief Ben Shapiro said that partnering with these news organizations is \"a disaster for news coverage. It's an attempt to restore gatekeepers who have a bias as the ultimate arbiters of truth.\" \"If these organizations begin questioning articles and penalizing outlets for simple political disagreements rather than outright factual falsities, conservatives will have to go elsewhere for their news,\" Shapiro added. The Daily Caller also criticized this decision and called one of the fact-checkers, Snopes, an \"unreliable liberal fact-checker.\" It also accused liberal journalists of branding legitimate conservative news agencies as producers of fake news. Paul Joseph Watson, a popular conservative political commentator, called the movement \"a group of incredibly biased left-wing fake news outlets that will bury dissenting opinions.\" Facebook's move regarding the proliferation of fake news on the site came up after observers noted that this phenomenon may have swayed a number of people into voting for President-elect Donald Trump. Accusations of fake news have been used by both sides of the political spectrum, with some people arguing that a particular news is fake just because it does not agree with what they believe in.","label":0}

{"text":"What The Facebook Search Warrant Means For Mueller\u2019s Russia Probe: It\u2019s not surprising that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is interested in the role Facebook played in Russia\u2019s campaign to influence the 2016 election. Yet, the news that broke over the weekend that his team had obtained a search warrant to access information about Facebook\u2019s recently disclosed Russia-linked ad spending is the clearest sign yet of the breadth of his probe, the pace at which its moving along and what kind of case he might be trying to build, regardless of whether he ultimately brings criminal charges. \u201cThis is not a wild goose chase, it\u2019s not just a fishing expedition. [It shows] that there is good reason to be believe that someone committed criminal behavior, we just don\u2019t know who that was and exactly what the behavior was,\u201d Laurie Levenson, a Loyola Law School professor and former federal prosecutor, told TPM. \u201cGiven the recent revelations, it\u2019s hard to keep calling this a witch hunt,\u201d she later added. That Mueller had sought a search warrant for information about Russia ad buys on Facebook was alluded to first in a Wall Street Journal reportFriday evening, and confirmed by CNN on Saturday. Getting a search warrant is a higher bar for Mueller to clear than a grand jury subpoena, another tool Mueller is using to obtain documents and testimony. \u201cTo get a search warrant like that, you have to show a judge that there is probable cause that evidence of a crime will be found at the location,\u201d said Harvard Law professor and former federal prosecutor Alex Whiting. \u201cThe fact that they got a search warrant shows that the investigation is moving forward and that they have found some evidence of crimes.\u201d Furthermore, former federal investigators tell TPM that it\u2019s likely that the warrant Mueller obtained is tailored and focused in a way only possible if you have a good idea of what you think you\u2019ll find. \u201cIt has to be particularly described, what he is looking for,\u201d said Asha Rangappa, who was a counter-intelligence agent for the FBI and now a Yale Law School professor. \u201cA judge isn\u2019t going to sign off some sort of blanket warrant that tells Facebook to turn over everything.\u201d Facebook admitted in a blog post earlier this month, before the revelation of a Mueller search warrant, that it had identified $100,000 in spending on about 3,000 ads purchased by 470 \u201cinauthentic\u201d accounts \u201clikely operated out of Russia.\u201d It wasn\u2019t clear exactly what prompted Facebook, which is notoriously secretive about its internal operations, to come clean on what it found. Congressional investigators running their own Russia probes have since signaled their interest in what Facebook has learned about Russia\u2019s involvement in politically-tinged Facebook posts. A search warrant, however, would oblige Facebook to be responsive to Mueller in a way a voluntary request does not. \u201cFor Facebook, voluntarily turning over the information may not be the approach they want to take because their image is, \u2018We trying to protect privacy of people\u2019s information,'\u201d Levenson said. \u201cA subpoena could be used, but I think in this situation the message their trying to send to the Facebook customers is, \u2018We follow the law, but we\u2019re not voluntarily turning over your information.\u2019\u201d A question that has emerged since Facebook publicly admitted the presence of the accounts is whether the social media platform was the site of any criminal election law violations. Foreign nationals are prohibited from making political contributions \u2014 including money as well as other things \u201cof value\u201d \u2014 in U.S. elections. It is also illegal to aid and abet a foreign national\u2019s contributions to a campaign. A question for Mueller\u2019s team is who was behind the Facebook campaigns and whether the Facebook activity qualifies as a contribution \u201cof value\u201d under federal election law. Mueller also appears to be interested what sort of criteria was used by the ad purchasers in targeting the content, the Wall Street Journal reported. According to Rangappa, even some of the most sophisticated foreign intelligence operations may be unfamiliar with the nuances of American politics. \u201cIf the targeted criteria was so specific that they would really need someone who would know American culture and campaigns to help them, who would that person be? Who would have that knowledge?\u201d Rangappa said. However, legal experts caution that a search warrant is by no means a predictor that the Mueller probe is heading towards an indictment. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t meant that they have found evidence of crimes committed by Americans \u2014 it could be crimes committed by Russians\u2014and it doesn\u2019t mean that somebody may be charged with a crime,\u201d Whiting said. \u201cSome of these investigative moves, might be consequential and might be really leading to something, and some may be more crossing off less promising leads but making sure everything is chased down,\u201d he added.","label":0}
{"text":"Trump, Pence, the Flag and Everyone Gets Hurt: It seems there\u2019s no end to the public debate we can have about the relative weight of racism and authoritarianism that go into driving Donald Trump vs mere ego and narcissism, a grinding maw of appetite and self-gratification. Of course, we don\u2019t really have to decide. It\u2019s both. But today\u2019s stunt does give us some reminder of the true pecking order. Mike Pence travelled to Indianapolis today to watch the Colts play the San Francisco 49ers with the pretty clear knowledge that at least some 49ers players would take a knee in silent protest during the national anthem. (The 49ers are Colin Kaepernick\u2019s old team.) After some did, Pence made a great show of walking out on the game and tweeting out his outrage at the players and commitment to the flag, America, the anthem, soldiers and unity. The Vice President\u2019s press office followed up with this statement \u2026  I left today\u2019s Colts game because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem. At a time when so many Americans are inspiring our nation with their courage, resolve, and resilience, now, more than ever, we should rally around our Flag and everything that unites us. While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem. I stand with President Trump, I stand with our soldiers, and I will always stand for our Flag and our National Anthem.  The pretty transparent upshot of all this was that the White House feels it needs to keep the \u2018ungrateful black players won\u2019t honor our flag or our military\u2019 storyline going for yet another week. (Pence flew last night from Las Vegas to Indianapolis for this and is about to fly back to California for a fundraiser, a whole almost cross country trip just to make this stunt possible.) It is conspicuous how Pence preaches the need for national unity while he and the White House continue transparently to exploit what they believe is the political value of heightening division. But even here, Trump couldn\u2019t help but jumping in to make clear that he told Pence to do this, relishing stamping Pence as the toady he no doubt is.  I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2017  If you were to plot it as story dialog it reads \u2026 Pence: I took this step based on my firm conviction \u2026 Trump: I told my boy Pence to do this. It\u2019s such classic Trump it\u2019s reminiscent of this iconic moment from the NATO summit. Admittedly, for Pence it serves as a minor cosmic justice. It reminds us what we already know. In Trumpland, everyone gets hurt. No one emerges with any dignity intact. He\u2019s that ravening maw of ego and appetite and above all else unquenchable need and he has the country by the throat.","label":1}
{"text":"Trump Unloads At Freewheeling Alabama Campaign Rally For \u2018Big Luther\u2019 Strange: Ostensibly in Alabama to boost the campaign of Sen. Luther Strange, President Donald Trump held forth for over an hour at a Friday night rally on topics including North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, health care, Hillary Clinton, and the National Football League, at one point even promising the crowd that he would campaign for Strange\u2019s opponent if he lost the primary. \u201cI told Luther if his opponent wins, I\u2019ll be here campaigning like hell for him,\u201d Trump told the Huntsville crowd, referring to former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore. He said Moore and Strange were \u201cboth good men.\u201d The Cotton State\u2019s GOP primary has drawn national attention because it pits two pro-Trump candidates, one establishment and one decidedly not, against each other. Sarah Palin and former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka held a rally this week for the ardently Christian firebrand Moore, who was suspended for refusing marriage license applications for same-sex couples. Trump, in a surprise move, aligned himself with Strange, the establishment favorite backed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). At the Huntsville rally, Trump tried to shift this perception, insisting that Strange would not do McConnell\u2019s bidding. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know Mitch McConnell at all. Luther is a tough cookie,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t kowtow to anybody.\u201d But the President didn\u2019t exactly stay on-message, telling the audience that he was \u201ctaking a big risk\u201d by involving himself in the primary because Strange, who has consistently trailed in the polls, could very well lose. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be doing it\u2014the last thing I want to do is be involved in a primary,\u201d Trump said, adding, \u201cI might have made a mistake.\u201d Seconds later, though, he insisted Strange was \u201cgoing to win easily\u201d and could easily defeat a Democrat in the December general election. The six-foot-nine Strange, who Trump said he had taken to calling \u201cBig Luther,\u201d faces a difficult road to victory in Tuesday\u2019s primary. The Washington Post reported that many supporters who packed the Von Braun Center were only there to see Trump and told the newspaper that they planned to vote for Moore. \u201cI don\u2019t know who this guy is,\u201d one Afghanistan war veteran told the Post of Strange. \u201cI\u2019m here for Trump.\u201d Those who showed up for a classic Trump rally got what they wanted. The President again weighed in on North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un\u2019s efforts to build nuclear weapons, calling him \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d and assuring the audience that he was \u201cgoing to handle it.\u201d He told the crowd, who broke into \u201cLock her up\u201d chants when Trump mentioned Clinton\u2019s name, to \u201cspeak to Jeff Sessions about that.\u201d Invoking his signature border wall, Trump said that it \u201chas to be see-through\u201d so that no criminals in \u201cwonderful, wonderful\u201d Mexico hit anyone on the U.S. side in the head when they catapult \u201ca hundred pounds of drugs\u201d over it. And he spoke at length about NFL players protesting police brutality and racism by refusing to stand during the national anthem, calling it a \u201ctotal disrespect of our heritage.\u201d Team owners should respond to those players, Trump said, by saying, \u201cGet that son of a bitch off the field right now, he\u2019s fired. He\u2019s fired!\u201d \u201cFor a week, (that owner would) be the most popular person in this country,\u201d the President continued, \u201cbecause that\u2019s a total disrespect of our heritage. That\u2019s a total disrespect for everything we stand for. The crowd began trickling out early after Trump\u2019s speech exceeded an hour, according to the Post. Strange, the candidate, had spoken for only four minutes.","label":0}
{"text":"Peace Through Violence: When a diagnosed schizophrenic who\u2019d been prescribed antipsychotic medicine plowed into a crowd of \u201cpeaceful protesters\u201d\u2014who were, in fact, illegally blocking a street\u2014and killed a woman in Charlottesville, VA on August 13, the perpetually self-discrediting establishment media seized on this incident as proof that Donald Trump and all his supporters were murderously violent Nazis. Last week when Trump held a press conference and stated the truth\u2014that there had been violence on \u201cboth sides\u201d in Charlottesville\u2014the ideology-blinded establishment press screamed bloody murder. When a female reporter asked him to denounce the Alt-Right, he flipped the script:  OK, what about the Alt-Left that came charging at\u2014excuse me\u2014what about the Alt-Left that came charging at the, as you say, the Alt-Right? Do they have any semblance of guilt?\u2026What about the fact that they came charging\u2014they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do\u2026.I think there\u2019s blame on both sides, and I have no doubt about it\u2026.you also had troublemakers and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats\u2014you had a lot of bad people in the other group, too.  There was collective face-palming and head-shaking and finger-wagging and pearl-clutching and vapor-sniffing and diaper-shitting at his comments\u2014not only among the resolutely leftist press, but among \u201cconservative\u201d placemats such as Mitt \u201cThe Loser\u201d Romney and Little Marco Rubio. As is the wont of people who place their half-assed public moral posturing above the truth, no one bothered to factually refute what Trump said. Ideologues\u2019 brains come Saran Wrapped with the presumption that they occupy the moral high ground; therefore, anything that contradicts their narrative is innately \u201cevil\u201d and cannot possibly be factual, so there is no sense in even attempting to argue facts. \u201cHere\u2019s the difference between words and violence: One involves words, the other involves violence. Glad I could clear that up.\u201d Of course there was leftist violence in Charlottesville. For at least the past decade in America, there seems to be leftist violence wherever a non-leftist attempts to speak publicly. They burned, smashed, and assaulted everything in their path at nearly every Trump campaign rally, while there was no hint of such right-wing behavior at Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton rallies. Based on the transparently fraudulent idea that publicly articulating any non-leftist ideas is equivalent to literal violence\u2014or at least it will inevitably lead to violence if the speaker isn\u2019t silenced and crushed\u2014they justify all the cement-filled bottles and human feces they toss at all the imaginary \u201cfascists\u201d and \u201cNazis\u201d they see wherever they turn. Their brains welded with endless propagandized horror about Hitler\u2019s Six Million, they either don\u2019t know or don\u2019t care about Marx\u2019s Hundred Million. This somehow allows them to see mere words as \u201cviolence\u201d and their literal violence as mere \u201cjustice.\u201d That\u2019s how insanely and arrogantly hypocritical they are. Here\u2019s the difference between words and violence: One involves words, the other involves violence. Glad I could clear that up. Watch this video that shows stoic would-be \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally attendees being taunted and heckled and poked from all sides as they try to safely get back to their vehicles and vamoose. Then try to tell me that the \u201cNazis\u201d were the only aggressors. Look at this footage (halfway down the page) of a TV reporter getting clubbed in the head by an Antifa goon in Charlottesville and tell me the violence only came from one side. And listen to how Antifa attempts to justify sending the man to the hospital to get four staples in his head:  Due to the intensity and context of this time people are very scared of white men running full speed at them with iPhones as this is the exact behavior of a white supremacist trying to out identity of people of color and anti fascists in order to invoke fear\u2026. He intentionally ignored the denial of consent, still without identifying himself (though we still wouldn\u2019t care), which was a threat to safety and should be considered in a context of perpetuating rape culture.  As far as I can discern, the reporter was only trying to film the festivities. Being a reporter for a TV station anywhere in America in 2017, odds are that he leans left. But since Antifa didn\u2019t like someone filming their animalistic behavior, he magically transformed into a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d who endorsed \u201crape culture,\u201d so there was nothing wrong with splitting his skull open. Beware of anyone who claims the moral high ground, because they will use their self-righteous delusions to justify the most depraved cruelties. In fact, fuck the idea of the \u201cmoral high ground\u201d altogether. In historical practice, that\u2019s nothing more than an illusion designed to make Church Ladies feel better about themselves. Seek the factual high ground. And the fact is, there was plenty of leftist violence in Charlottesville. Even worse than the leftist rioters\u2019 self-justifications are the justifications of a resolutely ideological press that enables them to get away with violence.

The video of Malia Obama, now a freshman at Harvard University, was first published by TMZ on Nov. 20 and quickly went viral. In the clip, Malia Obama can be seen kissing a young man who appeared to be a fellow Harvard student. Photos taken after the kiss show Malia Obama smoking what appears to be a cigarette. Three days later, a video surfaced allegedly showing Malia Obama blowing smoke rings. The Daily Caller reports the video was posted on Instagram by pop culture website Barstool Sports but later deleted. As positive and negative reactions to both videos swept social media, Ivanka Trump and Chelsea Clinton added their voices in defense of Obama. \"Malia Obama should be allowed the same privacy as her school aged peers,\" tweeted Ivanka Trump on Nov. 24. \"She is a young adult and private citizen, and should be OFF limits.\" Chelsea Clinton echoed Ivanka Trump's sentiment less than an hour later. \"Malia Obama's private life, as a young woman, a college student, a private citizen, should not be your clickbait,\" she wrote. \"Be better,\" Chelsea Clinton made similar comments in defense of first son Barron Trump, earlier this year, according to CBS News. In August, a reporter for The Daily Caller criticized 11-year-old Barron Trump for wearing a T-shirt and shorts while returning from a family vacation. After the article was published, Chelsea Clinton tweeted, \"It's high time the media  ; everyone leave Barron Trump alone  ; let him have the private childhood he deserves.\" Her tweet earned her the gratitude of Barron Trump's mother, first lady Melania Trump. \"Thank you [Chelsea Clinton] -- so important to support all of our children in being themselves! #StopChildhoodBullying,\" she tweeted in response. First children are typically considered out-of-bounds for reporters and photographers.

They've had a particularly cozy relationship with President Trump (pictured above hamming it up for a photo op with pharmaceutical executives). Good times! So it's a bit surprising to see Fox News release results of a recent poll... of their own viewers. Naturally, Fox wants to tell us what a great job Trump is doing and how impressed everyone is with him and his physique, right? Perhaps not anymore.

{"text":"EXCLUSIVE: Security Source Details Bill Clinton Maneuver to Meet Loretta Lynch: Attorney General Loretta Lynch. (Photo by Alex Wong\/Getty Images) Attorney General Loretta Lynch. (Photo by Alex Wong\/Getty Images) An exclusive interview with a security source who was present at the unplanned meeting Monday night on a Phoenix tarmac between former President Bill Clinton and Attorney General Lorretta Lynch has shed additional light on an unusual summit that is embroiling the AG in charges of favoritism. As attorney general, Lynch heads the Department of Justice just as it is deciding whether to proceed with charges against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton over her use of a private email server during her tenure as President Obama\u2019s secretary of state. The source has decades of experience providing security to government officials. The source spoke to the Observer for 20 minutes and answered follow-up questions via text message on the condition that no further details be revealed, including even gender, given the possibility of losing his or her job as an active overseer of security arrangements. This person was on-hand for the entirety of the meeting and some of its aftermath. According to this source, whose credentials were checked and confirmed by the Observer with sources inside both the FBI and the United States Secret Service, the attorney general was caught completely off guard by the meeting and the source dismisses suggestions that have been raised alleging that she waited there to see Bill Clinton or accommodated his request to see him. In fact, it seems from this source that it was Bill Clinton who was maneuvering for face time with the attorney general, because his plane had been scheduled to leave before hers arrived. \u201cFair is fair. I\u2019m a conservative-leaning [person] [gender-identifying word redacted]. I don\u2019t support anything this administration does. I don\u2019t know much about the attorney general\u2019s past, except she has a good reputation. But I really don\u2019t like this executive\u2019s office, so that said, politically, that\u2019s where I\u2019m at. But I just happened to be in a position to know firsthand what went down that day.\u201d The FBI protects the attorney general and the Secret Service protects POTUS and there are elements from that agency that protect former presidents. According to the source, \u201cThe AG and the director each have a protective detail because they travel extensively and that duty falls to the FBI. They have a formalized unit, a detail, that lives and works out of Washington, D.C. Then there will be FBI leaders who are experts in other towns and regions who coordinate visits\u2014someone in Chicago FBI will coordinate with the D.C. detail when the director or the AG comes to Chicago. So what happened here is that the FBI agents in Phoenix were in touch with the detail leaders in D.C. for the AG\u2019s visit. Somebody from D.C. will advance the trip and liaise with the local element, who has a big SWAT team and provide everything they need so they can send only a skeletal unit with her, two people\u2014a medic and protection. They don\u2019t need to commit 27 people. Details include surveilling all the locations, the routes, the hospitals, safe zones; that\u2019s all handled by [the local FBI people] [actual words redacted to avoid identifying source].\u201d According to the source, the FBI agents protecting Lynch \u201cknew former POTUS was in town and another executive was coming and knew Lynch was coming so we knew there\u2019d be congestion. We were waiting for her plane to touch down at the executive terminal area of Phoenix\u2019s Sky Harbor where it\u2019s best suited to control. Clinton\u2019s plane was on the ground already. But he wasn\u2019t there. We had been hoping to get him out before she arrived, just to avoid too much traffic. They [their planes] were 75 yards apart. We have a procedure we do to clear [space for] a motorcade. As we were ready to receive her, I saw the other motorcade coming in\u2014we were like, \u2018great timing.\u2019 \u201d The source was being sarcastic in saying \u201cgreat timing,\u201d indicating that it would have been better logistically for Clinton\u2019s plane to take off before Lynch\u2019s arrived, to avoid the congestion of two motorcades on the tarmac at once. The source indicated that Clinton\u2019s people at the airport didn\u2019t know what was taking Clinton\u2019s motorcade so long to arrive and speculated that the delay was engineered specifically so that Clinton would not have left before Lynch arrived. \u201cThen I see Clinton walking over. His detail guys ran over to hers and said he\u2019s coming. \u2018He\u2019s closing.\u2019 He walked straight there to the Air Force guy at the door and next thing I know he\u2019s going up the steps [of her plane].\u201d Asked about the Air Force detail, the source later clarified to the Observer that \u201cThere was an Air Force airman at the base of the stairs of the [Lynch] aircraft, as you always see on TV with POTUS.\u201d According to the source, \u201cNobody knew this was coming. We just knew to be aware there were other events going on. There was no planned meeting. It was just chance contact. The fact is, he just started walking over. I don\u2019t think it was pre-arranged. He just started walking over and [even her security] can\u2019t tell him, \u2018you can\u2019t do that.\u2019 He walked in her plane for at least 20 to 25 minutes and the FBI is standing face to face with the Secret Service and just chatting on the hot tarmac like, \u2018what the hell.\u2019 \u201d Regarding the reaction and its aftermath, the source told the Observer, \u201cI didn\u2019t think of the political ramifications, just the timing, \u2019cause we had other things to do. He [Clinton] came off and shook the hands of the heads of Lynch\u2019s detail. Then her detail finally got her off the plane, now much delayed, and departed for her day\u2019s events. She had a series of visits planned for Tuesday.\u201d The source said that the impromptu visit made an immediate impression upon Lynch\u2019s staff (meaning her non-security personnel). \u201cI don\u2019t agree with her politics and all that, but I knew from the beginning that she got caught off guard and her staff was already talking about it that it\u2019s going to be a political problem for her. Her staff was flipping out. We didn\u2019t think about the political part until we saw her staff flipping out. For the security guys, it was more of a \u2018I\u2019ve got armed guys coming into my perimeter\u2019 problem. But the staff guys saw right away that it was a political problem. After Clinton got off, they were like, \u2018that wasn\u2019t good.\u2019 And I know from others who were in the actual car with her that her people knew immediately the political ramifications of it and were very upset.\u201d The meeting has indeed turned into a political firestorm for the attorney general, with President Obama\u2019s press secretary, Josh Earnest, declining to say whether the interaction between the powerful husband of a person being investigated and the attorney general was appropriate. In a sit-down with The Washington Post\u2018s Jonathan Capehart in Aspen, Colo., earlier this morning, the columnist grilled her about the meeting: \u201cWhat on Earth were you thinking?\u201d he asked her, in an otherwise very friendly interview.","label":0}

AT ;T, whose ownership of the DirecTV satellite service makes it the biggest U.S. pay-television provider, said late Wednesday it will report a third-quarter loss of 390,000 satellite and cable customers, echoing a similar warning weeks earlier from Comcast Corp. The same night, Viacom cautioned that its distribution deal with Charter Communications Inc., the second-biggest cable U.S. company, may lead to a blackout, potentially testing whether millions of viewers are willing to go without MTV and Nickelodeon.\u201d  These companies are being cut off at the knees.

The other one allows a judge to issue an order for the confiscation of an individual\u2019s firearms without their knowledge, let alone permission.  SB 719 allows a judge to issue an Extreme Risk Protection Order which demands a gun owner hand over all firearms as well as any concealed carry permit. The NRA had some thoughts about this, naturally:  Based on a California law enacted in 2014, SB 719A would create a so-called \u201cExtreme Risk Protection Order\u201d (ERPO) that could be obtained by a law enforcement officer, family member, or household member in an ex parte hearing to deprive someone of their Second Amendment rights without due process of the law. The ex parte aspect of the law means the bill does not require the gun owner to be present for part of the hearing in which the judge decides whether guns should be taken from him.  This is an atrocity and is a direct violation of the Second Amendment.

{"text":"Facebook bans white nationalist's accounts over hate speech: MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Facebook has banned the Facebook and Instagram accounts of a white nationalist who attended the rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that ended in deadly violence. Facebook spokeswoman Ruchika Budhraja tells The Associated Press that the profile pages of Christopher Cantwell have been removed as well as a page connected to his podcast. Cantwell was featured in a Vice News documentary about the rally and its aftermath. Facebook has also removed at least eight pages connected to the white nationalist movement over what Budhraja says were violations on the company's polices on hate speech and organizations. Cantwell, of Keene, New Hampshire, was listed on rally flyers and labeled an extremist by the Southern Poverty Law Center. A former information technology worker who moved to New Hampshire from New York in 2012, the 36-year-old Cantwell describes himself as a white nationalist and said he voted for President Donald Trump. He has a podcast and blog that promote his views. Cantwell says Facebook shut down his account in an attempt to silence him for his views. He also said his PayPal account had been closed. The company wouldn't confirm that because it has a policy of not commenting on the status of accounts. \"I'm not surprised by almost any of this because the whole thing we are complaining about here is that we are trying to express our views, and everybody is going through extraordinary lengths to make sure we are not heard,\" Cantwell said in a phone interview from an undisclosed location. \"Frankly, whatever you think of my views, that is very scary to me,\" he said. \"Facebook and Instagram is one thing but not being able to participate in the financial system because of your political opinions is something that, you know, people should worry about in America.\"","label":0}

{"text":"College students to protest ex-Rep. Allen West's speech: \u00a9 Getty Images Students at Saint Louis University in Missouri plan to protest former Rep. Allen West\u2019s (R-Fla.) speech there Thursday, according to a new report. Protesters are upset about the retired Army lieutenant colonel calling the school's Muslim Student Association a \u201cstealth jihad radical Islamic campus organization.\u201d \u201cOur administrator made a request for him to tailor his speech to our community, and in response he made a lot of hateful comments about our students,\u201d student Claire Cunningham told The Riverfront Times. Cunningham, who is a member of Leadership for Social Change, said West angered SLU students with a blog post last week. In that post, West said the college was trying to censor him by preventing him from using the phrase \"radical Islam.\" SLU students now plan on showing West his post was \u201cunbelievably out of line\u201d with their school's values, Cunningham said. \u201cOur biggest concern is not necessarily that a conservative speaker is coming, because we believe in free speech,\u201d she said. The Riverfront Times said West plans to speak on behalf of SLU\u2019s Young Republicans and Young America\u2019s Foundation (YAF), a conservative organization. YAF announced last week that an SLU administrator told West he could not use the phrase \u201cradical Islam\u201d on advertisements for his speech. West responded on his blog, accusing SLU of censoring him in the name of political correctness. \u201cIt appears there are those who define free speech as the speech they deem acceptable,\u201d he said last week. \"If you attempt to speak on issues to which the liberal progressive socialist left does not consent, you are censored. \u201cOr at a minimum, the little cupcakes ask for a \u2018safe space\u2019 where they don\u2019t have to hear opposing views \u2014 and here we were under the impression that institutions of higher learning were supposed to be places to encourage the free exchange of ideas.\u201d West also called SLU\u2019s Muslim Student Association (MSA) a \u201cstealth jihad radical Islamic campus organization\u201d for its role in the disagreement. \u201cI recommend to the president of St. Louis University, you do not want it known that a radical Islamic organization is dictating speakers on your campus,\u201d he said. The Riverfront Times said demonstrators now plan on peacefully selling cupcakes outside West\u2019s speech to taunt the former lawmaker. Proceeds from the cupcakes will go to a charity benefitting Syrian refugees. The MSA, meanwhile, is planning on staging a walkout protest of West\u2019s address Thursday evening. \u201cThe false comments that this individual made on September 22, 2016 are being used to incite fear in the SLU community,\u201d the group said in an email obtained by YAF Thursday. \u201cIn the current climate where Islamophobia is manifesting through violence against Muslims, this kind of rhetoric is not only offensive but dangerous, as evidenced through a number of burnings of mosques and attacks on individual Muslims following comments such as these.\"","label":0}
{"text":"Donald Trump misses the point on ISIS and Islam: \u00a9 Getty Images During Sunday\u2019s presidential debate, an audience member asked the 2016 candidates a question about Islamophobia. In response, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump stressed the importance of recognizing and solving radical Islamic terrorism. To do this, Trump explained, \u201cWe have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.\u201d Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton responded by calling his earlier position and rhetoric of banning Muslims \u201cshortsighted\u201d and \u201cdangerous.\u201d Clinton explained that, \u201cWhat Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.\u201d And she is right. Ostracizing the Muslim community is fodder for ISIS propaganda. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) operates under the veneer of religion. Although their propaganda perpetuates the falsehood that they are killing in the name of Allah, the reality is that most ISIS fighters are being exploited for the benefit of war profiteers and Godless opportunists. Islamic theologians around the world agree that ISIS leadership manipulates the interpretation of the Quran to fit its personal agenda and then disseminates this message through clever propaganda, charismatic speeches and intensive instruction\/brainwashing. Targeting Muslims for the actions of ISIS fosters the perceived religious connection between ISIS and Islam, promoting their primary source of manipulated legitimacy. Moreover, targeting people on the basis of Islamic religion is not an effective exercise for counterterrorism, considering that (1) ISIS is active in recruiting non-Muslim converts and (2) the vast majority of true Muslims are familiar enough with their religion to completely dismiss ISIS' manipulated interpretation of the Quran. In order to effectively combat ISIS and protect the world from their continued wrath, it is important for the presidential hopefuls to understand who exactly is being recruited into terrorism. Prior to being conscripted, prospective extremists often aren't particularly religious and typically live on the margins of society. Recruiters target people who are in need to become their martyrs, and engage these prospects by temporarily filling \u2014 or simply making the false promise to fulfill \u2014 the needs in their life. For citizens of countries like Syria, Iraq and Tunisia, this means offering basic physiological sustenance to support their families: employment, food, money and\/or safety from their wrath. For citizens of industrialized countries, like France, the United States, Canada and Australia, this means offering prospective recruits a sense of belonging, \u201clove,\u201d esteem and\/or self-actualization. Following the debate, many Muslim viewers on social media expressed that they felt Trump\u2019s response was Islamophobic. Rhetoric that alienates the Muslim community for the actions of ISIS helps further the fabricated religious connection that fuels their perceived legitimacy. Moreover, denying refugee status for people trying to escape the Islamic State will also increase the sampling pool for ISIS recruiters. While the safety of Americans should be paramount to any commander in chief, the fact of the matter is that the current refugee vetting system is incredibly thorough. According to a report from the CATO Institute, \"Of the 859,629 refugees who have entered the United States since 2001, three have been convicted for planning a terrorist attack abroad and exactly zero have perpetrated domestic attacks.\u201d Given these statistics and the humanitarian crisis in Syria, some would say that the United States has a moral obligation to take in more Syrian refugees. However, this cannot be done in a vacuum. Refugees in the United States often settle in lower socioeconomic areas. This puts them at continued risk of becoming the victims of crime and\/or recruitment targets of organized crime groups. In order to responsibly accept refugees, America must continue vetting them thoroughly and provide adequate social and security support upon arrival and thereafter. Ultimately, it is extremely difficult for a Syrian to become a refugee in the United States. According to the CATO Institute, there is a 0.042 percent chance of a Syrian refugee entering the United States after spending at least three years in a refugee camp. It is easier for ISIS to secure student visas, tourist visas and business visas, or to simply recruit lawful permanent residents or citizens in the United States. Although we may not know exactly who we are admitting in the short term, the risk is extremely low, and denying admission to refugees is much more dangerous \u2014 for them and us \u2014 in the long term.

{"text":"Sheriff David Clarke: Our domestic security failure: \u00a9 Getty Images As another terror attack struck the homeland, this time returning to New York City, local politicians rushed to calm fears by parsing over whether it was an act of international terror or a \u201clone-wolf attack,\u201d as if that matters. In short order the FBI announced that an arrest has been made, which signaled to someone like me in law enforcement that we would learn the suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami was previously known to the FBI. He was. We\u2019re told that no probable cause existed to arrest Rahami before he attacked. We have seen this response over and over again. Although true, that statement also reveals a deeper, systemic problem. ISIS has declared war on America. We need to use a war model to prosecute this campaign and instead we are using a law-enforcement model which seeks probable cause to arrest, a very high standard often times not achievable until after an attack (crime) occurs and then enough evidence that will stand up in a court of law. The actors, whether part of an international organization or radicalized American citizens, are enemy combatants, not common criminals. As soon as the planning stage begins they should be picked up and held indefinitely, preferably at Gitmo.As a law-enforcement leader who deals with domestic terrorism and attacks on our population on the front lines, it is imperative that I relay one crucial bit of intelligence from my end: we are not structured properly and thus unable to defend the homeland adequately until our domestic intelligence apparatus changes drastically. The mission of a true intelligence agency is to disrupt, prevent and detect terror attacks before they occur. An arrest is not necessarily the goal. Informing decision-makers in enough time to act is the goal. I have been sounding the alarm about this for the past several years, but it is up to Americans to demand a change from their government. Our lives continue to be lost, people maimed, and populations increasingly terrorized, for the simple reason that we have put the wrong organization with the wrong mission in charge: the FBI. President Obama declared this great work even though 29 people were injured and a million others psychologically damaged. It was an intelligence failure. Americans respect their law enforcement and their government, but there comes a point when we have to ask for some accountability from those tasked with this job. Right now, the FBI is the lead domestic security agency. As in nearly every other attack they looked, found no probable cause to arrest and turned away. Continuing to ask the FBI to handle domestic security is wrongheaded and dangerous for one simple reason: the FBI is structured to investigate law violations, not produce intelligence. The FBI reports directly to the Department of Justice Attorney General\u2014a highly politicized entity\u2014and must establish the high standard of \u201cprobable cause\u201d as part of their investigative approach to domestic security. If there\u2019s no viable case early on, as DOJ officials instruct, the scrutiny of a potential terrorist becomes a matter of wasted resources. Dangerous men and women fall off watch-lists and more Americans live in fear waiting for the next attack. In the wake of recent attacks on American soil, from Orlando to San Bernardino and now Minnesota and New York City, it is clearer than ever that the FBI\u2019s law-enforcement approach is unable to disrupt enough fatal and dangerous attacks against our domestic targets before they happen. President Obama has offered a solution: the pathetic, weak, and un-American, \u201clearn to live with it.\u201d That kind of capitulation to hate and murderers is not acceptable to me, nor should it be to any American. We don\u2019t give up or change our way of life like at airports simply to protect a bureaucratic system that is failing, or because we are afraid of truly taking on an enemy intent on destroying Western culture. We require the proper organization and organizing mission that focuses instead on identifying potential threats, establishing what capabilities they have, determining if an attack is being planned, and alerting decision-makers. This organization does not exist here as of yet, but it needs to, and quick. A new entity focused on protection, not prosecution, is the only way to protect Americans. We live in a new era; like it or not, the enemy is at war with us, and they\u2019ve come to our home soil. This isn\u2019t the time to plant rose bushes and go about our daily lives, it\u2019s time to assess, adjust our protocol, and stand up for American lives. President Obama isn\u2019t doing it. The media isn\u2019t able to even articulate what this war is about. It\u2019s up to the American people to demand that a new domestic security entity take up the protection of the homeland.

{"text":"Brent Budowsky: McCain, VFW shame Trump on Gold Star family: \u00a9 Getty Images Every day the evidence mounts that Donald Trump, the presidential candidate favored by Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, is temperamentally, intellectually and morally unfit to be commander in chief of the American military. The latest example of Trump\u2019s disastrous ignorance and ideas about national security is his insulting treatment of the Gold Star mom and dad of the intensely patriotic and heroic Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in action saving the lives of others who were risking their lives to defend our country alongside him. Today Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) added his powerful and nationally respected voice to the chorus of condemnation that Trump is receiving from leading veterans groups, who are expressing outrage and indignation against the billionaire\u2019s insults of Khizr Khan, the fallen hero\u2019s Gold Star father, and Ghazala Khan, his Gold Star mother. In a deeply patriotic and passionate 697-word statement, McCain discussed at length his family tradition of military service and his outrage against the insults Trump directed against Khan\u2019s mother and father. He also correctly noted that Trump\u2019s extreme position against immigration of Muslims into America would have prevented Muslim-American heroes such as Khan from coming to America, serving our country and saving countless lives. And I would add that many military and intelligence leaders, including David Petraeus, the retired general and former CIA director, have condemned Trump\u2019s ideas against Muslims as providing aid, comfort and support to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and other terror groups that seek to attack America. Also today the Veterans of Foreign Wars, one of America\u2019s largest and leading veterans organizations, which represents those who wore the uniform over many generations, added its national voice to the condemnation of Trump\u2019s insults against the Gold Star mother and father of Capt. Khan. McCain, the VFW, veterans groups and patriotic Americans of all persuasions treat respect of Gold Star mothers as a sacred trust, which Trump violated \u2014 just the latest example in the litany of insults that he has directed against one group of Americans after another. McCain continues to reluctantly support Trump and the future will tell if his support will continue; as the VFW\u2019s statement notes, our respect and admiration for Gold Star mothers and fathers transcends all partisan and electoral considerations. I do not support Trump. In fact I believe his insults against the Khans is only the latest example of why I and many others believe that Trump as commander in chief would be a major national risk to America\u2019s national security and those who serve to protect and defend it. Over the weekend the GOP\u2019s nominee stated that Russia has not intervened in Ukraine, a false and ignorant statement that is universally known to be incorrect. Not long ago he told The New York Times, doubling down on this statement since, that if Russia invaded Europe he would not come to Europe\u2019s defense if he believed that European nations did not meet his standards of defense spending. It is unprecedented for any American president since the creation of NATO, Democratic or Republican, and for any leader of any European democracy, conservative or liberal, to state that the United States might not defend Europe from a Russian invasion and an attempt to establish a Russian dictatorship over any nation that belongs to NATO. Trump has repeatedly stated that he would order American troops to commit acts of torture if he is elected, which some leading retired military commanders have already stated they would refuse to obey because it would constitute an international war crime and make American prisoners of war vulnerable to torture from our enemies. Leading intelligence professionals now believe that Russia has embarked on an aggressive campaign of espionage and cyber warfare and information warfare against America designed to attack Hillary Clinton and elect the candidate they favor: Donald Trump. Make no mistake. In the most important sense Russia is waging an undeclared war against America, conducted not with troops and bombs but with cyber warfare, to hack our systems and information warfare to leak information received through espionage, to help Trump, and to defeat Clinton, at crucial moments such as the Democratic National Convention. After the Russian espionage was revealed, Trump took the inexcusable action of publicly supporting and encouraging this Russian cyber invasion of America, in this Russian attempt to help Trump become commander in chief. Trump repeated this view a number of times, and tried to retreat by laughably pretending it was just a bad joke. Regarding this latest Trump insult against the Khans, the loud and rising chorus of condemnation may well force Trump to retract his comments. But whether or not this happens, what Trump said attacking and insulting a Gold Star mother and Gold Star father is one more example of why America should never allow his finger to be on the nuclear war button, and why voters should never allow a man with his temperament and vices to be commander in chief.

{"text":"Dick Morris: Why Obama spared ISIS oil: \u00a9 Getty Images Last week, on the \u201cCharlie Rose\u201d show, former Obama CIA Director Mike Morell dropped a bombshell that was little noticed by the media. He said that the reason President Obama did not bomb the oil fields now controlled by Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) was that he did not want to cause environmental damage. Morell said that \u201cwe didn\u2019t go after oil wells, actually hitting oil wells that ISIS controls, because we didn\u2019t want to do environmental damage and we didn\u2019t want to destroy that infrastructure.\u201d If ever a statement by a former administration official offered a glimpse into the looney priorities of the Obama administration, this is it! We did not bomb the oil fields upon which ISIS depends for the bulk of its revenue because of our concerns about adding to the carbon emissions that promote global warming (in the desert). So we let ISIS rake in millions of dollars every day, selling about 100,000 barrels of oil at an average of about $20\/barrel (discounted) for a take of $2 million every day. ISIS may be led by radical, crazy jihadists, but the rank and file of the ISIS military is reported to be paid soldiers fighting for money. Cut off the money and you cut off the army. But Obama put the minor, incremental damage of destroying the oil fields ahead of the need to stop ISIS from rampaging through the Western world, killing people at random. He apparently worried that the effects of destroying the oil wells could be severe. This kind of environmental fantasizing was in vogue during the Gulf War, when Saddam Hussein\u2019s destruction of all of Kuwait\u2019s oil fields was thought to be likely to cause huge damage. Paul Crutzen, a noted atmospheric scientist, predicted that a \u201cnuclear winter\u201d might ensue with a cloud of smoke covering half the Northern Hemisphere for at least 100 days. Carl Sagan argued that the effects of the destruction of Kuwaiti oil fields could be comparable to the explosion of the volcano Tambora in 1815, which produced \u201ca year without summer.\u201d It never happened. Scientist Patrick K. Dowling wrote, in his study \u201cThe Meteorological Effects of the Kuwaiti Oil Fires,\u201d that the smoke only affected the weather pattern throughout the Persian Gulf and surrounding region during the periods that the fires were burning in 1991. A 1992 study found that emissions of carbon dioxide were only 2 percent of global emissions. Big deal. Remember that Kuwait produced about 2 million barrels per day before the Gulf War \u2014 at least 10 times as much as the ISIS oil wells generate. The Kuwaiti fires dwarf anything destroying the ISIS oil wells would produce when it comes to any harmful environmental effects. Why isn\u2019t Obama using our air power to attack tankers carrying ISIS oil to refineries in Turkey? Again, we wanted to fight the world\u2019s first green war. As Morell put it, \u201cThere seemed to have been a judgment that, look, we don\u2019t want to destroy these oil tankers because that\u2019s infrastructure that\u2019s going to be necessary to support the people when ISIS isn\u2019t there anymore and it\u2019s going to create environmental damage.\u201d Once again, Obama wants to fight terrorism, but everything else comes first. Morell noted that the administration didn\u2019t even want to hit oil trucks carrying fuel from ISIS oil fields. To enter the mind of Barack Obama and see the low priority he accords fighting terrorism is to see a nightmare unfolding. How can we trust him to keep us safe and to keep out ISIS terrorists who have so thoroughly infiltrated the ranks of Syrian refugees? With Obama, protecting Americans from terror comes in last in his list of priorities. Morris, who served as adviser to former Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and former President Clinton, is the author of 17 books, including his latest, \u201cPower Grab: Obama\u2019s Dangerous Plan for a One Party Nation\u201d and \u201cHere Come the Black Helicopters.\u201d To get all of his and Eileen McGann\u2019s columns for free by email, go to dickmorris.com.","label":1}
{"text":"Juan Williams: Trump's race politics will destroy GOP: \u00a9 Getty Images Now for some startling opinions about race relations and the current leader of the Republican Party, Donald Trump. In the opinion of 50 percent of all Americans, the word 'racist' fits Trump either \"very well\" or \"somewhat well,\" according to a July poll from the Associated Press and GfK. Most of those people \u2014 35 percent of the overall population \u2014 said the term fits the GOP nominee \"very well.\" Here\u2019s another eye-opening opinion: Most Americans, 56 percent, \u201cbelieve that Trump is biased against women and minorities,\u201d according to an August Washington Post poll. Last week, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said Trump is \u201ctaking hate groups mainstream,\u201d and \u201chelping a radical fringe take over one of America\u2019s two major political parties.\u201d Trump tried to reduce the accusations to a game of tit-for-tat by calling her a \"bigot.\u201d But Clinton\u2019s words simply amplified what Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said months ago, after Trump attacked an Indiana-born judge as being incapable of fairness because of his Mexican heritage. Ryan said Trump\u2019s remarks amounted to a \u201ctextbook definition of a racist comment.\u201d The damage Trump is doing to the GOP is evident in polls showing more than 12 percent of registered Republicans intend to vote for Clinton. GOP-leaning independent voters are staying away from Trump, too. The latest Quinnipiac poll had Clinton with 51 percent support and the Republican nominee fading. As a result, the GOP is now likely to lose control of the Senate and lose seats in the House in the fall election. And yet Speaker Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus have decided they have to stand with Trump \u2014 even as he destroys their party. Much of the damage is directly tied to Trump\u2019s racial politics. Long before Trump, the GOP already had few black and Latino elected officials. The party is in desperate need of more women as well as racial and ethnic diversity to keep up with the reality of the nation\u2019s changing demographics. A wider range of people backing conservative principles \u2014 from small government and low taxes, to free trade and policies supporting strong families \u2014 is not tokenism. It is a necessity if the party is to remain relevant to policy debates and have any chance of winning in the future. And there are churchgoing, family loving black people, Latinos and immigrants who share those values but see the GOP as an exclusively white party. The potential power of a racially diverse GOP was on display this year in the ongoing controversy over police use of excessive force against blacks. The debate was an exercise in polarization between Republican law-and-order voices backing the police and Democrats backing the controversial Black Lives Matter group when Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) stood up. Even in a business suit and wearing a lapel pin signifying that he is a member of the Senate, Scott recalled being treated like a criminal suspect by Capitol Police: \u201cThe officer looked at me, full of attitude\u2026 I was thinking to myself, either he thinks I\u2019m committing a crime \u2014 impersonating a member of Congress \u2014 or what?\u201d As a black man, a conservative and a Republican senator, Scott said he has \u201cfelt the anger\u2026that comes with feeling like you are being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself.\u201d And when the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s former Grand Wizard endorsed Trump by saying it is \u201ctreason\u201d against white heritage to fail to vote for Trump, Scott again spoke up: \u201cAny candidate who cannot immediately condemn a hate group like the KKK does not represent the Republican Party,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Donald Trump can\u2019t take a stand against the KKK, we cannot trust him to stand up for America against Putin, Iran or ISIS.\u201d Scott\u2019s stand against Trump now can be seen as an early storm warning. As Labor Day approaches, the awful reality of what Trump has done to the GOP goes beyond polls showing Trump is on track to lose more than 90 percent of the black vote and around 80 percent of the Latino vote. The real issue for the GOP is that the latest polls have him losing white women with college degrees. That is devastating to the Republican brand. Trump\u2019s recent speeches about black America to overwhelmingly white audiences \u2014 asking black people \u201cwhat the hell do you have to lose?\u201d by voting for him \u2014 is an effort to regain the support of white Republicans who do not want to vote for someone viewed as a bigot. Trump established himself in national Republican politics five years ago by pushing the racist conspiracy theory that President Obama was not an American citizen. Trump\u2019s shameful stoking of this effort to undermine the credibility of the first black president remains an issue. A disturbing poll from NBC News\/Survey Monkey taken earlier this month found that a shockingly low 25 percent of Republicans agreed with the statement \u201c Barack Obama was born in the U.S.\u201d The GOP\u2019s problem with black voters didn\u2019t begin when Barack Obama became president and it won\u2019t end when he leaves the White House. Even as he swept 49 states in his 1984 reelection, Ronald Reagan only won 9 percent of the black vote. George W. Bush fared only slightly better in his 2004 re-election, netting 11 percent of the black vote but put blacks in his cabinet, notably Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. Ryan, to his credit, has tried to follow in the footsteps of his mentor, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, who famously toured black communities promoting economic growth with \u201cempowerment zones.\u201d Trump is squandering those decades of efforts on race by Republicans. Ryan, McConnell and Priebus need to dump Trump and save their party. Juan Williams is an author and political analyst for Fox News Channel.

{"text":"Juan Williams: Clinton spoke the truth on 'deplorables': She called out the haters, the bigots and the racists as a \u201cbasket of deplorables.\u201d David Axelrod, President Obama\u2019s former top political guru, called Clinton\u2019s words a \u201cmistake\u201d that might allow Republican nominee Donald Trump to \u201cseize the high ground.\u201d The New York Times\u2019 liberal editorial page similarly concluded \u201creal damage had been done\u201d because Clinton had written off a group of voters by saying they were \u201cirredeemable.\u201d Sally Kohn, the left-leaning CNN commentator, wrote in The Washington Post that \u201cwhat is, in fact, deplorable is not only that Clinton said this but that she apparently believes it.\u201d Kohn explained that while Trump is clearly \u201crunning a xenophobic campaign that\u2019s pandering to white nationalism,\u201d most of his supporters are filled with \u201cresentment that is partly about identity but also about economic suffering.\u201d Clinton, Kohn argued, \u201cshould be reaching out to these voters, not offending them.\u201d This line of thinking from influential white Democrats reminded me of a line in President Reagan\u2019s 1989 farewell address: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to see what you see.\u201d And here is what I see: Mike Pence, Trump\u2019s vice presidential running mate, was asked a few days after Clinton\u2019s speech if he would call former Ku Klux Klan leader and white supremacist David Duke a \"deplorable.\" \"No, I'm not in the name-calling business,\u201d Pence responded, refusing to condemn an indisputable racist and Trump supporter. Instead, Pence complained: \"What Hillary Clinton did Friday night was shocking. I mean, the millions of people who support Donald Trump around this country are not a basket of anything.\" And then I saw Trump\u2019s son, Donald Jr., post an image of his dad, Pence and Alex Jones. Jones is best known for advancing the conspiracy theory that the U.S. government was behind the 9\/11 terrorist attacks that killed almost 3,000 people. Jones has also suggested the government is putting chemical additives into juice boxes, intending to make children homosexual to control population growth. And Jones claims the massacre of school children at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012 was staged as part of a government plot to enact gun control and that no children were actually killed there. Trump has praised Jones for \u201chis amazing reputation\u201d and appeared as a guest on his show during the GOP primaries. Earlier this month, Trump Jr. tweeted an article from Jones\u2019 website which stated that Hillary Clinton was wearing an earpiece during a forum with Matt Lauer on NBC News. Clinton was not wearing an earpiece, of course. At a Trump rally last week in Asheville, N.C., a 69-year-old woman protesting against the GOP nominee at one of the candidate\u2019s rallies was punched in the face by a Trump supporter. She later called a North Carolina television station to ask if people found a Trump supporter punching her in the face \u2018deplorable\u2019? So, I see a lot of deplorable behavior. But some political thought-leaders \u2014 including some Clinton supporters \u2014 prefer to excuse it as the actions of a few misguided people and not representative of most Trump supporters. Can we determine if close to half of Trump supporters hold deplorable beliefs? Let\u2019s go to the polls. An April poll taken by Reuters found that a large percentage of self-described Trump supporters describe black people as more \u201clazy\u201d than whites (40 percent), \u201cless intelligent\u201d than whites (32 percent), more \u201crude\u201d than whites (44 percent), more \u201cviolent\u201d than whites (48 percent) and more \u201ccriminal\u201d than whites (46 percent). Another Reuters poll taken in July found that 58 percent of Trump supporters have either a \u201cvery unfavorable\u201d or \u201csomewhat unfavorable\u201d view of the entire religion of Islam. These are racist views. If they do not count as \u201cdeplorable,\u201d then the word \u201cdeplorable\u201d no longer has any meaning. By the way, a Washington Post\/ABC News poll has 60 percent of Americans agreeing that Trump is personally \u201cbiased against women and minorities.\u201d Another shocking poll from NBC News\/Survey Monkey taken in August found that just 27 percent of Republicans agreed with the statement \u201c Barack Obama was born in the U.S.\u201d Trump burst on to the national political stage five years ago as the \u201cbirther-in-chief,\u201d perpetuating this overtly racist conspiracy theory about the first black President of the United States. Only last week did he finally \u2014 and briefly \u2014 acknowledge that Obama was born in the United States. As she prepares for her first debate with Trump next week, Clinton needs to unapologetically remind voters \u2014 especially traditional Republicans who are uncomfortable with seeing their party overrun by extremists \u2014 of the racist, paranoid fringes that Trump has invited into the nation\u2019s politics under the banner of the Republican Party. Clinton laid the groundwork in a speech in Nevada last month when she declared that \"a fringe element has effectively taken over the Republican Party.\" She accused Trump of \u201cdisregard for the values that make our country.\" After being scolded for her \u2018deplorables\u2019 comment, Clinton backtracked. She explained that she was being \u201cgrossly generalistic\u2026I regret saying \u2018half\u2019 \u2013 that was wrong.\u201d Clinton should not have apologized. Calling out the bullies and the bigots in a national presidential election is brave. Listen to her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.). \u201cShe advanced the notion that if you\u2019re chumming around with the head of the KKK \u2026 that\u2019s deplorable,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to call that out. If you\u2019re attacking immigrants, that\u2019s deplorable. If you\u2019re attacking LGBT Americans, that\u2019s deplorable. If you\u2019re attacking people because they\u2019re Muslims, that\u2019s deplorable.\u201d To quote President Reagan once again: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to see what you see.\u201d Juan Williams is an author and political analyst for Fox News Channel.

{"text":"Markos Moulitsas: The real terrorist threat: \u00a9 Getty Images It\u2019s tough being a conservative these days. After attacking President Obama as \u201cweak on terrorism\u201d for nearly seven years, the nation hasn\u2019t suffered a single terrorist attack even remotely like the 9\/11 terrorist attack during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency or the Beirut barracks bombings during Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency. As much as conservatives claim that Democratic policies harm the nation, it\u2019s Republican administrations that have had the weakest record when it comes to keeping our nation safe. In fact, one could argue that conservative policies are a root cause of terrorism, whether it is encouraging a foreign policy that breeds new terrorists overseas or cheering on the kind of lax gun laws and racist xenophobia that enable domestic terrorists such as Dylann Roof in South Carolina. After all, it\u2019s no accident that Donald Trump inspired two Boston brothers into beating a Latino homeless man senseless. Violent right-wingers certainly don\u2019t lack passion. In a study by the United States Military Academy, American Muslims accounted for 20 successful plots since 9\/11, leading to 50 fatalities. In contrast, right-wing extremists averaged 337 attacks per year, killing 254 people. And those numbers have only increased since the study was published in 2012. Meanwhile, the government\u2019s ability to monitor and thwart such attacks was crippled by conservative anger over the 2009 Department of Homeland Security report detailing the danger from this violent fringe. And then there\u2019s terrorism enabled by our nation\u2019s lax gun laws. According to the Mass Shooting Tracker, there have already been 273 shootings in which more than three people were wounded or killed people this year, killing a total of 346 and wounding 1,004. But like right-wing violence, conservatives don\u2019t consider this epidemic \u201cterrorism,\u201d proving their definition is conveniently narrow enough to exclude any violence that doesn\u2019t justify their next war. With the dearth of successful Islamist attacks on this country, it\u2019s only mildly surprising that a conservative like 20-year-old Joshua Goldberg would try to spark things into action. Goldberg worked closely with conservative news outlet Breitbart on efforts to discredit the Black Lives Matter movement, tried tirelessly to smear human rights groups including the Human Rights Law Center and Amnesty International, and was an avid participant in the \u201cGamergate\u201d movement, a misogynist effort to drive out feminists from the video game industry. And last week, Goldberg was arrested for conspiring with a supposed agent of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria to bomb a 9\/11 vigil service in Kansas City, Mo. According to the indictment, Goldberg didn\u2019t just advise the would-be terrorist on how to build a bomb, he also advised him to dip the shrapnel in rat poison so that victims\u2019 wounds wouldn\u2019t clot, thus increasing their chances of bleeding to death. It seems incredible that right-wing conservatives would go to such great lengths to harm fellow Americans, but there is a palpable sense of desperation among the radicalized fringe as American culture leaves them behind. They have spent years claiming that Obama\u2019s every step will lead to a loss of \u201cfreedom\u201d and the Islamization of this country, yet Americans now widely embrace marriage equality, racial and religious tolerance, and even ObamaCare. The nation\u2019s deficit is down, the economy and job picture are improving, healthcare costs are contained, and Hillary Clinton still enjoys dominant leads in general election polls. And there\u2019s no Sharia law anywhere to be found. So when reality doesn\u2019t confirm your crazy ideology, why not give it a little helpful push? Luckily, Goldberg was caught in time. Hopefully, the next conservative wacko doesn\u2019t fall through the cracks. Moulitsas is the founder and publisher of Daily Kos.","label":1}

Meanwhile, Carly Fiorina got a couple of weeks\u2019 mileage and a minor poll bump by indulging in outright fantasy about Planned Parenthood during one of the Republican presidential debates: \u201cWatch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says, \u2018We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.\u2019\u201d Maybe a Nazi cop could\u2019ve put a stop to it, if he hadn\u2019t been murdered by a Black Lives Matter activist! (And if Planned Parenthood were doing what Fiorina says it\u2019s doing, which it\u2019s not.) And heaven knows Christians just can\u2019t catch a break in this country anymore. \u201cChristian convictions are under attack as never before,\u201d claimed former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who\u2019s polling at 3 percent in the RealClearPolitics survey. \u201cNot just in our lifetime, but ever before in the history of this great nation. We are moving rapidly toward the criminalization of Christianity.\u201d But while Christians are under siege, Muslims are apparently running rampant in this country. \u201cWithout exaggeration, the Obama administration will become the world\u2019s leading state sponsor and financier of radical Islamic terrorism,\u201d said Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, yet another Republican vying for the presidential nomination next year, with maximum exaggeration. Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) actually accused Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton of conspiring with al Qaeda prior to the 2012 Benghazi consulate attack \u2014 on national TV \u2014 because that\u2019s the sort of nightmare America\u2019s conservatives live in. And then there are all the jobs the Obama administration has killed. The Environmental Protection Agency is killing jobs. ObamaCare is killing jobs. Investing in green energy is killing jobs. Our current Kenyan socialist communist president has killed so many jobs that no one has a job anymore. Sure, in the real world the economy set a record with 63 consecutive months of job growth, but don\u2019t try to let reality intrude into the conservative bubble. Their America is a hellhole, and they\u2019re sticking with their fantasy \u2019til the bitter end. Moulitsas is the founder and publisher of Daily Kos.","label":1}
{"text":"Budowsky: Obama, you\u2019re wrong about Sanders: \u00a9 Getty Images On Monday, President Obama scolded journalists for not covering the substance of the presidential campaign. I entirely agree. Where I disagree with the president is when he criticizes Bernie Sanders and his supporters, as well as Donald Trump, by saying: \u201cWhen people put their faith into someone who can\u2019t possibly deliver his or her own promises, that only breeds more cynicism.\u201d Obama is wrong \u2014 and insulting to voters \u2014 when he suggests that they need him or the media to determine whether they should put their faith in Sanders. Sanders supporters know exactly why they are supporting the Vermont senator. Sanders and his supporters believe \u2014 and I entirely agree \u2014 that Democrats should stand for powerful transforming change. They believe Democrats should mobilize armies of small donors and workers to support that change and should motivate more voters to come out on Election Day to elect more Democrats to the House and Senate, so that the party can negotiate with Republicans from a position of strength and a mandate for change. Obama and Democrats should consider with prayerful reflection why, since Obama became president, Democrats have lost control of the House, the Senate, governorships and state legislatures across the nation. It is fact, not opinion, that Democrats have suffered extreme damage at all levels during Obama\u2019s presidency, because too many Republican voters were motivated to vote and too many Democratic voters were not inspired and stayed home. Before Obama further insults the intelligence and idealism of Sanders supporters by suggesting he knows better than they do about which candidate they should put their faith in, he might consider this: The sum of all polling, according to RealClearPolitics, finds that Sanders would defeat every Republican opponent in a general election, would defeat Trump by an epic landslide margin of more than 17 percent and runs stronger than Hillary Clinton against all GOP opponents. My answer to Obama\u2019s speech to journalists is not that Democrats should support Sanders or Clinton, but that it is profoundly unwise and destructive to Democrats for the president to gratuitously criticize Sanders and insult those who put their faith in him. Regardless of who is nominated, Sanders is a major part of the solution to the challenges that Democrats face, and when Obama criticizes Sanders he becomes the problem, not the solution. Make no mistake, Hillary Clinton is the probable nominee for the Democratic Party, and if she is nominated I will work like hell to get her elected. But make no mistake about this, either: Bernie Sanders still has a chance to win a majority of elected delegates, and he and his supporters should be respected. Sanders has touched a chord in American politics. He speaks to the heart of many Democrats. He offers the conviction politics of authenticity and principle that Americans hunger for and find sorely lacking in politics today. He thrills young people, appeals to independents and attracts blue-collar workers who might otherwise be tempted by Trump. If Obama wants to help his party do better than it has done so far on his watch, while offering high praise to Clinton, he should speak of Sanders with respect and admiration, not condescension and contempt. If he wants to elect more Democrats to the House and Senate, he should sing the praises of Sanders for inspiring small donors to give him more than $43 million in February, and he should offer those small donors a standing ovation worthy of their great aspirations. Then, perhaps, they will donate to progressive Democrats running for the House and Senate regardless of who is nominated for president. For the same reasons that Sanders should avoid negative attacks against Clinton, Obama should avoid negative opining about Sanders and condescension toward his supporters, who bring enthusiasm, idealism and commitment to the cause that serves all Democrats and is as precious as gold to any nominee, whoever he or she may ultimately be.

{"text":"Markos Moulitsas: The real Obama\u2019s America: \u00a9 Getty Images Poor Donald Trump. Despite (or because of) being born into luxury and ease, his brain is simply wired wrong. It prevents him from performing simple tasks, like processing reality. That\u2019s why the real estate tycoon looks out his window and sees a dystopian hellhole. \u201cCrippled America\u201d screams the headline of his latest book, in which he promises to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d His first ad in Iowa featured a black-and white montage of the shooters in San Bernardino, Calif., body bags, missiles being launched from ships, buildings being destroyed by bombs, people swarming across a border and an ominous voice warning against terrorists and immigrants who are out to kill us. Trump is tickled when murderous fascists like Vladimir Putin f\u00eate him. He supports waterboarding even if it doesn\u2019t work because \u201cthey deserve it.\u201d He imagines hordes of African-Americans murdering white people. He thinks it\u2019s funny to mock Hillary Clinton for going to the bathroom. Trump had three young girls sing a campaign song at a rally with lyrics like \u201cPresident Donald Trump knows how to make America great! Deal from strength or get crushed every time!\u201d and \u201cEnemies of freedom, face the music! C\u2019mon boys! Take \u2019em down.\u201d Utterly creepy. And if Trump is president, every store will say \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d because apparently he plans to eliminate both the free exercise and free speech clauses of the First Amendment. So, given that Trump\u2019s America is a bombed-out husk of a dead civilization, it follows that it\u2019s President Obama\u2019s fault. \u201cThey\u2019re babies,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing ... it\u2019s so embarrassing.\u201d What\u2019s actually embarrassing is, well, Trump himself. The Obama administration has delivered affordable healthcare to almost 18 million formerly uninsured Americans and has added 13.7 million new jobs in seven years, compared to a laughable 1.3 million during George W. Bush\u2019s tenure. Diplomacy has thawed relations with Cuba and Iran. When two American gunboats were confiscated after drifting into Iranian waters, diplomacy resolved the issue in a matter of hours, to the GOP\u2019s chagrin. America can\u2019t be under siege if we\u2019re being civil to our enemies, can it? And there\u2019s that little matter of halting Iran\u2019s nuclear program. We\u2019ve seen al Qaeda decapitated and a marked decrease in terrorism-related deaths in the United States \u2014 101 during Obama\u2019s term, compared to 3,279 during Bush\u2019s. And despite conservative hysteria, the number of Americans killed by terrorists overseas between 2001 and 2013 was only 350. Every death is problematic, of course, which is why it\u2019s bizarre that Republicans don\u2019t care about the 406,496 people killed by firearms in the United States during that same period. Remember the Ebola panic? Republicans ripped into Obama for refusing to quarantine the entire nation and impose a travel ban. And then all of America died \u2014 didn\u2019t it? It\u2019s now easier to afford college, we\u2019ve begun the transition to a non-fossil-fuel economy, we\u2019re taking global climate change more seriously (because if Florida underwater isn\u2019t dystopian, what is?), there\u2019s greater oversight of Wall Street (though it could be tougher) and we are a far more tolerant and equal society today. Racists and bigots might hate that, but they are now the fringe minority. Is everything perfect in Obama\u2019s America? Of course not, and liberals can be just as critical of the president as conservatives. The difference is, our criticism is based on reality, not a trumped-up ideological fantasy.

{"text":"Dem PAC poll-tested attacks on Obama over father's Muslim heritage: A Democratic super PAC poll tested several personal attacks against then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) in 2008, including his cocaine use as a teenager and his father\u2019s Muslim heritage, according to emails released by WikiLeaks. The Jan. 9, 2008, email exchange is between Paul Begala, a longtime ally of Hillary Clinton, and her current campaign chairman, John Podesta. In it, Podesta provides a list of attack lines the strategists discussed putting into a survey. Begala, who now runs a super PAC backing Clinton's presidential bid, tweeted that the research was conducted on behalf of an \u201cindependent progressive\u201d political action committee led by an Obama supporter. He said the group also ran polling on potential attack lines against Clinton. The point of the polling, Begala said, was to determine the candidates\u2019 potential weaknesses ahead of the general election. The WikiLeaks emails indicate the super PAC also tested attack lines about Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), who ultimately won the GOP nomination that year. The email chain carried the subject line \u201cMcCain Survey- Take 3.\u201d The poll questions about Obama, as written in the emails, included: - Obama (owe-BAHM-uh)'s father was a Muslim and Obama grew up among Muslims in the world's most populous Islamic country.\" - Obama (owe-BAHM-uh) is ranked as one of the ten most liberal members of the Senate because of his support of issues like gay adoption.\" - Obama (owe-BAHM-uh) described his former use of cocaine as using \"a little blow.\" Conservative opposition research groups passed around the email highlighting the Muslim question. Tom Matzzie, the former Washington director for the liberal group MoveOn.org, said the poll was taken to see how voters responded to potential attacks against Clinton and Obama by Republicans. Those on the email were ready to defend whoever won the Democratic nomination, Begala said, as he did once Obama defeated Clinton in the primaries. Clinton\u2019s campaign has hammered her GOP rival, Donald Trump, for promoting doubts that President Obama was born in the U.S. and rejected Trump\u2019s assertion that she was responsible for fanning the racially charged rumor in 2008. In a Friday conference call with reporters, the Clinton campaign lashed out at WikiLeaks, calling the Russian hack of Podesta\u2019s emails an \u201cunprecedented and alarming attack\u201d on U.S. democracy meant to influence the election in favor of Trump. Clinton\u2019s team criticized Trump for his flattering comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin and ripped him for encouraging further cyberattacks that they say endanger the nation's sovereignty. The Clinton campaign has not confirmed or denied the authenticity of the Podesta emails. Spokesman Nick Merrill sought to cast doubt on the emails, though, saying they could have been manipulated.","label":0}
{"text":"Trump: Don't Take Money From Domestic Programs To Bloat The Military: Sponsor: The Hunger Site Trump wants to make cuts to essential programs that help citizens in need and give it to the military instead. Trump's campaign message was \"Make America great again,\" and most people thought he was referring to the country as a whole. But now that he's in office, it is becoming more obvious that was not his intention at all. Instead of putting more money into essential domestic programs (Environmental Protection Agency, education, job training, National Institutes of Health, Meals on Wheels), Trump wants to increase the defense budget for the military by $52.3 billion at the expense of vital domestic programs. In the America under this myopic budget, children at home will potentially have their educational programming taken away via PBS funding cuts, local communities could have toxic sites remain uncleaned thanks to the massive EPA cuts, and people will be much worse-off with significant cuts coming to the NIH which provide essential health-related research. In 2015, 13.1 million children lived in food insecure households, while 13 percent of all American households were considered food insecure. Just imagine what almost $53 billion could do for hungry children and families. The U.S. already spends obscene amounts of money on its defense program. In 2015, the country had a declared military and defense budget of $601 billion. Why should the military have more money when it could be spent on feeding U.S. citizens and giving our children a better education? If Trump truly wanted to \"Make America great again,\" he would know that requires reinvesting in America and its citizens! Trump needs to stop dwelling on the past and thinking a higher-funded military will somehow be the answer to all of our domestic problems. The U.S. cannot continue to spending money overseas when people are home are hungry and need better education. Sign to show your support for prioritizing domestic enrichment over war, poverty, and death! The Petition: Dear President Trump, You said you wanted to \"make America great again,\" but your new budget plan is actually taking money away from domestic programs that people rely on and you are giving that money to the military instead. Right now, our military is already spending more than the rest of the world by a massive margin. Is it really that important to keep pushing money into something that already has so much when people at home are suffering?","label":1}
{"text":"Disrespecting The National Anthem And The American Flag Are Not Legitimate Forms Of Political Protest:  This is going to backfire on the left in a major way. On Sunday, more than a hundred NFL players knelt during the playing of the national anthem. It was obviously an attempt to make some sort of public statement about President Trump, but it was an exceedingly poor way to go about doing that. Because our young people are not even taught about the importance of our national anthem and our national flag in school, most of these players didn\u2019t even understand what they were doing. Our anthem is sung and our flag is proudly displayed prior to major sporting events for a reason. The truth is that our national anthem and our national flag are both symbols that directly represent our nation. In other words, when you show disrespect to the anthem or to the flag you are literally showing disrespect to the United States of America. So what these players did on Sunday was essentially to spit in the face of every single American citizen. This is not just an American thing. All over the world it is well understood that respect for the national flag and other national symbols is not optional. What transpired at NFL games on Sunday will be broadcast all over the planet, and the rest of the world will be laughing at our national disgrace. The very first NFL game scheduled on Sunday was held in London, and \u201cdozens of players from both teams\u201d knelt while the national anthem was being played\u2026  The first game of the day between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars saw dozens of players from both teams kneel while almost the entire Jaguars\u2019 on-field and sideline players and employees locked arms during the U.S. national anthem, including owner Shahid Khan. Some players stood while others knelt.  And of course similar \u201csideline protests\u201d happened at other NFL stadiums all over the nation. Never before in American history have we ever seen anything quite like this\u2026  Demonstrations spread throughout the league as many players broke out of their routine by joining the protests or engaging in team-wide displays of unity. Several players from the Buffalo Bills, Denver Broncos, New York Giants, Detroit Lions, New England Patriots, New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons were among those who chose not to stand for the anthem. The Miami Dolphins, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Minnesota Vikings, Philadelphia Eagles, Chicago Bears, Indianapolis Colts, New York Jets, Los Angeles Chargers and Green Bay Packers stood with arms locked, though some players from those teams chose to kneel.  I honestly don\u2019t think that the NFL will ever be the same after this. It had already been transformed into the \u201cno fun league\u201d, and now the focus will squarely be on political protests rather than football for the foreseeable future. Needless to say, millions upon millions of Americans were completely disgusted by the disrespect shown to our national symbols on Sunday, and President Trump was one of them\u2026  \u201cIf a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect \u2026,\u201d Trump said in tweets Saturday afternoon. \u201cOur Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU\u2019RE FIRED. Find something else to do!\u201d  If professional football players want to speak out against President Trump, I have no problem with that whatsoever. But for them to openly and brazenly disrespect our entire country is crossing a line that should never be crossed. What in the world has happened to America? All over America high school football coaches are being banned from saying prayers before games, and yet disrespecting our anthem and our flag is somehow acceptable? The following comes from Zero Hedge\u2026  Marc Short, the president\u2019s legislative director, has also backed his boss, telling \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that a double standard for players who chose to voice their views on the field, and that the president was speaking for the majority of Americans on what sort of expression was appropriate. Short compared a crackdown on protests to the ban on high school football coaches leading players in prayer before games. \u201cThere are high school coaches across America today who are punished for leading their players in prayer, and yet, when an N.F.L. player takes a knee, somehow that player is presumed to be a martyr for a social cause,\u201d Mr. Short said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cThe president is standing with the vast majority of Americans who believe that our flag should be respected.\u201d  Many of these players are going to look back on what they have done with great shame. They may have believed that they were disrespecting President Trump, but the truth is that they were disrespecting this great land and every single American that has ever lived. They owe all of us an apology, and that should happen as soon as possible. And the NFL may think that it is all powerful, but stunts like this are going to cost it millions upon millions of dollars. Already, ratings were way down because of the few players that were kneeling whenever the anthem was played\u2026  Player protests of the National Anthem \u2013 such as when quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee in protest \u2013 are the number one reason sports fans watched fewer National Football League (NFL) games, a new survey shows.  If just a few players kneeling had that much of an impact on the ratings, what do you think is going to happen now? Unfortunately, I have a feeling that this is just the beginning. In fact, one former Democratic member of Congress is calling on all NFL players to kneel while the anthem is played\u2026  A former Democrat Congresswoman has called for every NFL player to kneel during the national anthem at Sunday\u2019s games, while branding President Donald Trump a \u2018white supremacist\u2019. Donna Edwards, who retired as a US representative for Maryland earlier this year, issued the bold statement on Saturday, responding to Trump\u2019s criticism of NFL players who refuse to stand for the anthem. \u2018On Sunday, I hope every @NFL player takes a knee in solidarity w [Colin Kaepernick] against the white supremacist who squats in our White House,\u2019 Edwards said in reference to the former San Francisco quarterback, who is now a free agent.  No matter what your political perspective is, it is wrong to disrespect our national anthem and it is wrong to disrespect our flag. And anyone that disrespects our anthem and our flag is spitting in the face of the entire country. What happened on Sunday was a national disgrace, and those involved need to apologize to the American people immediately.

{"text":"Zakir Naik: What have I done to earn 'terror preacher' tag?: NEW DELHI: Controversial Islamic preacher Zakir Naik, in an open letter to Indians, has claimed that he was being targetted for being a popular figure among Muslims and that demonising him was part of a larger 'conspiracy' to attack the community. Naik + is under the scanner of Indian investigative agencies for allegedly inspiring terrorists with his speeches. Stating that his Islamic Research Foundation + ( IRF) and he had been \"set up\" for a ban, \"never mind the lack of evidence\", he accused the government of using \"desperate measures to kill peace and harmony\". Putting a set of five questions to his fellow citizens, Naik wondered why he was being labelled a \"terror preacher\" now when he had been delivering speeches on Islam for the past 25 years. He also claimed that fresh probes were being undertaken against him and his NGO IRF despite past investigations having found no conclusive evidence of any wrongdoing on their part. Raising the recent renewal of IRF's foreign funding licence, followed by revoking of the renewal and suspension of four home ministry officers, Naik asked if this was because the renewal was \"against the laid down agenda of the government?\". \"Why would you suspend FCRA officials? Is it because they did things by the book?\" he asked. The televangelist sought to question the \"selective leaking of government documents to the media\". \"The one and only investigation report submitted till now remains inconclusive, but the solicitor general's 'judgment' of banning IRF and I was duly leaked....Is this how IRF will be banned? By creating an atmosphere of ban? Rather than rely on proofs and evidences?\" he asked. Also countering the allegations of forced conversions against him and the IRF, Naik dared the government to produce the converted person along with the statement about \"how he or she was forcibly converted\". \"Isn't this the most basic proof of forced conversion? The fact is, there never was forced conversion,\" he argued. Stating that he had been preaching for 25 years, Naik said the move to act against him was part of a deeper agenda to attack Indian Muslims. \"What exactly did I do now to earn the tags of 'terror preacher', 'Dr. Terror' and 'hate monger'? Of 150 countries where I'm respected and my talks are welcomed, I'm being called a terrorist influence in my own country. What an irony. Why now, when I've been doing the same thing for over 25 years?\" he asked. \"If IRF and I are banned, it will be biggest jolt to the country's democracy...this ban will set a precedence of unspeakable injustices against the 20 crore Muslims of India. This action will embolden and encourage every fringe element in the country to do as they please. If you thought intolerance increased in the country recently, this action of the government will take it to an all-time high,\" he alleged. We recommend this video for youWMG INTERNATIONAL INC TAP TO WATCH Stating that he had tried to stay away from the spotlight trained on him following claims by two terrorists behind the July 1 attack in Dhaka that they were inspired by his speeches, Naik said he felt it best to continue with his work and not pay attention to his detractors. \"But I soon realised that this time it was different. there was much greater media involvement, and a much deeper government's involvement,\" he alleged. In an appeal to Indians, Naik, who is currently abroad, pleaded: \"If you find any wrongdoing on my part, punish me by all means....I'm open to any investigation.\" \"To all, my appeal is do not allow subversion of the Constitution. My appeal to the government - be fair in your investigation. Be fair in what you allege. Be truthful with facts,\" he added.

At 6\u2032 8\u2033, James Comey is going under. A whistleblower reported last year that the National Security Agency (NSA) was in possession of Hillary Clinton\u2019s deleted emails. With the corruption and lawlessness inside the Obama administration, the existence of those emails was a jealously guarded secret. Now it is being reported that FBI director James Comey was offered those emails by the NSA \u2014 and he refused them, obviously to keep the likely very incriminating evidence out of the case he was charged with investigating impartially. The swamp gets deeper. Numerous reports coming out of the Senate Judiciary Committee last week said that former Comey made the decision not to refer Clinton for prosecution long before he even interviewed key witnesses, including Hillary. The New York Post reports new bombshell under the umbrella headline \u201cProof that investigating Trump is starting to backfire for Democrats,\u201d which also reminds us that Comey chastised Clinton harshly on TV before recommending that she not be prosecuted. Post author John Crudele adds:  Comey fibbed when he said his agents unanimously agreed that prosecution was unnecessary. In fact, my source says that FBI agents were irate about the decision not to go after Clinton. The controversy got pretty intense, which may be why Comey forced agents who worked on the Clinton matter to sign additional nondisclosure agreements.

{"text":"Moulitsas: Comey\u2019s empty letter: \u00a9 Francis Rivera Conspiracy-minded, fact-challenged conservatives have whipped themselves into a lather of a narrative about Hillary Clinton, one that demands she be jailed immediately for ... something. You want reasons? She supposedly helped Bill Clinton cover up rape, helped another rapist beat the rap, stole money from the Clinton Foundation, willfully caused the death of State Department personnel in Benghazi, made deals with our enemies as secretary of State to enrich her family, and endangered national security by sending emails from a private server \u2014 one, incidentally, that wasn\u2019t hacked by Russian intelligence. And maybe, just maybe, one of those will be validated by reality. Worth a shot, right? In truth, there is zero evidence to support any of those allegations despite the best efforts of the entire conservative movement and much of the media. If the Clinton Foundation suffered a fraction of the problems of Trump\u2019s, the media outrage would be deafening, yet not a single instance of quid pro quo has been unearthed. Seven Republican investigations into the Benghazi, Libya, terror attacks found nothing. So, they became probes of her emails, hoping to find something, anything, to pin on her. Unfortunately for them, there was nothing incriminating, illegal, or untoward. Nothing. So now, during an unrelated investigation into scumbag Anthony Weiner, the FBI may have found something of relevance, but who knows? We\u2019ll just make a big announcement, so that everyone can assume the worst of Clinton, yet again, without a single fact to buttress the hysteria. And really, what could possibly be in those emails that would justify this witch-hunt atmosphere? Emails to al Qaeda giving them directions to our facility in Benghazi? Of course, there\u2019s zero interest in the truth. Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt said the FBI should only comment further on those new emails if anything of substance is found. Otherwise, clearing Clinton yet again would only be perceived as \u201crigging\u201d the election. Very convenient. She\u2019s guilty if she did it, guilty if she didn\u2019t. But then again, how is that different than the GOP\u2019s decades-long crusade against her? And even if those emails prove to be innocuous and irrelevant, we can probably expect a new round of investigations into Clinton aide Huma Abedin\u2019s use of different computers to access her emails. Because, you know, if you at first don\u2019t succeed, try, try again. Meanwhile, as FBI Director James Comey stokes the anti-Clinton cause with selective leaks, he refuses to comment on something of real substance: the apparent link between Russia and the Trump campaign. Or as Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) wrote in a letter to the director, \u201cin my communications with you \u2026 it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisers, and the Russian government \u2014 a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States.\u201d Yet at least one source told CNBC that Comey has refused to publicly reveal that information for fear of affecting the election. Or, more aptly, for fear of affecting Trump\u2019s electoral chances. Of course, this is all Sturm und Drang, as few if any minds are being changed. People are locked into their partisan preferences, and no new Trump tapes or Clinton emails will change any votes. The choices of our electorate are baked in. But that won\u2019t stop Republicans from continuing their witch hunt once Clinton is in office, no matter how lacking any evidence might be.

(Photo, Kyle Melnick, Diamondback) COLLEGE PARK, Md. (ABC7) \u2014 Multiple members of the University of Maryland's student marching band appeared to kneel during the National Anthem before Maryland's game against Northwestern on Saturday. Kyle Melnick, a Maryland student and reporter for the Diamondback, the school's student newspaper, got pictures of a few members of the \"Mighty Sound of Maryland\" kneeling during the anthem before the Terrapins' game against the Wildcats. The act of demonstrating during the anthem gained major attention in the 2016 NFL preseason after then San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat during the anthem as a protest of police discrimination against people of color. Kaepernick then began kneeling during the anthem as the season progressed. Others at multiple levels of sports followed his example, either kneeling, sitting or raising a fist during the song. The movement has grown even larger in 2017 after President Donald Trump proposed firing any NFL players who kneeled during the anthem. No Maryland football players have been seen kneeling this season. Earlier in the year, the band made the decision to stop playing the state song \"Maryland My Maryland\" because of its \"pro-Confederate\" tone.","label":0}
{"text":"President Trump lauds Houston's Mattress Mack in Values Voter Summit speech: During remarks Friday morning at the annual Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C. the president lauded Houston's Jim \"Mattress Mack\" McIngvale for his work in the wake of Hurricane Harvey through his Gallery Furniture stores. Trump was the first sitting president to speak at the summit in its history, although he spoke twice in years past before he was actually elected president. The event, which began in 2006, is hosted by the Family Research Council. The president began his speech touching on the mass shooting in Las Vegas, the California wildfires, and the devastation left by the the hurricanes that have battered the United States and its territories. He also spoke out about his appointment of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch his first ten months in office and the \"war\" on Christmas. Perhaps the line of the day was Trump's hard stance on government versus religion. \"In America we don't worship government, we worship God,\" President Trump said. Trump's speech turned to the resolve of the American people, first mentioning a young Las Vegas cop named Brady Cook, who injured in the Las Vegas shooting on his second day of service. The president then brought up \"Mattress Mack\" and his work aiding in the Hurricane Harvey. \"When the rain began to flood the streets of the city he sent out his furniture trucks to rescue the stranded,\" Trump said. \"He brought them back to his stores and gave them food and a clean, dry place to stay even if it meant ruining countless dollars worth of furniture.\" RELATED: After his Harvey contributions, petition for 'Mattress Mack Day' reaches 140,000 signatures McIngvale was a supporter and donor to Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. In April 2015, at an event sponsored by and benefitting The Woodlands-based Texas Patriots PAC, Mr. Trump spoke onstage with the Houston business icon, who arguably had the loudest audience reaction. Trump spoke about how he's always asked how he has so much energy and answers by saying that everyone eventually \"gets to sleep for a very long time.\" To which McIngvale responded, \"I can get you a good mattress for that.\" Video of the talk between the future president and McIngvale can be found here online at Gallery Furniture's Vimeo video page.","label":0}
{"text":"Trump makes America hate, not great: \u00a9 Getty Images Not since the days of the racist governors of the segregationist South has any American politician so embodied values that are alien to the American idea as Donald Trump does today. In the America that true patriots love, we are a large and diverse nation of immigrants that came from around the world to build a special place where all people should be treated as equal in a national community of mutual respect and shared purpose. In the America that the Republican presidential front-runner would create, our republic would become a sectarian war zone. Our democracy would become a place where those with different views would be treated as enemies ruled by a bully who campaigns on a cult of negativity and has recently been called liar of the year by a nationally respected fact-checker. In the America envisioned by Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, young women could be proud to vote for the first female president. In the America envisioned by Trump, a woman running for the Republican nomination can be demeaned for having a face that the bully considers ugly, and a highly respected television host can be called a bimbo. In the America envisioned by Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, our country would be a place where justice rules the day and economic fairness becomes a way of life. In the America envisioned by Trump, when a black man is beaten up at a rally filled with the politics of dog-whistle bigotry, the candidate suggests that perhaps that man deserved the beating. In the America envisioned by John McCain \u2014 and his father and grandfather before \u2014 words such as duty, honor, country and service are a family tradition. McCain, a hero of modern American history, defied his captors in Vietnam and let these true enemies of America continue to torture him because he refused to be released until all of his brother POWs were released by his side. All the while, Trump collected draft deferments on his way to becoming a bully who campaigns to be commander in chief by demeaning POWs as losers, because the man who never served prefers troops who were never captured. In the America we love, young people are taught that Lady Liberty will always shine brightly in New York Harbor. In the America that Trump envisions, the lie that the Mexican government sends immigrants to America is compounded by the slander that those Hispanic immigrants are mostly rapists and murderers. In the America that is great, we were raised by our parents and taught in the houses of worship of many faiths to do unto others as we would wish others do unto us. In the America that would be ruled by the bully, moms and dads of disabled girls and boys must worry their children might inadvertently witness disgusting impersonations of the disabled on television by a man who dares to presume he is worthy to lead the nation while he seeks to lower the standards of our politics to the gutter. Throughout the nobler moments of our history, Americanism was embodied and defended by men and women from all backgrounds with all points of view who believed that in this land we love, America is a place where we are all in this together. That concept is alien to Trump\u2019s politics, which makes Trump\u2019s ambition alien to the spirit of America. The Americans who defeated fascism in wartime did not consider their comrades in arms or the united nation behind them to be fat slobs, bimbos, rapists, murderers, idiots or morons, or disabled Americans worthy of being demeaned by a clown who is unfit to be a commander. Donald Trump has more in common with the neofascist parties in Europe than with any great party that has ever led our nation. He would not make America great. He would make America hate.

{"text":"Huma Abedin's ties to the Muslim Brotherhood: To view this page ensure that Adobe Flash Player version 10.2.0 or greater is installed. The Clinton campaign is attempting once again to sweep important questions under the rug about top aide Huma Abedin, her family ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and to Saudi Arabia, and her role in the ballooning Clinton email scandal. The New York Post ran a detailed investigative piece over the weekend about Ms. Abedin\u2019s work at the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs from 1995 through 2008, a Sharia law journal whose editor in chief was Abedin\u2019s own mother. This is not some accidental association. Ms. Abedin was, for many years, listed as an associate editor of the London-based publication and wrote for the journal while working as an intern in the Clinton White House in the mid-1990s. Her mother, Saleha Abedin, sits on the Presidency Staff Council of the International Islamic Council for Da\u2019wa and Relief, a group that is chaired by the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi. Perhaps recognizing how offensive such ties will be to voters concerned over future terrorist attacks on this country by radical Muslims professing allegiance to Sharia law, the Clinton campaign on Monday tried to downplay Ms. Abedin\u2019s involvement in the Journal and the Muslim Brotherhood. The Clinton surrogate group Media Matters claimed predictably there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that Ms. Abedin or her family had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, and that Trump campaign staffers who spoke of these ties were conspiracy theorists. To debunk the evidence, Media Matters pointed to a Snopes.com \u201cfact-check\u201d piece that cited as its sole source\u2026 Senator John McCain. This is the same John McCain who met Libyan militia leader Abdelkarim Belhaj, a known al Qaeda associate, and saluted him as \u201cmy hero\u201d during a 2011 visit to Benghazi. Senator McCain and others roundly criticized Rep. Michele Bachmann in 2012 when she and four members of the House Permanent Select Committee Intelligence and the House Judiciary Committee cited Ms. Abedin in letters sent to the Inspectors General of the Department of Defense, Department of State, Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, warning about Muslim Brotherhood infiltration of the United States government. In response to those critiques, Rep. Bachmann laid out the evidence in a 16-page memo, which has never been refuted by Senator McCain or the elite media. The evidence, in my opinion, is overwhelming: Huma Abedin is nothing short of a Muslim Brotherhood princess, born into an illustrious family of Brotherhood leaders. Her father, Syed Zaynul Abedin, was a professor in Saudi Arabia who founded the Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs, an institution established by the Government of Saudi Arabia with the support of the Muslim World League. The Muslim World League was \u201cperhaps the most significant Muslim Brotherhood organization in the world,\u201d according to former federal prosecutor Andrew C. McCarthy. Its then-General Secretary, Umar Nasif, founded the Rabita Trust, \u201cwhich is formally designated as a foreign terrorist organization under American law due to its support of al Qaeda,\u201d he wrote. That is not guilt by association but what federal prosecutors would call a \u201cnexus\u201d of like-minded people who shared the same goals. A Saudi government document inspired by Ms. Abedin\u2019s father explains the concept of \u201cMuslim Minority Affairs,\u201d the title of the Journal Mr. Abedin founded, and its goal to \u201cestablish a global Sharia in our modern times.\u201d Simply put, Huma Abedin worked for thirteen years as part of an enterprise whose explicit goal was to conquer the West in the name of Islam. No wonder the Clinton campaign wants to sweep this issue under the rug. Mrs. Clinton has sometimes referred to Huma Abedin as her \u201csecond daughter.\u201d Whether it was because of their close relationship or for some other reason, Mrs. Clinton has done much to further the Muslim Brotherhood agenda while Secretary of State, and can be counted on doing more as president. As Secretary of State, she relentlessly pushed the overthrow of Libyan leader Mohammar Qaddafi, a dire enemy of the Brotherhood, even when President Obama and his Secretary of Defense were reluctant to go to war. Along with Obama, she pushed for the overthrow of Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak and his replacement by Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammad Morsi. She pushed for direct U.S. involvement in the Syrian civil war, including the arming of Syrian rebels allied with al Qaeda. As I reveal in my new book, she worked side by side with the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the umbrella group where 57 majority Muslim states pushed their agenda of imposing Sharia law on the non-Muslim world, to use hate crime laws in the United States to criminalize speech critical of Islam, in accordance with United Nations Resolution 16\/18. Their first victim in the United States was a Coptic Christian named Nakoula Bassiley Nakoula, the maker of the YouTube video Hillary and Obama blamed for Benghazi. New Abedin emails released to Judicial Watch this week show that Huma Abedin served as liaison between Clinton Foundation donors, including foreign governments, and the State Department. When foreign donors had difficult in getting appointments with Mrs. Clinton through normal State Department channels, Clinton Foundation executive Douglas Band would email Huma Abedin, and poof! the doors would open as if by magic. Donald Trump has criticized this as \u201cpay for play.\u201d But it also raises questions as to whether Huma Abedin and Mrs. Clinton were in fact serving as unregistered agents for foreign powers who sought to impose their anti-freedom agenda on the United States. The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization in 2014. But by then, the damage had been done. Do Americans want eight years of a President Clinton, who will do even more to empower the Muslim Brotherhood and impose its agenda on America? Timmerman is a Donald Trump supporter.

{"text":"Germany's crackdown over online hate speech reaches Mark Zuckerberg: Mark Zuckerberg is under investigation in Germany. Germany's fight against hate speech has reached Mark Zuckerberg himself. A German prosecutor has named Zuckerberg, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and European Facebook executives in a preliminary investigation, according to German media. The investigation was prompted by a lawsuit filed by Chan-jo Jun, an attorney who filed a similar complaint a year ago. This one, which said that Facebook failed to remove hate speech even once it was aware of the violations of German law, singled out Zuckerberg by name. \u201cWe are not commenting on the status of a possible investigation but we can say that the allegations lack merit and there has been no violation of German law by Facebook or its employees,\" Facebook said in a statement. \"There is no place for hate on Facebook. We work closely with partners to fight hate speech and foster counter speech.\u201c The investigation and lawsuit are tied to a broader crackdown against online hate speech. A German justice minister said earlier this week that Facebook and Twitter would both be required to improve their responses to hate speech or face legal action, the Associated Press reported. Germany has strict laws surrounding hate speech. The laws, a result of Germany's history, protect minority groups from incitement to hatred or harassment. While Germany's hate speech laws single out anti-Semitism, the issue has come to public attention recently over speech targeted at the wave of refugees entering Germany. A study over the summer found that Facebook removed 46 percent of posts flagged as hate speech and Twitter removed 1 percent, the AP said. That's not enough for Germany. In the United States, Twitter is usually the social network to earn criticism for its lack of response to hate speech. Facebook, meanwhile, is more often called out for censorship. German media didn't mention any Twitter executives named in an investigation.","label":0}
{"text":"Memo to all weak-kneed Republicans: Get a grip: \u00a9 Getty Images Oh, horrors! Oh, shocking! Oh, lewd, lewd, lewd! Spare me. What\u2019s really shocking is the smarmy sanctimonious hypocrisy of it all. It\u2019s comical to watch the drama coming from Democrats in response to the 11-year old \u201chot mic\u201d incident with Donald Trump. Democrats who defended a President who admitted to receiving oral sex from an intern in the Oval Office while discussing bombing runs against Serbia, and who think it\u2019s just hunky-dory to put boys in the Girls\u2019 locker room in public schools But Republicans? Really? Senators Mike Lee and his ilk (who, let\u2019s not forget, have long been #NeverTrumpers), climbing high on their sanctimonious horse to say Trump\u2019s comments were just about the worst thing that\u2019s ever been said about women? Puh-leese. As Charles Krauthammer so cogently pointed out on Fox News the evening the scandal broke, if you thought Donald Trump was a saint, you haven\u2019t been paying attention. Any Republican with an ounce of political savvy should understand that Hillary\u2019s playbook is all about impugning Donald Trump\u2019s character. That is all she\u2019s got. Because if she ran on the issues \u2014 her secret endorsement of open borders, for example \u2013 she would go down in flames. It\u2019s time our party got a collective grip on itself. Tony Perkins and Ralph Reed, two responsible evangelical leaders, got it just right in their comments. Here\u2019s what Perkins, who heads the Family Research Council, said:  \"My personal support for Donald Trump has never been based upon shared values, it is based upon shared concerns about issues such as: justices on the Supreme Court that ignore the constitution, America\u2019s continued vulnerability to Islamic terrorists and the systematic attack on religious liberty that we\u2019ve seen in the last 7 1\/2 years.\u201d  To the Mike Lee\u2019s, Kelly Ayotte\u2019s, Mia Love\u2019s, and Paul Ryan\u2019s out there: have you forgotten why we elected you in the first place? Have you forgotten why the Tea Party exploded onto the political scene in 2010, and why Donald Trump succeeded in roundly defeating 16 highly-qualified and highly-skilled Republican opponents in the primary? A movement has sprung up in this country, and the political elites are terrified that it will succeed in pushing the eject button on their cozy Party of Big Government that has ruled, raped, and destroyed this country for too long. Republican and Independent voters are undoubtedly smarter than the Mike Lee\u2019s, Kelly Ayotte\u2019s and the rest of them. These voters understand that the Movement will ultimately triumph, and that they will never go silent again until it does. They will elect Donald Trump and Mike Pence because they know that this is our last chance to keep our nation from plunging over the cliff into an abyss of debt, weakness, and servitude. They know that an election victory by Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine will mean a bigger, more expensive, more intrusive federal government, higher taxes, and a diminished U.S. military. They know that a Hillary victory will mean America will continue to \u201clead from behind,\u201d the \u201cpolicy\u201d Hillary touted as such a huge success in Libya, even as America\u2019s enemies continue to attack us and get away with it unopposed. What part of \u201cdefeat\u201d do Mike Lee and Kelly Ayotte fail to understand? I\u2019m not talking a defeat of Donald Trump. I\u2019m talking about the defeat of the America most of us still love and cherish. To repeat: nobody ever thought that Donald Trump was a saint. That was never his qualification for office. The reason Donald Trump is the only Republican qualified to become the next president is because he is the only one who understood early \u2014 and continues to articulate \u2014 the broad-based popular movement of Americans who are determined to stop the theft of our nation by the political and media elites.

{"text":"Believe the victims \u2014 unless they're Bill's: \u00a9 Getty Images The dominating issue of last Friday\u2019s debates could have (and probably should have) been ISIS, ObamaCare, or the economy. Instead, the audience was practically water-boarded with sex scandals. Even the moderators persisted in asking Donald Trump about a 2005 video of him making lewd comments about women. The media, liberals, and all of your anti-Trump Facebook friends have been absolutely obsessed with this recording. In effort to take some heat off of himself, Trump brought Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, and Juanita Broaddrick to that debate. The one thing all of these women have in common is that they\u2019ve accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault. What\u2019s that? Bill isn\u2019t running for the White House? If you honestly believe the Clintons haven\u2019t been working as one well-oiled machine since the 1970s, then I have a casino to sell to you. It\u2019s absolutely important that the media covers Trump\u2019s offensive words and accusers. But journalists are showing their bias by refusing to give fair coverage to the Clintons\u2019 alleged actions. Why won\u2019t the left, including Hillary, live up to her own standards? And more importantly, why won\u2019t the press? Trump\u2019s words are offensive, but the alleged actions of Bill Clinton are extremely disturbing. As such, even though he is not running for office, it\u2019s fair to ask what it means that Hillary would stand by such a man \u2014 for such a long time \u2014 when these sorts of accusations have dogged him every step of the way. And again, even though he\u2019s not running for office, a win for Hillary puts Bill back in the White House, and back on the largest stage imaginable. \"Believe the victims,\" shouts the feminist-left, often from their Twitter accounts. Hillary Clinton has even raised her voice with theirs, tweeting: \"You have the right to be believed, and we're with you.\u201d Unfortunately for Hillz, Broaddrick, the woman who accused Bill Clinton of rape in 1978, also took to Twitter in effort to keep her accusation alive. As you may have guessed, Hillary\u2019s original tweet was deleted shortly after. With so many on the left claiming that all sexual assault victims deserve to be believed, why then aren\u2019t the numerous women who Bill Clinton allegedly sexually assaulted treated with respect or seriousness in the mainstream media? Instead these women are dismissed or even worse, slut-shamed by the usual talking heads. Even though it seemed distasteful to many viewers for Trump to trot these alleged victims out as props for the debate, sitting them in the front row as heartbreaking reminders of the evil that men can do to women, at least it kept them in the discussion. Much like Bill Cosby, if properly investigated and given the attention such claims deserve, a snowball effect might occur with more women coming forward. But maybe that\u2019s exactly why these charges continue to be ignored. The human brain is a pattern-making machine. After a predator selects a victim for the first time, whether what follows takes the form of an ill-intentioned seduction or full-on sexual assault, the predator\u2019s brain learns one of two things from the result: If caught and punished, the brain learns a lesson. If there are no tangible consequences, the predator has no reason to reform. Serial abusers of women will continue to act with impunity as long as they have no reason to think they\u2019ll be punished. Those women seated in the front row of that debate hall were a reminder that if guilty of their alleged crimes, Bill has not learned the right lesson. He would\u2019ve never had to. And if you believe these accusers you would have to agree that for her part, Hillary has obviously never insisted that her husband be held accountable. That, on its own, is enough to call her judgment and morals into question. Kristin Tate is a conservative columnist and author of the book \"Government Gone Wild: How D.C.

{"text":"Sick Liberal Teacher Tweets Disgusting 4-Word Message For Las Vegas Shooting Victims: After more than 50 have been reported dead and hundreds wounded, a liberal teacher and vehement anti-Trump activist took to Twitter to offer a solitary \u201cprayer\u201d for the Las Vegas shooting victims. However, once viewers read the 4 horrific words she wrote, they were sickened that a woman so depraved could be teaching their children. While civilians are still dying after the deadliest mass shooting in American history, a liberal teacher offered 4 sickening words for the victims. (Photo credit: Twitter, Ethan Miller\/Getty Images) When mass murders occur in the U.S., the liberals cross their fingers in the hope that the killer isn\u2019t a devout Muslim terrorist. If the killer appears to be non-Muslim, the left immediately propagates that it must be a right-wing white nationalist. Disturbingly, their hope that they can blame peaceful conservatives is only outweighed by their cowardly support for such depraved mass murderers as one teacher openly pointed out. According to Information Liberation, a woman identified only by the Twitter name @TheResistANNce publicly called for followers to \u201cpray\u201d that only Trump supporters were among the 50+ fatalities of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino shooting, requesting that viewers \u201cpray only trumptards died.\u201d Even more disturbing is that the Twitter user is allegedly a teacher, although her identity and location are unknown. An unidentified liberal \u201cteacher\u201d celebrated the Las Vegas shooting by calling for followers to pray that only Trump supporters would die. (Photo credit: Twitter) The Columbia Bugle brought attention to the woman\u2019s despicable support for mass murder before the user deleted her account.  \u201cVery disturbing that this woman is a teacher,\u201d commented the Columbia Bugle. \u201cTragic that a woman as sick as her is teaching young minds.\u201d  Still, the self-described teacher wasn\u2019t the only liberal who hopes that Trump supporters and white people were slaughtered at the event, according to Info Wars.  Another Twitter user lauded the massacre by tweeting, \u201cShooting at country music festival in Las Vegas?! Looks like revenge on those Trump supporters.\u201d A user then replied, \u201cdud slayed\u201d and \u201ckill, kill, kill, especially the white man,\u201d along with a series of skulls and laughing emojis. \u201cI hope they killed more than 25 Trump supporters lol,\u201d tweeted another.  When liberals weren\u2019t expressing their support for the shooter, they were attempting to spin the attack for their own narrative. Piers Morgan tweeted, \u201cIf the shooter was Muslim, we\u2019d call this a terrorist attack.\u201d He then spread false news that the shooting was undoubtedly a terror attack by a \u201cwhite American,\u201d despite the fact that authorities have not yet come forward with any suspected motive and that Muslims can also be white Americans. Additionally, for an attack to be considered a terror attack, the attacker must have a political motivation, just like when Muslims commit acts of violence in support of Islamic Sharia law. The truth of the matter is that suspect Stephen Craig Paddock used an illegal firearm in a liberal gun-free zone and, so far, according to his family and authorities has no political affiliation. Whether he was a recent Muslim convert, as ISIS claims, or just a deranged, evil man who had an unnatural bloodlust, the truth still stands that the left is more closely related to mass murderers than any Second-Amendment-supporting, freedom-loving, conservative American, as they continue to prove with their sadistic tweets. Perhaps telling about Paddock\u2019s possible motivation is linked to his live-in \u201ccompanion\u2019s\u201d tendency to fall for far-left anti-Trump liberals. Paddock\u2019s partner, Marilou Danley, is still married to Geary Danley, whose social media profile showcases his hatred for Trump and conservatives and his unwavering support for progressive liberalism. The truth of the matter is that you\u2019re more likely to be killed by a devout leftist, or Muslim for that matter, than by a gun-toting conservative hillbilly. Of course, the liberals who delight in such evil acts of violence but are too cowardly to actually commit one themselves are hiding behind social media accounts, applauding and drooling over the possibility of Americans dying for simply having a different opinion.","label":1}
{"text":"He Had No Business Becoming President: As a Democrat, I have no reservation saying that America needs a strong Republican Party. We live in a two-party system and there are very real policy debates that we should be having. With that said, this Republican Party is failing themselves and failing Americans as a whole at resembling anything close to a major political party. Let\u2019s be honest for a minute. Republican support of Donald Trump is clearly less about Trump and more about former President Obama. It\u2019s a guttural reaction. As hard as Republicans may have tried, they have been completely unable to erase our first black president from the history books. It tears them up inside that a smart, cocky, black man beat them at their own game, twice. He stopped the world economy from crashing. He eased our fears during national tragedies, and whether we liked everything about the ACA or not, he tried his best to give more people access to health care. All with a smile. Not because he was happy with the way it all played out, but because that\u2019s what presidents are supposed to do \u2015 act presidential. As president, Obama recognized that he represented all Americans, even the ones who didn\u2019t vote for him. He recognized that he was not bigger than the office of the presidency. He knew that he owed the office a high level of respect. More importantly, though, he realized that our children were watching. A concept unfathomable to the current occupant of the Oval Office. President Obama recognized that generations of politicians, teachers, civic leaders, and yes, children, would take their cues from how he behaved as president. Instead of engaging in Twitter battles or attacking the character of his detractors, he gracefully ignored their criticism and stood tall against a party determined to beat HIM. He acted presidential, imagine that. My Republican friends should take note because what they\u2019re supporting, either directly or indirectly, isn\u2019t just an anti-Obama presidency but an anti-American president. Supporting a president who is uninterested, unprepared, and unwilling to learn from his mistakes isn\u2019t just overtly political, it\u2019s immoral. At some point, you are the company you keep. (Let me unapologetically digress and say that if Republicans are offended that they\u2019re constantly being called racist by Democrats, stop palling around with racists; it\u2019s not that complicated. If you consistently find yourself on the side of the racist, if you consistently find yourself defending racists, if you consistently find yourself making excuses for racists, you may not be a racist, but you certainly look like one. If that hurts your feelings, that\u2019s too bad, this is me abandoning political correctness. That\u2019s what you wanted, right?) There is no tax break in the world that can justify supporting a man who continues to lie to the American people with no hesitation. There\u2019s no level that unemployment can fall to that should justify the disrespect that this man has shown to each and every one of us. The end will never justify the means, ever. Instead of being honest with themselves and with the American people, Republicans have chosen to be complicit and engage in a level of intellectual dishonesty, and that isn\u2019t just disgusting, it\u2019s dangerous. Deep down we all know that there is nothing about Donald Trump that is admirable. There is nothing about Donald Trump that is redeemable. He is a con-artist and a fraud. He worships at the altar of greed, lies like it\u2019s going out of style, and sees apologizing as a sign of weakness. He is everything our parents told us not to embrace. At some point though, the bottom will fall out of this president\u2019s poll numbers, taking the rest of the Republican Party with him. Not even this brand of corporate cowards can save this administration. It will be at that point and only at that point that Republicans will admit publicly what many have said to me privately, \u201cHe had no business becoming president.\u201d A fact that has been obvious from the moment he emerged from his golden tower. A fact that privately, few Republicans deny. When that happens, let me be the first to say that there is nothing courageous about publicly coming to that conclusion. There is a clear difference between political courage and political expediency. The first is how Republicans should have acted during the election and the second is how they actually acted. Like a mathematician, Republicans made a calculation that party was more important than country. They decided that attempting to erase our first black president from the history books was more important than any other pressing issue. The more I engage with Republicans post-election, the more I realize how badly they are still reeling from their loss to President Obama in 2008. The more I realize that they are stuck in a time warp reminiscent of a 1980s movie with no path or plan to move America forward. The problem with that realization is that we\u2019re not in a movie, this is real life and these decisions have consequences. If Republicans can\u2019t figure out a way to lead, it\u2019s time for Americans to replace them with someone who can. Someone who can restore faith in government and civility into our national dialogue. Someone respectable. Someone other than the current group of politicians who can\u2019t get over 2008.","label":1}
{"text":"Hillary, Soros and the political genocide of Christianity: \u00a9 Getty Images Hillary Clinton seems to have a problem with religious liberty when it conflicts with her progressive goals. During an April 2015 speech to the Women in the World Conference she said, \u201cDeep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed\u201d for the sake of giving women access to \u201creproductive health care and safe childbirth.\u201d Translated, that means that Clinton, who believes that reproductive rights are a \u201cfundamental human right\u201d, would, through repeal of the Hyde Amendment, force all taxpayers to fund all abortions, even partial birth, that is, \u201cday of birth\u201d abortions regardless of our religious convictions. Clinton is also willing to impose federal penalties, including denying tax-exempt status, in order to, as Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito wrote, \u201cstamp out every vestige of dissent\u201d to a far-left agenda. There is a deliberate and comprehensive anti-Christian plan being promoted by Hillary Clinton and funded by George Soros because they believe that Christian principles are an impediment to the implementation of their progressive policies. In her now infamous \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d speech at a September 9th New York City Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) fundraiser, Clinton said, \u201cYou know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic - you name it.\u201d The phrasing was no accident. Those \u201cgrossly generalistic\u201d accusations are the basis of every leftist diatribe meant to demonize any individual or group that stands in opposition to their extremist policies. As reported by Ken Klukowski, senior counsel with First Liberty Institute, the largest law firm in the United States exclusively dedicated to protecting religious liberty, Hillary\u2019s words originate from a report issued by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights two days before Clinton\u2019s anti-Christian screed. Chairman Martin Castro, an ally and supporter of Clinton and Obama, said in a statement accompanying the report, \u201cThe phrases \u2018religious liberty\u2019 and \u2018religious freedom\u2019 \u2026 remain code words for discrimination, intolerance, racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia, Christian supremacy or any form of intolerance.\u201d It is also no coincidence, according to conservative Ken Blackwell writing for The Hill, that Hillary\u2019s running mate, Tim Kaine, during his \"mission\" trip to Latin America in 1980, apparently was and may still be a zealous advocate of \u201cliberation theology,\u201d which is \u201ca radical, Marxist-based ideology at odds with the Church, the pope, and the United States, but supportive of (and supported by) the Soviet Union.\u201d All of that circles back to newly-released Wikileaks emails, in which longtime Clinton confidante, John Podesta discusses infiltrating the Catholic Church with progressive ideology to foment revolution as a \u201cCatholic Spring.\u201d Podesta said, \u201cWe created Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good to organize for a moment like this.\u201d Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good (CACG) is a George Soros-funded nonprofit organization dedicated to galvanizing Catholic and Christian voters to support progressive candidates, causes, and legislation. CACG, which deplores economic inequality, characterizes modern America as a society where \u201cgreed, materialism, and excessive individualism\u201d are ubiquitous and views conservative politics and free markets as the enemies of authentic social justice. That is why theology that adheres to millennia-old Christian teachings on human life, other social issues, and religious liberty are considered \u201cdeplorable\u201d and \u201cirredeemable\u201d by the Left. That is why, according to Hillary Clinton, traditional Christian views \u201chave to be changed.\u201d That is why John Podesta and George Soros established Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good; to make Christianity more amenable to Marxist-based ideologies such as government-run socialized healthcare, government redistribution of wealth and unlimited and unrestrained taxpayer-funded abortions. It is what the Hillary Clinton campaign, in their leaked emails, calls \u201cChristian democracy.\u201d It is what I call political genocide.

{"text":"Explosive undercover video reveals Clinton camp mischief: Remember the \u201cviolent protests\u201d that shut down a planned Trump rally in Chicago in March? Or the anti-Trump protests that closed a road to a Trump event in Arizona? There was nothing spontaneous about them. They were just following \u201ca script of engagement\u201d written by paid Clinton campaign operatives, according to an explosive new undercover video from James O\u2019Keefe and his investigative team at Project Veritas. I thought I was beyond being shocked by this campaign. But the Project Veritas expos\u00e9 of a well-orchestrated strategy to smear Donald Trump using paid thugs and Soviet-style provocations, is just beyond belief. Key to the strategy is a political \u201cblack operations\u201d specialist named Scott Foval, the National Field Director for a left-wing activist group called Americans United for Change. In undercover video shot by Project Veritas, Foval boasts of having local operatives ready to execute campaign dirty tricks all over the country. \u201cThe [Clinton] campaign pays the DNC, DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays the Foval Group, The Foval Group goes and executes the s**t,\u201d Foval tells the undercover reporter. One tactic Foval used with success was \u201cbird dogging,\u201d planting activists at Trump rallies to provoke violence. The goal was to show that Trump supporters were extremists, prone to violence, a theme Mrs. Clinton herself has sounded repeatedly. The more extreme tactic was to organize protests, as Foval boasted of having done in Chicago, to prevent Trump from even holding a planned rally. Is it unprecedented in U.S. political history? Probably not. But it sure makes the Watergate break-in and the deletion of 18 minutes of White House tapes by Richard Nixon look like amateur hour. \"It doesn\u2019t matter what the friggin\u2019 legal and ethics people say, we need to win this motherf--ker,\u201d Foval says. \u201cWe\u2019re starting anarchy here.\u201d Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich called it \u201ca direct assault on democracy and the rule of law\u201d in an interview with Sean Hannity on Monday night. If we still had a national media whose mission was to inform the public, this story should be dominating the news cycle. Foval goes on to describe in detail how he coordinated his anti-Trump storm-trooper actions with the Clinton campaign and a broad array of left-wing groups, including the Alliance for Change, Alliance for Retired Americans, the DNC, and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Super-PAC, Priorities USA. \u201cThe campaigns and DNC cannot coordinate with Priorities, but I guaran-damn-tee you that the people who run the Super PACs all talk to each other, and we and a few other people are the hubs of that communication.\u201d Congressional committees should be calling on the FBI to investigate what appears to prima facie evidence criminal collusion between the Clinton campaign, the Clinton Super PAC, and the political dirty tricks operations run by Foval and chief strategist, Robert Creamer. Creamer is the husband of Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill) and founded Democracy Partners in 2011, a group that brings together different left-wing organizations and coordinates their actions to meet Clinton campaign goals. \u201cWherever Trump and Pence are gonna be we have events,\u201d Creamer explains to the undercover reporter. \u201cWe have a call with the [Clinton] campaign every day to go over the focuses that need to be undertaken.\u201d Already, the DNC appears to have gone into panic mode. Foval has been fired by Americans United for Change, the activist group. This is the type of undercover investigation that Mike Wallace at 60 Minutes once did. The fact that an unaffiliated, non-profit group now must raise funds to pursue this type of investigation shows how corrupt our corporate media have become. Timmerman is a Donald Trump supporter.

{"text":"Trump says 'only one thing will work' to solve the North Korea crisis: If North Korea launched a nuclear attack, the death toll would be costly: perhaps as bad as 2.1 million deaths in Tokyo and Seoul alone. Media: TMTime Thomson Reuters US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that \"only one thing will work\" to solve the North Korea crisis, although he did not explicitly specify what that would be. \"Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years, agreements made and massive amounts of money paid......\" the president tweeted. \"...hasn't worked, agreements violated before the ink was dry, makings fools of U.S. negotiators. Sorry, but only one thing will work!\" he continued in a second tweet. It's unclear whether Trump was referring to the nuclear option when he said \"only one thing will work.\" A senior administration official told Business Insider that the White House had \"nothing else to add\" to the president's tweets, and the State Department did not return a request for comment. North Korea rapidly escalated its nuclear posturing over the summer. The rogue nation fired a missile over Japan a few weeks ago for the second time in two months. Last weekend, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters during a visit to China that the US conflict with North Korea is \"overheated\" and that the first priority was to calm things down. He said that the US has a direct line of communication open with Pyongyang over North Korea's nuclear tests, adding: \"We're not in a dark situation, a blackout.\" Trump diverged from the US State Department later that weekend and said Tillerson was \"wasting his time\" opening up talks with the North Korean regime. The president added that being nice to Kim \"hasn't worked in 25 years, why would it work now? Clinton failed, Bush failed, and Obama failed. I won't fail.\" Trump ramped up his rhetoric against the regime when the United Nations General Assembly convened on September 23, saying that \"rocket man\" Kim Jong Un was on a \"suicide mission,\" and that if he did not back down, the US would \"have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.\" Kim responded by saying he would \"surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire.\" North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, also said that Trump's comments made the possibility of a missile attack on the US mainland \"all the more inevitable.\" Ri also said that Trump had \"declared a war\" on North Korea through tweets he posted after the UN meeting and that the country could shoot down US strategic bombers even if they were not in its airspace, according to Reuters. Speaking to reporters in New York in September, Ri pointed to one of Trump's tweets that said Ri and Kim Jong Un \" won't be around much longer\" if the rogue nation continued its nuclear provocations as constituting a declaration of war. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, rejected North Korea's claim later that day.\"We've not declared war on North Korea,\" Sanders told reporters during the White House daily briefing. \"Frankly, the suggestion of that is absurd.\"","label":0}
{"text":"#RiggedSystem: Debate proves media part of banana republic vote: \u00a9 Getty Images Elections are about power: who has it, who doesn\u2019t. Until this year, we were told that the candidate with the most money would win. Why? Because money buys negative ads to influence an uninformed electorate. Who keeps the electorate uninformed? The national media. When I started to work as a reporter in the early 1980s, I thought my job was to inform my readers. Somehow over the past twenty years, the job description has changed. Now it\u2019s all about \u201cthe narrative.\u201d \u201cThe narrative\u201d is the daily spin the national media decides to put on the news. It determines what they will cover, how they will cover it \u2014 and what topics they will exile to Tinfoilia, that distant fringe world where Yahoo is not a search engine and America actually stands for something worth fighting and dying for. Last night, the phony journalists were all waiting. You could see and hear them on Twitter and on the blogs. When will Trump say it? And they were disappointed. At least early on. For the first twenty-five minutes, Trump and Hillary stayed on topic, and fought each other on policy grounds over their picks for the Supreme Court, and the life or death decisions those justices will make for generations of future Americans. They sparred on taxes. Hillary promised flat-out she will \u201ctax the rich,\u201d which in Hillary-speak means anyone earning more than minimum wage. Trump said he will lower individual tax rates, lower corporate taxes, and grow the economy. The media heads were drooping. Boring! Because they don\u2019t want this election to be about policy, where the tired left-wing dogmas Hillary is spouting have been tried and failed repeatedly for generations. They were just waiting for Trump to say it. They would know what \u201cit\u201d is when they heard it. Hillary looked down repeatedly. A script? She seemed to have attack lines her staff had prepared. When Trump wouldn\u2019t take the bait, she tried another. The media held its breath. Will he bite this time? Will he go off the rails? Because that is the narrative. It\u2019s all about Trump\u2019s character, his \u201cunfitness\u201d for office. That is the narrative Hillary and her campaign gurus in the media have decided to push, because they don\u2019t have anything better. Finally, Chris Wallace \u2014 who ought to be shot for keeping the candidates on substantive topics \u2014 asks Trump if he will accept the result of the election. And Trump won\u2019t say the words. Now the phony journalists wake up. There it is, like the response in catechism class (okay, none of them has gone to catechism class). And he won\u2019t say it. He won\u2019t say that he will accept the results of a phony, rigged election. Suddenly, they have their \u201cgotcha\u201d moment. Never-Trumper Ben Shapiro was tweeting, and he caught it immediately: At exactly 10:17 PM eastern time \u2013 fifteen minutes before the end of the debate \u2013 CBS News, Reuters, USA Today, CNN and the BBC issued their writ for tomorrow\u2019s headlines: \u201cWhen asked if he will accept the results of the election, Donald Trump says \u2018I will look at it at the time.\u2019\u201d And then something horrifying happened. No, it wasn\u2019t Hillary\u2019s phony horror that somehow Donald Trump would set off a remake of Bush v. Gore in an evenly divided Supreme Court come November. Nor was it visions of street fighting and riots. Donald Trump started calling them out. He told the truth about our rigged elections. \u201cFirst of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so dishonest. And they\u2019ve poisoned the mind of the voters.\u201d And then he used the live cameras, and in front of tens of millions of Americans, he delivered the news \u2014 the real news that the media has refused to cover during the campaign. He told America about our rotten election system, the millions of dead voters who have been put back on the voter rolls. Why? So the Democrats can get the tombstone vote. He told Americans about the \u201cmillions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn\u2019t be registered to vote.\u201d Oh yes, Virginia. That means you. Voter fraud cases are finally being investigated in dozens of states, and the phony media continues to pretend, \u201cthere is no such thing as voter fraud.\u201d Trump even mentioned the James O\u2019Keefe Project Veritas videos that captured on camera Democrat party operatives boasting about their dirty tricks campaigns, including massive coordinated voter fraud schemes. Donald Trump wants this election to be about truth. The media would like it to be about illusions. (Even Alan Schulkin, the Democrat commissioner of the New York City Board of Elections, has admitted that Democrat operatives \u201cbus people around to vote\u201d and supports a photo ID requirement to prevent rampant voter fraud). The ease with which ineligible voters can cast ballots in America, robbing legitimate voters of their voice, make elections in many Third World countries look good. And that\u2019s a disgrace. Here\u2019s the real headline the phony journalists don\u2019t want you to read: Americans are waking up the horror show. And the media is aghast. Because if Donald Trump wins in November, they will stand along with Hillary and Emperor Obama, exposed, cold and naked before the truth. And that is truly horrifying to them.

{"text":"Duty-bound: Donor explains why Trump deserves support over Clinton: This has been a particularly vicious election season, with Hillary Clinton slinging mud at Donald Trump in an immoral attempt to distract the American public from her many failures. Hillary says Mr. Trump is destroying our country and a racist anti-Semite. On the contrary, Mr. Trump is making our country stronger by continuing to stand for the values and ideals that we have always held sacrosanct. Well, I can tell you as a Jewish Republican that this is simply not true. Those attacking Mr. Trump \u2014 like Hillary \u2014 just don\u2019t have the same values as myself and Mr. Trump: values such as free speech, protecting our country from disruptive forces and allying strongly with Israel \u2014 the sole democracy in the Middle East. But Hillary clearly looks down on democracy; if elected, she would ensure we never have a fair election in this country again. Just like her husband, Hillary has a deplorable track record. If Hillary were to become president, you could say goodbye to free speech. She harangues Mr. Trump for speaking his mind and for being genuine. But that is why we need him. We need someone to lead our country who is unafraid to speak his mind, calling out the faux leadership we\u2019ve seen in the past eight years. Hillary has shown that she stands against the Bill of Rights, a document representing everything our country stands for. Hillary says she\u2019s for free speech, but this is a clear lie. She does everything in her power to quiet those who disagree with her. She calls Mr. Trump a racist despite the fact that she supports the racist Black Lives Matter movement. She is a disciple of Marxist Saul Alinsky and anti-American George Soros, two men committed to destroying our country to turn it into a Communist Utopia. Incapable of maintaining free speech, she somehow also fails in one of the few arenas in which free speech is not protected. Her wanton abuse of government protocol proves that she is not qualified for the security clearances that come with being secretary of state \u2014 let alone president. Hillary has stood behind the United Nations \u2014 an entity known to be anti-United States and anti-Israel \u2014 as it has espoused dangerous rhetoric. She supported the Organization of the Islamic Conference\u2019s resolution to weed out discrimination and hate speech against Muslims, yet has done nothing to combat the growing anti-Semitism in our country and the world. Mr. Trump is the only person willing to call things what they are and to stand up to \u201cpolitically correct\u201d bullies like the U.N., who are slowly dismantling the United States and Israel. Hillary refuses to show any political friendship to Israel, refusing to accept Israel\u2019s right to control Jerusalem during her tenure in the State Department. Mr. Trump is the first major candidate to offer real immigration reform. He is the only candidate who will protect Christians from the worldwide persecution they face and root out the anti-Semitism that has been choking the globe. Mr. Trump will restore credibility to U.S. foreign policy as a strong commander-in-chief. Hillary can\u2019t do this. She has already shown that she is beholding to political Islam entities. Not only does she want to open our borders to everyone, but she wants our country to mirror the Islamist countries she so ardently supports. Hillary supported a deal that provided $150 billion to Iran \u2014 a material support of terrorism. This isn\u2019t just immoral \u2014 it\u2019s illegal. Her support of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Libya and Syria supports the war on women. Hillary says Mr. Trump disrespects women; her political allies abuse, torture, jail and oppress women. Her ties to the Muslim Brotherhood in Libya resulted in the deaths of four Americans. Due to her refusal to reinforce protection or send in military forces to protect the U.S. ambassador to Libya and consulate employees, Hillary is directly responsible for these deaths. Does she believe in the Islamist regime of terror? She believes in her bank account. She has sold favors to our enemies in exchange for Clinton Foundation funding. In return, she allows them carte blanche to invade other countries and continue to fund terrorism worldwide. And her vice presidential pick is no better, showing that when she succumbs to her health issues, he will maintain her status quo of criminality. The future of Western Civilization is at grave risk if a non-believer like Hillary wins. It is our duty as, not just Jews and Republicans, but as Americans to ensure Mr. Trump is elected to keep our country and way of life safe.

No matter what the election outcome next week, the media will be big losers. This campaign season has seen much of the media rip off their veneer of objectivity, too often acting instead as an unofficial campaign arm working to elect Hillary Clinton. The latest revelation \u2014 that the town hall moderator overseeing a Democratic primary debate gave CNN contributor Donna Brazile a peek at expected questions, and Brazile then fed Hillary Clinton's campaign staff a question expected to come up in the primary debate against Bernie Sanders \u2014 confirms the too cozy relationships between the politicians and the so-called journalists and officials who are supposed to be helping Americans get unbiased information about candidates. Bernie Sanders supporters should be outraged: We've seen time and again how the DNC was never going to allow their guy a fair shot at the nomination. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz had to resign from her post at the DNC after emails revealed she was favoring Clinton and working against Sanders. Now we know that, at the same time, Brazile at CNN was proving her Clinton loyalist bona fides by abusing the system and rigging the game to bolster Clinton over Sanders. The DNC must have been laughing themselves silly over the fast one they were pulling to elevate Brazile, who was putatively objective when it came to Democratic primary contenders, to dispose of Wasserman-Schultz\u2019s double dealing. Instead we now learn what insiders already knew: that Brazile was a corrupt Clinton partisan herself. Meanwhile, Wasserman-Schultz went to \u2026 Clinton campaign staff. BREAKING: DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz announces resignation, effective at end of this week's DNC Convention pic.twitter.com\/8CGijaHCyt \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) July 24, 2016 Oh the small incestuous little world of Washington. Americans now have reason to wonder about the other debates and who else in the so-called unbiased media world was seeking to assist the Clinton campaign by sneaking her a preview of questions or tilting the news in her favor. Such thinking is no longer cynical; it's just realistic as we've seen just how widespread the corruption and bias goes. And if people are willing to cheat in the debates, what else wouldn\u2019t they justify cheating on to accomplish their ends? MORE STORIES FROM THE HILL: It is precisely the repeated revelations of cheating at debates, inciting violence at rallies, and collusion between the DNC and their dirty tricksters, that lead many Americans to believe \u2014 not unreasonably \u2014 that, given just a whiff of deniability, these same people would unhesitatingly attempt to rig the election. Count on Hillary Clinton to respond as she always does: Deny any knowledge of the wrong doing, (because you see, you can\u2019t actually prove that she actually saw fill-in-the-blank), blame someone else, (the Russians have become the Democrat\u2019s iteration of \u201cthe dog ate my homework\u201d), and distract the American people with the idea that there is a vast conspiracy out to get her (projection, anyone?) When first caught, Brazile followed the same playbook, deflecting from the veracity of the emails and distracting with claims of persecution. She wanted voters to think it's nothing but a dirty political trick to expose the ugly truth of such back-dealing, but in a different era this was called whistle-blowing and celebrated. There is a whole cohort of politically powerful or connected people in Clinton\u2019s orbit who apparently think rules and boundaries are for other people, not for them. Wikileaks, among others, is hoisting them on their own petard. The American people have quite had it with this privileged, hypocritical crew.

{"text":"Pardon me: The Hillary scandals are just getting started: \u00a9 Getty Images If you think you have scandal fatigue now, just wait. Should Hillary Clinton win the presidency on Nov. 8, you can expect an endless stream of Hillary scandals, even if President Obama issues a pre-emptive pardon for her before the election. Yes, the president has the power to issue pardons before an offender has been charged with a crime. That precedent was established when the Supreme Court ruled in 1866 that a presidential pardon \"extends to every offence known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken, or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment.\" Discussion of the Supreme Court ruling in Ex parte Garland sprouted up on Democrat-leaning websites and blogs at the end of the Bush 43 presidency, when the liberal establishment convinced itself that only by pardoning intelligence officials involved in extraordinary renditions and the enhanced interrogation of terrorists could they escape jail sentences. Of course, President George W. Bush didn\u2019t need to pardon torturers, because U.S. intelligence officials had not committed torture. Rather, they had acted within a set of strict constitutional guidelines set out by then Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo (derisively referred to by Wikipedia as the \u201cTorture Memos\u201d). But while a presidential pardon might avoid the sorry spectacle of a national security investigation by the FBI of an incoming president for her reckless mishandling of classified information while secretary of State, it would in no way deter Republicans in Congress from conducting their own investigations of Mrs. Clinton, up to and including impeachment proceedings. For example, we now know that four separate FBI field offices have been conducting a corruption investigation of the Clinton Foundation for well over a year. Imagine for a moment how Congress would react if Obama were to pardon Mrs. Clinton not just for her email woes but for her past corruption, even for corruption not yet discovered? Do you really think Republicans, even if they were in the minority, would let that one go? I recall the tenacity of Rep. Henry Gonz\u00e1lez, a long-time Democrat back-bencher from Texas who rose to become chairman of the House Banking Committee in 1989. Gonz\u00e1lez used all the wiles of his congressional office to prosecute President George H.W. Bush for arming Saddam Hussein in the lead-up to the first Gulf War. Gonz\u00e1lez was so successful in his efforts that they contributed to Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 victory over an incumbent president who, at his peak, had a 90 percent approval rating. Here are just a few of the Hillary scandals Congress could pursue: \u2022 The Loretta Lynch meeting with Bill Clinton on the tarmac of the Phoenix airport, just as the FBI was getting ready to make public its conclusions on the Hillary Clinton private email server. Did Bill Clinton promise Lynch that Hillary, if elected president, would reappoint her as Attorney General? \u2022 Pay for play at the Clinton Foundation. I can imagine several committee chairmen exploring whether the actions of the Clinton Foundation violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). While a presidential pardon might clear Mrs. Clinton of RICO charges, it wouldn\u2019t cover Bill Clinton, Chelsea Clinton, Doug Band, Huma Abedin, or a host of other Clinton Foundation officials who solicited donations from foreign corporations and foreign governments in exchange for official favors while Mrs. Clinton was Secretary of State. Will they all go to the mat (or jail) to protect Mrs. Clinton and her scandal-plagued presidency? Pay-to-play schemes that violated RICO could lead to multiple federal prosecutions to disgorge illicit profits through civil forfeiture proceedings. Imagine the Clinton Foundation having to repay the Governments of Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Algeria and Qatar tens of millions of dollars for having essentially traded payoffs for U.S. government favors or for the promise of favors to come? What about the Varkey Foundation and its GEMS education initiative, which paid Bill Clinton more than $56 million to serve as front man for a gigantic fund-raising scheme? \u201cUpon funding and implementation, these commitments will have a total value of over $70 billion,\u201d the foundation website boasts. Are they waiting for Mrs. Clinton to be sworn into office before those \u201ccommitments\u201d can be banked? Are donors expecting future favors from a Clinton administration in return for their money? I can\u2019t imagine Congress not wanting to know answers to those questions. Or what about contributions to the Clinton Global Initiative from the Abraaj Group, a UAE private equity company partly-owned by the family of Jaafar Dhia Jaafar, the mastermind of Saddam Hussein\u2019s nuclear weapons program? Congressional investigators will want to know if those donations influenced a decision made by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to award the Abraaj Group hundreds of millions of dollars in investment management contracts through the State Department\u2019s Overseas Private Investment Corporation. \u2022 Illegal coordination between Hillary\u2019s presidential campaign, her super Pac, and the Democratic National Committee. Allegations of illegal collusion stemmed from undercover video shot by Project Veritas that captured DNC self-styled \u201cundercover\u201d operatives boasting of carrying out dirty tricks in coordination with the Clinton presidential campaign. Congress will want to hear testimony from the DNC operatives, and will undoubtedly demand that the DNC provide financial records detailing their relationship to these \u201cconsultants.\u201d \u2022 The Iran nuclear deal. Congress will surely want to investigate Mrs. Clinton\u2019s role in establishing a secret back-channel with Iran that led to the worst diplomatic deal in U.S. history, a deal that rewarded a terrorist and terror-sponsor regime with $150 billion and a sure path to nuclear weapons. Did Mrs. Clinton meet with Iranian officials or regime intermediaries before official talks began? Did she make promises to Clinton Foundation donors that she would \u201copen up\u201d Iran for U.S. business once she became president? Oh, the scandals will be rich, and they will be unending. And they are all of the Clintons\u2019 making. They will not only further weaken our hand in foreign relations, but will distract us from what needs to be done domestically to make this country great again. Is that what you want, America?

{"text":"Barack Obama\u2019s spy games ignored by yawning media:  ANALYSIS\/OPINION: Barack Obama, the president who rode a wave of promises for uber-transparency into eight years at the White House, has apparently been \u2014 well, not. Lucy, I think you got some \u2018splainin\u2019 to do. Frankly put, the guy\u2019s just been dinged by courts for letting his intel agencies conduct tons of illegal surveillance. What\u2019s more: the same source that chided Obama has given high kudos to President Donald Trump for upholding American citizens\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights. Specifically, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence just declassified a ruling from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review \u2014 the FISA court that hears appeals about cases involving secret government monitoring of those on U.S. soil. And what that declassified document showed was that the Fourth Amendment rights of numerous American citizens were violated during the last year of Obama\u2019s administration. And even more specifically: the violations dealt with Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the part that mandates feds who are spying for justifiable reasons to take extra care to safeguard information on citizen information that\u2019s inadvertently collected. These protections are aimed at upholding the Fourth Amendment rights of Americans, the ones that guarantee citizens will be secure in their persons and possessions and kept free of unreasonable and warrantless searches. Apparently, Obama\u2019s intel didn\u2019t follow proper procedure. Judge Rosemary Collyer, writing the opinion for the FISC, called the cavalier treatment with which Team Obama handled Section 702 data a \u201cvery serious Fourth Amendment issue.\u201d Collyer also dinged Obama\u2019s National Security Agency for an \u201cinstitutional lack of candor,\u201d and the FBI for passing along \u201craw FISA information\u201d to even those agents and officials who didn\u2019t need access. Trump\u2019s put a stop to such cavalier handling of intel \u2014 at least, according to the court. Once again, it\u2019s a case of Democrats talking the talk \u2014 paying lip service to something as crucial as the Fourth Amendment \u2014 but failing to walk the walk. And the media? Well, all media eyes are turned toward Russia right now, looking for the latest bit of innuendo that might be spun as proof positive of a President Trump collusion with Vladimir Putin. No time left to look at the egregious constitutional offenses of the prior administration.","label":1}

He is specifically talking about NBC News\u2019 report on a meeting this past summer where it is reported that President Trump asked the military for a tenfold increase to our nuclear weapons arsenal.  With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2017  This is far from the first time the president has taken issue with the media. He frequently calls reports that paint him in a negative light \u201cfake news.\u201d But with his tweet this morning, he has upped the ante with his war with the media. The accuracy of the story is not what this debate is about. It is about whether President Trump should be able to pull NBC News\u2019 license. Those who think he should be able to pull NBC News\u2019 license point to the fact that many news outlets have often distorted what the president has said or done. They see these news outlets, like NBC News, as supporting a political agenda against the president and that their false reporting is hurting the country. They feel that the president is an honest man and these media reports are made to make him appear dishonest. They point out that the reports are filled with anonymous sources and so, they can\u2019t be true, but made up to discredit the president. To the people who do not think he should be able to pull their license, this is a First Amendment issue. Freedom of the press and free speech can\u2019t be suppressed by the government. If the president were allowed to do that, then we would be well on our way to living in a fascist country. The president shutting down media outlets he does not like is how we end up with government-controlled media. With the president\u2019s tweet this morning, he again brings attention back to his war with the media. He has been using the term \u201cfake news\u201d for some time now. Many of the president\u2019s supporters see the media as pushing a far left agenda and bent on destroying the president.

Has NBC News been pushing a false, left-wing agenda bent on destroying the president? Or, is the president dangerously close to attempting to destroy the First Amendment?

{"text":"Stephen Paddock Had Explosives, Bomb-Making Materials; Attn, Gun Control Idiots:   Las Vegas mass murderer Stephen Paddock had a lot of explosive material and the ability to build bombs, which he was apparently planning to do. This is important evidence that gun control doesn\u2019t work and wouldn\u2019t have with him because, as many of my Twitter followers pointed out, those who are faced with strict gun control usually resort to bombs and running people over with vehicles. It\u2019s also more proof that Paddock took his cue from Islamic terrorists. Yesterday\u2019s Wall Street Journal reported:  Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said they also found Tannerite, an explosive that detonates when shot by bullets. . . .  That was in Paddock\u2019s Mandalay Bay hotel room. But there\u2019s more:  In Paddock\u2019s car, authorities found more ammunition and ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can be used to make explosives, Mr. Lombardo said.  Ammonium nitrate is easily obtained. You can buy it on the net from purveyors like Alibaba. These kinds of explosive materials are hallmarks of Al-Qaeda, ISIS, and other Islamic terrorist groups who provide shopping lists and how-to videos on how to build bomb devices. They are not the hallmarks of someone who is \u201cjust crazy.\u201d Or someone who has heavy gambling debts (and we\u2019ve yet to see any evidence that Paddock had any gambling debts, just info that he was a high-stakes gambler, which is not the same as losing and owing). So, what was Paddock planning to bomb? Or was he keeping that stuff in his car in case his plan with hotel windows and the automatic guns didn\u2019t work? That appears likely. If he was refused entry into the hotel or not allowed to take his guns and ammo in\u2013had they been detected (which they weren\u2019t), he could\u2019ve set off bombs in the venue. And, again, this is a memo to the two Jidiot Jimmys\u2013Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon\u2013and all of the other gun-grabbing, statist, gun control freaks: when guns are taken away from criminals and terrorists, they a) go to the black market where they easily obtain them; or b) turn to other methods of mass murder that can arguably be more dangerous and more effective, including bombs and other explosive devices to blow people up and vehicles to mow people down. How much you wanna bet Stephen Paddock got instructions from Muslims on how to build a bomb using ammonium nitrate? Don\u2019t bet against it.","label":1}

{"text":"Will Anything Happen November 4th?: Antifa is calling for a peaceful protest every day starting November 4th, but others are saying online that Antifa is calling for an all-out violent war in the streets. Still others are saying plainly that Antifa is planning to instigate a civil war in order to remove Trump from the White House. Dailycaller.com reports: Antifa websites like Going Down, Sub.Media, and Insurrection News have been promoting the group, which calls itself the Revolutionary Abolitionist Movement (RAM). The press release the group published is filled with far-fetched claims about how \u201cmosques are being ruthlessly bombed\u201d and how \u201cLGBTQ are being battered.\u201d RAM cites, with pride, cop killers like Mumia Abu Jamal who shot and killed a police officer in Philadelphia in 1981 and Russell Shoats who shot a police officer in the back five times in 1970. RAM is calling for the abolition of gender and the expropriation of private property to begin the revolutionary process. Far Left Watch notes that RAM has been hosting anti-police workshops, a class on anarchism, and a class called \u2018Our Enemies in Blue\u2019. Antifa and Refuse Fascism are front groups for the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP). The RCP has and is calling for the overt overthrow of the government of the United States. Many of these groups are being funded by George Soros. Anti-fascist groups in the United States have their genesis in communist groups across Europe. Just about everyone who was not a follower of communism was identified as \u2018fascist\u2019. As today, a non-communist is now considered a fascist. Despite calls for violence and violent clashes with Trump supporters. The main stream media has been very lenient with Antifa, calling them crusaders against white supremacy and racism. They naively or purposely have enabled and promoted violent communists by taking Antifa at face value while concealing their real agenda. California Governor Jerry Brown recently said about President Trump, \u201cI hope the rest of the world does their part in providing a powerful opposition.\u201d It is this kind of inciteful rhetoric that encourages these groups to violence.

Rand Paul has returned to work on Capitol Hill after a Trump-hating, Bernie Sanders-supporting, left-wing Democrat put him in the hospital after what looks like a politically motivated attack. The junior Republican senator from Kentucky returned to Washington Monday in time for the Senate Finance Committee to begin considering the Senate tax reform bill, which is now said to include a provision repealing Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate, as Paul has long proposed. The afternoon of Friday, Nov. 3, Rene Albert Boucher, 59, ambushed 54-year-old Paul, his next-door neighbor of 17 years, at his home, crushing Paul\u2019s ribs while the senator was performing yard work. A registered Democrat, Boucher has practiced as an anesthesiologist in Bowling Green. Paul is an ophthalmologist. Boucher has entered a not guilty plea to a misdemeanor fourth-degree assault charge. \u201cFrom my perspective, I\u2019m not really too concerned about what someone\u2019s motive is,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI\u2019m just concerned that I was attacked from the back and somebody broke six of my ribs and gave me a damaged lung where at least for now I have trouble speaking and breathing and now I\u2019ve hurt for 10 days.\u201d There was \u201cno justification\u201d for the attack, Paul told the Washington Examiner this week. Senior Paul adviser Doug Stafford said separately that Paul and Boucher hadn\u2019t spoken for years before the incident. \u201cThis was not a \u2018fight,\u2019 it was a blindside, violent attack by a disturbed person,\u201d Stafford said in a statement. \u201cAnyone claiming otherwise is simply uninformed or seeking media attention.\u201d This is Paul\u2019s second reported brush with political violence this year.

{"text":"Spitting on veterans, taking the knee: insert picture In the 1960s, overtly communist agitators came up with an effective strategy for dividing Americans: they attacked veterans returning from the Vietnam War. They mercilessly targeted men who had the least power in society: those who lacked the resources to avoid the draft through political connections or college enrollment. Following Saul Alinsky\u2019s hateful playbook, they targeted, isolated, and demonized young men coming home who had just been through the hell of war. The strategy paid off in great whopping dividends of social division and discord. It also did nothing to convince ordinary Americans or elected officials of the need to stop the war: instead, it weakened the rest of the anti-war movement. But here is the important part, the part nobody remembers now: ending the war didn\u2019t matter to the communist agitators who screamed at legless 21-year olds returning from Saigon. It didn\u2019t matter because those agitators were not anti-war: they were pro-communist warmongers rooting for communist victory abroad and at home. This important history is now willfully denied. Mere mocking is enough to shut down discussion of it in the worlds of education, the media, and politics. Even conservative pundits and politicians dumbly grandstand against \u201cMcCarthyism,\u201d as if there never was a real and powerful communist movement in America, let alone one now. Mocking the idea that communist agitation in America was and is real has become even more fashionable of late, just as communist Antifa thugs and their useful idiots in academia riot on the streets and shut down free speech on college campuses \u2013 and Google campuses, and everywhere else suppression of thought is deemed a special priority of the human resources battalion. (Editor\u2019s note: America Under Siege: Antifa, is now available for viewing online. The documentary film headlined by renowned radicalism expert Trevor Loudon, is a production of Dangerous Documentaries, which, like Bombthrowers, is a project of Capital Research Center.) Such mass denial feels like a psychological phenomenon, but underlying it now (unlike in the Sixties) is a completely rational fear: fear of losing one\u2019s job for saying the wrong thing, or losing one\u2019s grade point average because the hag teaching you Revolutionary College Composition has sniffed out your carefully concealed resistance to her ideology, thereby jeopardizing your chance at having a career or supporting a family or all the other things that make a nation survive. This strategy of the communist thugs has never wavered because it works: divide ordinary, non-political Americans against each other by \u201coccupying\u201d a beloved institution or public property with confrontational (but disguised) communist tactics. Make sure nobody can escape your politics, not in pre-school or college or at work, or when they\u2019re in their own homes settling in to watch TV. Count on the New York Times or the New York Times and Hollywood to carry your water (or Gatorade). Hold people hostage until they give in and give you things, in the entirely vain hope you will go away. We are witnessing this strategy being played out in the national football and basketball leagues, where useful idiots \u201ctake a knee,\u201d allegedly to protest non-existent \u201cracist police brutality,\u201d but actually to lash out at all police, and white people, and Americans. Like the soldiers coming home from Vietnam, it is the courageous men (and women) serving in uniform who are the overt targets of the agitator\u2019s bullets and rage, but all Americans of all races are trapped in the agitators\u2019 cultural crosshairs. \u201cTaking a knee\u201d is just the latest iteration of \u201cOccupy Wall Street\u201d or \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d or any of the other countless stupidity parades disrupting college campuses. Countless more useful idiots join in by virtue-signaling their support for professional agitators whose real goals have nothing to do with \u201cpeace\u201d or \u201cequality\u201d or \u201cbullying\u201d or understanding the historical pain of minorities or, as so many columnists are bleating now, \u201cfree speech.\u201d If we had honest academicians in the universities teaching the real history of domestic communist agitation, maybe we wouldn\u2019t be so universally gormless in the face of this now.

I find it fascinating that online liberal \u2018fact checking\u2019 sites adamantly insist that the quote is \u201cbogus\u201d. Further, they go on to say that gun rights activists often haul up that quote in order to drive home an argument for gun ownership - as though simply expressing that concept in such a context were evil. Gun ownership is entirely about self defense The argument for unfettered gun ownership comes naturally, supports itself, and is entirely righteous. Every year in this nation, medical malpractice takes more lives than do guns. It is estimated that between 800,000 to 2,000,000 deaths are prevented annually by guns - both in the hands of law enforcement as well as individual gun owners. Guns, in and of themselves, pose no threat to anyone but are regularly vilified by professional politicians who won\u2019t themselves give up their own guns or the guns of their hired protection. The Second Amendment of the Constitution guaranteeing every American citizen\u2019s right to arm himself with firepower was considered to be the second most important right by the framers - preceded only by our right to express the opinions we hold as sacred and defendable. It is not surprising that both those amendments are the most hated by the liberal left and its partnering spokespeople the liberal media. The Second Amendment was not adopted to ensure our ability to hunt for food. Nor did it have anything to do with sportsmanship or target practice. Gun ownership is entirely about self defense. And, in the case of the intent of the framers who had just escaped the tyranny of England\u2019s monarchy, the Second Amendment was absolutely provided for the people to be able to defend themselves against tyrannical and runaway government. And this is why the potentially tyrannical and runaway, professional political leaders of today jump at any chance to take guns away from law-abiding Americans. Only hours after the recent bloodbath in Las Vegas, liberal left politicians were instant to make gun control statements, before even offering any sympathy to the bereft surviving friends and family members of the victims of that crowd. The bodies of the dead from that massacre had not even been entirely identified and next of kin notified, before the liberal left politicians vaingloriously marched down the steps of our Capitol building in DC and declared yet another war against gun ownership. Almost without exception, the mass-murdering shooters of the late 20th and 21st century here in America have been leftist politically or left-leaning Islamist terrorists It is remarkably noteworthy that, almost without exception, the mass-murdering shooters of the late 20th and 21st century here in America have been leftist politically or left-leaning Islamist terrorists. The nut-jobs of cultic liberalism or progressive socialist ideology do all the murdering. And then their political leaders vilify and strain to penalize and put additional controls on the conservative and often Christian gun owners who do no violence to anyone. Indeed, the ancient bumper sticker that was so popular back in the late 60s early 70s - \u201cWHEN GUNS ARE OUTLAWED, ONLY OUTLAWS WILL HAVE GUNS\u201d - has never been anything less than 100% true. Whether the outlaw is coming through your backdoor as a burglar\/rapist\/murderer, or the outlaw is coming through your front door as a 21st century storm trooper in the employ of a government that has just declared itself to be your overseer and landlord, a gun can serve as the only voice of protest either might hear. And both of those culprits are absolutely aware of that. The liberal media and liberal left are currently up on their haunches, fighting tooth and nail to push back the unforgivable insubordination of the majority of Americans who are being reintroduced to the power afforded them through our Constitution. The framers, I don\u2019t believe, ever envisioned the extent of liberty that scrap of parchment would provide for the recovering remnant of righteousness in days as evil as these. And President Donald Trump is the target of unbelievable contempt from the left that thought the end of Constitutional America was finally in sight. Few seem to recall how our last chief executive, America\u2019s first and worst black president, had declared our Constitution to be an outdated drag that had served its purpose. And he once joked that the people who had written our Constitution obviously hadn\u2019t planned on cooperating with the changes he had in mind for our nation. All the while he and his wife were, in eight years of hate-filled speeches, bolting together a race-hate Frankenstein that is only now beginning to walk. They were words that oozed easily from that devil\u2019s brood of smooth-tongued snakes who knew they were talking to a fragmented and distracted audience. Continued below... In a free society, the only control gained from \u2018Gun Control\u2019 will be the terminal upperhand given to the elite few who want selfishly to control us all. Our sleepy preoccupation had allowed all sorts of scandal and treachery - from Benghazi, to \u2018e-mailgate\u2019, to the Iran nuke deal including pallets of cash shipped secretly to the turbaned friends of that regime. And the cancer of that administration, along with the monstrous enabling liberal media\/entertainment industry, thought they finally had a stranglehold on the America they were sure they controlled. Hillary started drinking her victory champagne way too early on that election eve flight to NYC. But that night it was only God\u2019s grace that gave us another four years to keep those wolves and cobras at bay. As I have said so many times before, if the liberal slime (who are now feverishly romancing the na\u221a\u00d8ve youth of our nation) ever again fully get their hooks and fangs into our governmental infrastructure, America as we have known it will be only a fond memory. But, in the meantime, it is obvious that the leftists are wanting no guns waiting for them when they finally undo the mistake they made in allowing a President Donald Trump to interrupt their takeover. Protecting ourselves is not a conservative fantasy. It is a God-given mandate. The gift of being able to - WITH THE PULL OF THE TRIGGER - stop bloodthirsty wickedness from ravaging the precious pearls of our faith, love and sweaty labor, can certainly be part of the assignment God gave us as stewards of the liberty we have in Christ. (Luke 22:36, Psalm 82:4, Psalm 144:1, Matt. 7:6, etc.) It is our vulnerable liberty that, like a shining light, allows us to care for our children and openly be the example that God has called us to be. The devil\u2019s battle to take away the bullet, the only ballot that our own corrupt government or an invading one cannot ignore, is truly the last ground in a fight the corrupt political forces in this nation know they must capture. And, as they have shown us to date, the likes of a George Soros, Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton - our adversaries who are making the world safe for themselves - don\u2019t play by the rules when the rules don\u2019t work in their favor. In a free society, the only control gained from \u2018Gun Control\u2019 will be the terminal upperhand given to the elite few who want selfishly to control us all. NOW is the unreturning time to rally in support of our President who wants to preserve our Constitution. And with our every opportunity and vote, let us work to preserve our right to defend ourselves. The Second Amendment is worthy of our defense. It is there to defend us. Don\u2019t ever lose sight of that. ","label":1}
{"text":"Shame on Cut-And-Run Conservatives\u2014Stand With Judge Roy: insert picture Rising accusations of sexual assault, abuse, and child molestation are (thankfully) bringing creepy Hollywood to its knees. We should rejoice, since these stories have been documented and released to the public at great length. But do we automatically stand by our men or our team when someone issues allegations against people whom we have trusted or look up to? Ben Shapiro has warned conservatives about partisan responses to allegations of sexual abuse. I agree. Judge Roy Moore has been rocked, targeted with serious allegations of sexual abuse, including with minors. Are these accusations true? Will they sink his campaign? Sexual misconduct is wrong, whether the criminal is a Democrat or a Republican, and anyone who commits such terrible acts should not be in public office. When former Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert was exposed as a child molester who was bribing his victims with hush money, I joined with Republicans around the country denouncing him. But we need to investigate accusations, not rush to conclusions. Leviticus outlines the proper stance on moral contagion. No priest pronounced anyone \u201cunclean\u201d with leprosy after the first allegation, but at least three checks took place before a formal declaration. Take accusations seriously, but investigate them whether they are true or not. No one should arbitrarily appease every charge of sexual abuse. Liberal Democrat Alan Dershowitz was accused of sexual misconduct last year. He denied it flatly, settled a defamation lawsuit in his favor, and the world moved on. With clear standards on these matters established, let\u2019s also acknowledge that the corrupt media has a deliberate penchant for going after Republicans over even the hint of impropriety. The mainstream media equated Todd Akin and his \u201clegitimate rape\u201d comment with Anthony Weiner\u2019s sexting. Akin is not in jail, while Weiner just reported to prison for sexting a minor. By the way, it had taken three weeks of repeated pressure from Andrew Breitbart before former Congressman Weiner admitted to his social media perversion. Contrast that media slow-walk with a New York Republican when he was caught sexting. He was immediately chastised by the press and forced to step down. There is a double-standard in the media when it comes to these allegations. The press will \u201creport first, question later\u201d with Republicans. With Democrats, they question repeatedly and try to stave off any coverage when the Democrat is indeed guilty. The liberal media is a Republican Reputation Shredding machine, searching and destroying conservatives any way possible. Sadly, Republicans are still cutting and running, this time because of a WaPo hit piece. Despite the liberal media bias, let\u2019s look at these allegations. The first major accuser is Leigh Corfman, who claimed that Moore made sexual advances on her when she was 14. The Washington Post tried to round Moore out as some kind of teenage predator, but three of the four women in the article were of legal age, even if their stories were true. Corfman\u2019s story has begun to fall apart under closer examination. Another exclusive shows some journalistic malpractice, as reporters urged Corfman to \u201ccome forward\u201d. Then we find that these accusers are hard-core Democratic operatives, one of whom offered sign language services for the Hilary Clinton campaign.

{"text":"Refugee resettlement putting America at risk: insert picture Maryland\u2019s diminutive and unassuming private citizen, Ann Corcoran, has been writing about refugee resettlement on her now-famous blog, Refugee Resettlement Watch, since 2007. Without her work it is highly doubtful we would know nearly as much about this dangerous and wildly out-of-control program. To know her, listen to her, watch her on TV, she reminds you of a kindly grandmother, (which she is), quietly but assertively lecturing us to eat our porridge. You could never imagine the ire she has aroused among the radical Left and their allies in the refugee resettlement industry. But she has. Southern Poverty Law Center have branded her an Islamophobe She wrote a short book three years ago, Refugee Resettlement and the Hijra to America, which is still in the top 30 in the immigration category at Amazon. A short video produced to promote the book has been viewed over 2.9 million times. Her blog has thousands of entries on everything from the refugee resettlement budget and the despotic, arcane, and highly secretive process by which refugees are resettled into this nation, to the horrific crimes and terrorism committed by these nice refugees that we foolish deplorables are so worried about. Her work inspired me to write my own short (and not nearly as popular) book, The Red-Green Axis, and the (not nearly as popular) promotional video to go with it. But to listen to the Left, you would never know she is a kindly grandmother. Perish the thought! The extreme left-wing smear merchants at the Southern Poverty Law Center have branded her an Islamophobe. Her blog is even mentioned in a pamphlet published by the private resettlement industry itself, titled Resettlement at Risk: Meeting Emerging Challenges to Refugee Resettlement in Local Communities. Yes folks, she is one of those \u201cemerging challenges.\u201d She even attended a meeting in Pennsylvania where representatives of the U.S. State Department and HHS\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement spoke of \u201cpockets of resistance\u201d to refugee resettlement cropping up around the country. We know that many of those \u201cpockets\u201d became motivated by following Ann\u2019s blog. I subsequently organized a group we jokingly called the \u201cpockets of resistance\u201d to mock the industry. But they were no joke. One of those \u201cpockets\u201d recently threw out a five-term mayor who ignored public sentiment on refugees. Yes to all you refugee resettlement industry \u201cstakeholders,\u201d we natives who pay for all of this crap are getting restless. To be clear here, refugees are resettled in the U.S. through a network of nine primary and 320 affiliate private contractors paid by the head to resettle refugees. In other words, the federal government incentivizes them to resettle ever more refugees in an endless stream. Fraud in the refugee and asylum programs is off the charts.

{"text":"K-12: The Schools You Deserve: insert picture Thomas Jefferson declared: \u201cThe government you elect is the government you deserve.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t the same go for a school system? If you select it, you must deserve it. Plato said an early version of what would later be attributed to Edmund Burke: \u201cThe penalty good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men.\u201d Albert Einstein put it this way: \u201cThe world is in greater peril from those who tolerate or encourage evil than from those who actually commit it.\u201d In education, we have a startling amount of tolerating and encouraging. What part is our responsibility? If we allow left-wing social engineers to take over our country and dumb down our children, maybe we are substantially to blame. It might not be accurate to say we select these people. But we do put up with them. A third party observing us might well conclude we prefer it this way. Jefferson\u2019s quote seem to suggest a cosmic morality or karmic reality that will inevitably reward or punish us. I think with the education people, the logic is a lot sloppier. They\u2019re like a second cousin, not a very attractive person, and he shows up at your door and asks if he can stay the night. His car is broken down. A month later he is still there. You didn\u2019t do anything to deserve this. But you did accept him in your house for a day. You never made him leave. That\u2019s what education officials have somehow achieved. We\u2019re supposed to believe their ruinous presence is normal, is good for us, and good for children. All of which is dubious. These education commissars are arguably a costly drag on the country. Maybe he\u2019s not even a real cousin, merely abusing the claimed relationship. Maybe it\u2019s like Six Degrees of Separation where a stranger tangles you up in lies. Remember that movie? Here\u2019s the story: \u201cAn affluent New York couple find their lives touched, intruded upon, and compelled by a mysterious young black man who is never quite who he says he is.\u201d That would be actor Will Smith. In short, he is a lot like the entire Education Establishment and its behavior toward this country for the last hundred years. Claiming to know all about education. No, they apparently don\u2019t. Claiming to be concerned about your children. No, not much at all. Claiming to care about this great country. Yes, they care about transforming it fundamentally, just as Obama promised to do. We are never sure what Will Smith is up to. But we suspect he is hanging around to take advantage of us. If we don\u2019t ask him to leave, then it\u2019s our fault. All that\u2019s required for evil men to succeed is that good men do nothing. This seems to be the essence of our problem. Not enough people did something. Not enough people said, I\u2019m mad as hell and I\u2019m not taking it anymore. The rough figure is that the US has 50 million functional illiterates. Maybe if all the young people were completely illiterate, the older people might start to get angry. What actually would it take? Alzheimer's-Blocking \"Super Coffee\" May Be The \"Memory Saving Discovery\" Of The Century Yes, that is the vital question: what would awaken the American people? As it is now, we drift along in a slumber. The media are silent. The Ivy League universities are silent. The foundations are silent. The frog in the not-quite-boiling water is silent. When we stand back and observe our Education Establishment, we are dumbfounded by their audacity. Imagine that John Dewey and colleagues would think of taking over the ed schools in order to take over the country. That they would render children unable to read (this is my conclusion) as a passport to a socialist paradise. They are indeed saucy baggage. They deserve a big dose of contempt. There can be few more useless human beings than those who prattle on about educational advancement while the children are mugged into silence. Almost as bad are the good citizens who allow them to prattle on. So much of what we call educational theory is nothing but marketing. They make up some new mumbo-jumbo such as New Math; and they say this is the ultimate method, just what your kids need. Everything the education professors come up with is presented to the public in this amazing end-of-history language. Finally, they claim, true education is at last triumphant. That\u2019s how we got Sight-words, Reform Math, Constructivism, and much more. Five years later all the kids are a little dumber. But the parents are somehow kept in line. Which brings us back to the punchline. If good people do nothing, bad people will prevail. That is the story of public school education in the 20th century. There has been a lot of prevailing going on. The Education Establishment\u2019s great triumph is to make themselves appear safe, not too threatening, somehow not prime players. All their bad theories and methods somehow turn up on their own, unlucky accidents. There is the big mistake that Americans make. The Education Establishment controls what goes on in K-12 classrooms. Give these people credit, and then give them blame and punishment. If we don\u2019t, then we deserve the schools we end up with. Is it time for President Trump to leave the White House? ","label":1}
{"text":"Why The Anti-Trump \u201cResistance\u201d Is So Relentless: insert picture I revisited election night videos on youtube of Leftists\u2019 tearful meltdowns in response to Trump defeating Hillary. http:\/\/bit.ly\/2xo0l5f Their panic, outrage and hatred for Trump was over-the-top; truly amazing. I questioned, why was it so intense? I am a black, Christian conservative. Trump is not ideological. Still, I thought Trump leaned more in the Leftists\u2019 camp than in mine. I viewed Trump as a businessman, busy pursuing his American dream, not concerned with the war between liberals and conservatives. Trump simply saw Obama making bad deals for America and knew he could do better. Trump was not overly concerned with social issues, but knew it was weird that Americans were no longer permitted to say, \u201c Merry Christmas!\u201d So Trump decided to get into the presidential race. Political elites and fake news media thought the idea of Donald J. Trump in the White House was the joke of the century. And where on earth did Trump come up with his cornball, obviously un-poll tested, campaign phrase, \u201cMake America great again\u201d? Due to public schools teaching distortions and lies about American history, Leftists are obsessed with bringing down our country from her throne as the world power. This is why Trump proclaiming his desire to \u201cmake America great again\u201d repulsed and enraged Leftists. Leftists have flooded fake news media with their absurd despicable lie that \u201cmake America great again\u201d is code for white supremacy, social injustice, cops free to murder blacks, destroying the planet and so on. Dethroning America is Leftists\u2019 number one priority. The second most important thing in the world to Leftists appears to be sex and transforming America into a culture in which anything goes sexually. Leftists have been using government to force sexual deviancy down our throats. You cannot turn on TV without being slapped in the face with various forms of sexual deviancy. We have been trained not to complain about it if we know what is good for us. Third on the Leftists\u2019 list of priorities is having as many Americans as possible kill their babies to save the planet. CNN Hopes You Never See This Hillary Video","label":1}

{"text":"Russia Russia Russia: Since the mass media (and therefore public opinion) is swamped with the Russia Russia Russia propaganda, here's a quick synopsis of all the *facts* you sadly can't find on our American television or \"news\" outlets: To begin with, our elections are anything but democratic or un-influenced. The party representatives are selected by very small groups of wealthy people, who also maintain the chosen loyalist (ie, financially-incentivized) pool of \"Superdelegates\" for counteracting the wills of *entire states*. When the DNC was sued their court defense was that they have no actual obligation to perform fair elections. They repealed every protection possible against unlimited or foreign campaign donations and lobbying. Every news outlet was Trump 24\/7 in an attempt to win it for Hillary through \"lesser evilism\"- a theory Democrats use often, but which backfired. Forced to choose between two hated millionaires, stuck between the establishment corruption or a liar's claim of anti-establishmentism, left this country totally divided. But the numbers don't lie. The problem was that neither of these warmongering, egomaniac corporatists represented the people. For a country that facilitates daily atrocities on foreign ground by using the excuse of \"defending democracy,\" we don't actually practice it. Such direct control is referred to as \"mob rule\", and to be stopped at all costs for the \"good\" of the country. Or, at least for the good of wealthy politicians, lobbyists, and businesses who profit off our military industrial complex. What Russia was accused of doing is merely running a phishing scheme which 'resulted' in Wikileaks airing an email assortment of the DNC's dirty laundry. Ignoring all content (because that would lay some blame at their own feet) and ignoring the polls (which all predicted a Clinton loss against Trump) it became the DNC's go-to excuse that Russian interference was the reason for their loss. Then Hillary-backing three-letter agencies signed off on their \"it looks like it could be the kind of attack that one might expect to see from Russian hackers\" report, which then got blown up into \"Russia hacked our election\" through media hype, obfuscation, and repetition. That was the entire source of the supposed moral outrage, and honestly it's entirely hypocritical when we consider how many foreign elections or even entire governments those same agencies have been manipulating with economic and military impunity. Maybe some are OK with corruption, as long as it is only *us* doing it. I'm not. Why should I have more fear from Russia's \"influence\" than those actively accepting bribes? Does domestic tyranny really come second to any conveniently imagined foreign scapegoat? And why should I believe the word of the same folk proven to (in their own leaked words) have maintained this duplicitous \"public and private face\"? I am not anti-American, a secret spy, or a Republican by saying that Russian election talk is wasting our time and just makes us useful idiots to the Democratic-funded new \"activism\" which re-frames our problems with a couple quick historical rewrites and anti-Trump false nationalism. This country is getting split up into factions; remaining divided, those in power stay in power, while we blame everyone else. Yet fixing our governmental and electoral corruption would mean nobody has to worry about Russia. All this inflammatory Red Scare rhetoric simply protects our own domestic terrorists, who still claim without any evidence to be our \"democratic representatives\". The media-hyped foreign redirection should give us deja vu, and frankly be obvious to any citizen remotely familiar with our history. Or even just to anyone who was actually involved in, or paying attention to the election. If you get your understanding of reality from the sponsored infotainment of American network's broadcasting, unfortunately you're woefully under- and mis-informed. Greatest of all ironies, to believe in this Russian nonsense is to be a conspiracy theorist of the highest order. Yet time and moneyed agendas have been manipulating to hide the underlying truth- that the greatest threat to our country are the politicians who incite war just to retain power.","label":1}
{"text":"Why Do Radical Muslims Hate America So Much?: Americans know that the United States has been engaged in the War on Terror for the past 10 years. But how many Americans can answer the question of why radical Muslims hate us so much? The United States has spent nearly $1.3 trillion on the war effort \u2013 a figure that dwarfs the Vietnam War ($738 billion), the Korean War ($341 billon), and World War I ($334 billion). And the United States has lost more than 6,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. But again, can the average American explain why radical Muslims attacked the twin towers on Sept. 11, 2011, and why terrorist groups continue to recruit and scheme to attack us? Most likely the answer is no. Jim Denison, a cultural apologist and former senior pastor of the 10,000-member Park Cities Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, sets out to answer that question in his new book Radical Islam: What You Need to Know. According to Denison, who has lived and traveled among Muslims for some 30 years, there are two major parts to the answer. The first part is radical Muslims claim that the West has been attacking Islam since the crusades, with Pope Urban II announcing the First Crusade in 1095. The First Crusade began the West\u2019s attack on the \u201cummah,\u201d or collective community of Muslims worldwide that transcends geography and time. An attack on any of Islam\u2019s followers is seen as an attack on all Muslims because the ummah, or community, is attacked. British-American historian Bernard Lewis, Cleveland E. Dodge professor emeritus of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, writes in his 2004 book, The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror: \"In the Western world, the basic unit of human organization is the nation, in America but not European usage virtually synonymous with country. This is then subdivided in various ways, one of which is by religion. Muslims, however, tend to see not a nation subdivided into religious groups but a religion subdivided into nations.\" With this logic, the United States\u2019 support of Israel in the conflict with Palestinians is seen as America\u2019s attack on all Muslims worldwide. \u201cThe Quran requires Muslims to defend Islam. So if you believe we are attacking Islam then as a Muslim you are required to attack us in defense of your faith,\u201d explained Denison about radical Muslims\u2019 worldview to The Christian Post. Osama bin Laden published a \u201cLetter to America\u201don Nov. 24, 2002, which says this much regarding why al-Qaida attacked the United States. \u201cThe answer is very simple: Because you attacked us and continue to attack us,\u201d bin Laden stated in the letter. Extremists also claim the United States attacks Islam not only by supporting Israel and with our military presence in the Middle East, but also by exporting our culture through movies, music, the Internet, and other forms of mass communication. \u201cThey see all of that as an imposition of a hedonist, secular culture on the Muslim world. In their world, at least in most of the Muslim world, there is not a significant distinction between faith and life, between church and state as we might say,\u201d Denison notes. The second major reason to the question of why radical Muslims hate America is based on their understanding of democracy. Because the American people elect the U.S. government and our taxes support the military, Muslim extremists hold American civilians accountable for the \u201cwar on Islam.\u201d \u201cThere are no innocent civilians. They see us the way you would see Germans who supported Hitler or Japanese who supported the emperor,\u201d Denison explained. \u201cIn their minds, you and I are complicit in this attack on Islam.\u201d \u201cIn the mind of a radical Muslim, 9\/11 was not an unprovoked attack on Americans. 9\/11 was a defense of Islam, striking back at the heart of Western crusader, imperialist aggression; the twin towers \u2013 financial; Pentagon \u2013 military; White House \u2013 political.\u201d Again, Osama Bin Laden\u2019s \u201cLetter to America\u201d points to the U.S.\u2019s system of democracy to explain why American civilians are guilty for the deaths of Palestinian Muslims and those in Afghanistan, Somalia, Chechnya and Kashmir. But the vast majority of Muslims in the world are peaceful. The Gallup poll conducted the largest-ever survey of predominantly Islamic countries after the Sept. 11 attacks and found 7 percent of the Muslim world has been radicalized. That means 93 percent of Muslims in the world are peaceful. But that also means that 7 percent of 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, which translates to 112 million Muslims, are radical. \u201cWe need to understand that it (radical Islam) is an enemy unlike any we have ever fought, and this is a war unlike any we have fought. Osama bin Laden was not Hitler. They are not seeking to defend a single city like Berlin. There is not a single leader with whom we can negotiate a truce,\u201d stated Denison. \u201cThis is the battle of our lifetime. In fact, many scholars are beginning to call it the long war. \u201cWe are going to face terrorism just as we face cancer, wildfires, and floods. I am afraid that it is simply going to be part of life in the 21st century.\u201d Denison, who founded the Denison Forum on Truth and Culture in 2009, suggests the United States continue to build relationships with moderate Muslim nations, encourage democracy in the world, promote economic progress in the Muslim world, help negotiate peace in the Middle East, and remain vigilant against terrorist threats.

Al Sharpton Advocates for Removal of one of America's Most Iconic Monuments: After this weekend\u2019s violence took place in Charlottesville, Virginia, resulting in the death of three people and the injuries of many others, debates have been stirring about the original source of the controversy- the removal of Confederate monuments. After the swift removal of statues in Baltimore on Tuesday night, a college student was arrested for her participation in vandalism, and Gettysburg made a major statement about removals, many prominent voices have begun to share their opinions on the matter. President Trump delivered a press conference in the Trump Tower where he addressed the issue head on. He said, \u201cThis week, it is Robert E. Lee and this week, Stonewall Jackson. Is it George Washington next? You have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\u201d He said that if people are advocating for the removal of some statues, they should also want to remove the Washington Monument and Jefferson Memorial since both men were slave owners. According to the Daily Wire, that is exactly what Rev. Al Sharpton is advocating for. He complained to Charlie Rose that the Jefferson Memorial, in particular, is an \u201cinsult to [his] family\u201d and that he is fully in support of its removal. His main concern is that these monuments are supported by public funds. He said that because of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s history as a slave owner, paying for his monument is a direct insult.

{"text":"How We're Dehumanizing Muslim Filipinos With This ID: IMAGE Gabby Jimenez In 1919, the Supreme Court validated the Philippine government\u2019s action of forcing the Mangyans (manguianes) to live in a reservation or camp based on the logic that our indigenous brothers and sisters from Mindoro were \u201cuncivilized.\u201d Filipinos were thus divided into civilized and uncivilized, where the latter was deprived of their right to liberty. In 1939, the Supreme Court again upheld the logic that our indigenous brothers and sisters were uncivilized when it affirmed the conviction of a native of Baguio for illegal possession of intoxicating liquor, a drink apparently only civilized people can handle. Fast forward to 2000, when the Supreme Court upheld the validity of the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997 and finally gave dignity to the humanity of our indigenous brothers and sisters. But which historical fate will our Muslim brothers and sisters meet? I hope we don\u2019t experience d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. The Police Regional Director of Central Luzon, Senior Supt. Aaron Aquino, plans to issue mandatory IDs that all Muslim residents must obtain and wear in the region. Such a plan is already being implemented in Paniqui, Tarlac, according to Human Rights Watch. The supposedly lofty goal is to \u201cidentify and weed out undesirable individuals and terrorists.\u201d PNP Chief Ronald \u201cBato\u201d Dela Rosa doesn\u2019t see any problem with the plan.  A Muslim-only ID would be a denial of the guarantee of equal protection.  But no goal will ever justify discrimination and violation of people\u2019s rights\u2014and the logic behind this is highly questionable to begin with. A Muslim-only ID perpetuates if not cements the notion that only Muslims are and can be terrorists. The frequent, unquestioned use by irresponsible journalists of the labels \u201cIslamic terrorist\u201d or \u201cMuslim terrorist\u201d in their news reports have indeed created a false association between being a Muslim and being a terrorist. The logic is painfully obvious: not all Muslims are terrorists and not all terrorists are Muslims. The National People\u2019s Army (NPA) frequently commits terrorism when it commits crime to demand revolutionary taxes or issues some other illegal demand. But the media doesn\u2019t report the crimes as being committed by \u201catheist terrorists\u201d or \u201cChristian terrorists,\u201d even if some members of the NPA are atheist or Christian. For example, the so-called Manila hostage crisis in 2010 technically falls under the legal definition of terrorism\u2014committing a crime with the purpose of sowing fear and panic to coerce the government to give in to an unlawful demand. But the media called it a hostage crisis, not terrorism. And the media didn\u2019t inquire into the hostage taker\u2019s religion. To really identify and weed out undesirable individuals and terrorists, we must recognize that terrorists can come from any religious background. If an ID system would help, it would help to make it mandatory for everyone. To impose it only on our Muslim brothers and sisters would be discriminatory and illegal. A Muslim-only ID would violate our laws and the Constitution, which guarantees basic human rights. I can give a litany of laws that would be violated, but let\u2019s limit it to two. First, Article III Section 1 of the Constitution says: \u201cNo person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the law.\u201d A Muslim-only ID would be a deprivation of liberty of Muslim Filipinos without due process. Due process here means that there should be a rational connection between the goal the government wants to achieve and the means it uses to try and achieve that goal. It\u2019s painfully obvious again that there is no rational connection\u2014anyone can be a terrorist, not only Muslims. And belief in Islam or being a Muslim doesn\u2019t make a person a terrorist. There are many peace-loving and law-abiding Muslim Filipinos and very few Muslim terrorists\u2014again, a label that some journalists irresponsibly use (they should really stop using that). A Muslim-only ID would be a denial of the guarantee of equal protection. While the government can classify people and treat them differently in other instances (senior citizens, for example), such treatment should be based on substantial distinction. There is no rhyme or reason in classifying Muslims or Christians\u2014or any other religion for that matter\u2014differently. Again: there is nothing to distinguish a Muslim from a Christian in their likelihood to be a criminal or terrorist. There is nothing. Nothing.  Again: there is nothing to distinguish a Muslim from a Christian in their likelihood to be a criminal or terrorist. There is nothing. Nothing.  Second, Article III Section 5 of the Constitution says: \u201cNo religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or political rights.\u201d Under our laws, the right to travel is part of our civil rights. A Muslim-only ID would require a religious test for the followers of Islam so they can exercise their right to travel\u2014such as evacuating and fleeing from Marawi and resettling in Central Luzon. The Philippines will seem to be endorsing Christianity or other religions for Filipinos given that their exercise of their right to travel is easier if they weren\u2019t Muslims and weren\u2019t required to register and wear an ID. But regardless of the legality, to impose a Muslim-only ID would lead us further down the path that Hitler and Nazi Germany took. Is this alarmist? How I wish. The Nazis required Jews to wear a yellow badge or the Star of David so they could easily be identified. This heightened, if not cemented, Germany\u2019s anti-Semitism and contributed to the tragedy that is the Holocaust. You see, one of the main reasons why people can and do massacre other people is because of dehumanization. When people are stripped of their humanity and made out to be different from you, it is easy for these people to become the \u201cother.\u201d Someone else we don\u2019t need to care about. Someone else we can treat differently because they are not like us. They are not humans. And so we must stop dehumanization in any form. Drug addicts have already been dehumanized and are being tagged in barangay watch lists. Muslims are now in danger of being dehumanized and tagged with a Muslim-only ID system. The dignity and humanity of all people must be respected. Otherwise, our own dignity and humanity will be in danger. If a Muslim-only ID is further implemented beyond Central Luzon, I will stand in solidarity with our Muslim brothers and sisters. I will register as a Muslim. I will register as a human being.","label":1}

{"text":"Christian nationalism: Good for politicians the world: By Peter Montgomery Why did white evangelicals support Trump? To keep America Christian. White evangelical Christians voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump, despite his well-documented character flaws and moral failings. It turns out that their support wasn\u2019t just about hatred of Hillary Clinton or Trump\u2019s promise to give them the Supreme Court of their dreams. A new study points to another more disturbing motivating force: Christian nationalism. The study was conducted by scholars at Clemson University, East Tennessee State, and the University of Oklahoma. \u201cThe more someone believed the United States is \u2014 and should be \u2014 a Christian nation, the more likely they were to vote for Trump,\u201d the researchers found. The scholars looked at whether people agreed or disagreed with half a dozen statements, such as \u201cThe federal government should declare the United States a Christian nation.\u201d Voters who scored high on that scale believed that \u201cTrump would defend what they saw as the country\u2019s Christian heritage \u2014 and would help move the nation toward a distinctly Christian future,\u201d the study\u2019s authors wrote in a Washington Post column. The only other cultural explanation that predicted voting behavior so powerfully was the level of fear and antagonism toward Muslims. Of course, the two are not unrelated. Some Christian-nation advocates promote false history, claiming that the First Amendment\u2019s protections for religious liberty were meant only for Christians. Some prominent conservative activists argue that American Muslims are not protected by the First Amendment, going so far as to claim that Islam is not even a religion, or that Muslims cannot truthfully take an oath to uphold the Constitution. Sad to say, these attitudes aren\u2019t restricted to a few folks out on the far fringes. The Family Research Council, for example, hosts an annual gathering of Christian conservative activists that Trump has attended both as candidate and as president. FRC president Tony Perkins has gushed about how often he\u2019s invited to the White House, and former FRC staffers have taken influential jobs in the administration. Perkins defended Trump\u2019s 2015 call for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S., saying that \u201conly 16 percent of Islam is a religion \u2014 the rest is a combination of military, judicial, economic, and political system.\u201d Perkins\u2019 colleague and FRC\u2019s executive vice president, retired General Jerry Boykin, has a long track record of anti-Muslim rhetoric, including the claims that Islam is not a religion and that Muslims don\u2019t deserve First Amendment protections. Rhetoric that implies that \u201creal\u201d Americans are Christian \u2014 like rhetoric that implies that \u201creal\u201d Americans are white \u2014 isn\u2019t only wrong, it\u2019s dangerous. Rhetorical attacks on immigrants and Muslims by Trump and his allies, and the promotion of anti-Semitic tropes by some of his fans in the alt-right, have contributed to a spike in anti-Semitic incidents and hate crimes directed at immigrants, Muslims, and even people wrongly perceived by attackers to be immigrants or Muslims. That harm isn\u2019t just limited to people in the United States, either. At a recent event sponsored by Georgetown University\u2019s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, former diplomats warned that the rise in religious intolerance at home \u2014 specifically anti-Muslim bigotry and ethno-nationalism \u2014 threatens the ability of the United States to advocate effectively for the human rights of religious minorities facing sometimes brutal repression in other parts of the world. One speaker added that the rise in anti-Muslim bigotry in the U.S. acts as a recruiting tool for terrorist organizations. Rejecting America\u2019s commitment to religious pluralism is therefore not only a betrayal of American values, which contributes to a growing climate of intolerance in the United States. It also represents the abandonment of people around the world who look to America and American ideals for hope. Peter Montgomery is a senior fellow at People For the American Way.

{"text":"Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway monument tarred and feathered: GOLD CANYON, Ariz. (KSAZ) - The Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway Monument that sits in the far East Valley has been tarred and feathered. An investigation is ongoing. The monument sits near Gold Canyon along the U.S. 60, just north of the Renaissance Festival. The monument bears the name of Jefferson Davis, who was the first and only president of the Confederate States of America. \"Somebody had to put a little thought into it, but this is going to cost a lot of money to clean up,\" said John Rogers in Mesa. The blackened and feathered monument drew some visitors. Some of them took a rather dim view of the damage. \"It is vandalism,\" said Tom Hill of Mesa. \"This is state property. State property. It is vandalism. The state controls this.\" This is the second monument to be defaced in the past several days. The Confederate Troops Memorial outside the Arizona Capitol was spray painted white sometime before Thursday morning. Confederate monuments around the country have been removed or defaced since the weekend as the country grapples with a violent rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where white nationalists and white supremacists protested plans to remove a statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee. Black leaders have called for the removal of such monuments for several years, saying they glorify racism.

{"text":"The Magical Thinking Opposition: My hypothesis is that the political side that is out of power is the one that hallucinates the most \u2014 and needs to \u2014 in order to keep their worldview intact. For example, when President Obama was in office, I saw all kinds of hallucinations on the right about his intentions to destroy America from the inside because he \u201chates\u201d it. That was a mass hysteria. If President Obama wanted to destroy America, he failed miserably. We\u2019re stronger than ever. The birther issue started as ordinary political shenanigans to delegitimize the president. I call it ordinary because you see the trick used whenever it is an option, as it was with \u201cCanadian\u201d Ted Cruz in the primaries. Eventually it morphed into a full-blown hallucination that President Obama was a Muslim sleeper cell from Kenya, or something like that. That was mass hysteria. Now that Democrats are out of power, we should expect them to hallucinate like crazy (literally) because the election results of 2016 shattered their expectations. Do we see signs of their hallucinations? I\u2019ll walk you through a few examples. Hallucination: Based on President Trump\u2019s tweets and speeches, I can see into his soul, and it is all darkness and racism in there. Real: If the President of the United States tries anything racist in the real world, the Supreme Court, Congress, and the voters would shut him down in a heartbeat. For example, the Courts modified President Trump\u2019s immigration ban to remove even the perception of racism. That\u2019s a sensitive filter for racism, and I think we like it that way. Society\u2019s standard is that you are judged for what you do, not what you privately think. That\u2019s good because humans are terrible at knowing what other people think, while at the same time we think we are good at it. I know this first-hand because dozens of people misinterpret what I write on social media every day. If you don\u2019t have my type of experience \u2014 of being routinely misinterpreted \u2014 you might think humans are good at reading minds based on subtle clues. We are not good at that. We might be slightly better than random chance, at best. The problem is that we are dead-certain we are champions of evidence-based mindreading. That is a hallucination. Hallucination: I can spot a racist by how long it takes them to properly disavow other racists. Real: That isn\u2019t a thing. The first rule of communicating is that people only hear what they think you intend to say. They don\u2019t hear what you actually say. If you think someone is a racist, you will perceive their disavowals of racism as too late and too inadequate. If you think someone is not a racist, you might see their statements as politically incorrect and nothing worse. This phenomenon is most pronounced when strong emotions are involved. The topic of racism stirs our strongest emotions. So according to everything we know about brains, we should expect the highest level of hallucinations when racism is the topic. And that is exactly what we observe. To be clear, racism itself is very real. The hallucination is limited to seeing it under every bed and behind every couch. Hallucination: The president has accomplished nothing! Real: The president has accomplished a long list of things. That said, we are 13% into President Trump\u2019s first term, and Congress has created no major bills worthy of signing. Congress is tasked with working out the details of bills. The president can\u2019t do his job until they do theirs. We observe that the president has not shown leadership on any major legislation. But keep in mind that Congress produced nothing worthy of leadership. Would any leader be able to fix that? Yes, but I assume it takes longer than simply signing bills that come to your desk. Especially in this hyper-polarized environment. Hallucination: President Trump is performing poorly! Real: Compared to what? The imaginary president in your head? There is no base case with which to compare any president\u2019s performance. Would Hillary Clinton have passed major legislation with a Republican Congress in less than six months? It seems unlikely. But we can\u2019t know because she isn\u2019t president. We are terrible at judging how well a stranger performs compared to the imaginary person in our minds. We just think we are good at it. Hallucination: If you thought some \u201cfine people\u201d were marching with Nazis and KKK in Charlottesville, you are a racist. Real: I condemn all racists and anyone who marches with them. But It turns out that some non-racists were at the event to support the absolute right of free speech, including the worst kinds of speech. In this one case, President Trump passed the fact-checking but failed miserably on the \u201csaying the right thing\u201d dimension. He wisely left the facts alone after failing on the empathy. Hallucination: This country needs moral leadership and we are not getting it! Real: The country does not need moral leadership in 2017. Social media has filled that void. The country is unified (let\u2019s say 98%) in condemning the KKK and other racists in Charlottesville. We did that without moral leadership. We want moral leadership, but there is no evidence we need it. We would also like to know our president has the right intentions. But hallucinations on that topic are nearly unfixable. Obama never fixed it. Trump will not either. Hallucination: The way you worded your statement, you made a moral equivalence between the KKK and people protesting the KKK. Real: Literally no one but the KKK and other extreme racists has any trouble understanding that Nazis are worse than the people protesting against hate. It is a hallucination (or political tricksterism) to suggest normal citizens can\u2019t distinguish the moral difference between Nazis and those demonstrating against racism. I could go on, but I think you are starting to see the picture. The party out of power has to hallucinate to make their world make sense. The people who think they are smart and morally pure don\u2019t understand why their side lost an election. The simplest fix for that broken worldview is to imagine there are far more \u201csecret racists\u201d than they first assumed, and those people can be identified by the way they accidentally reveal their \u201cmoral equivalence\u201d opinions that look exactly like law-and-order opinions to others. I could go on, but I think you get the idea. Cognitive dissonance hits the losing team hardest. It has to, because only the losing side need to make sense of it all. The winning side thinks things are going exactly as expected. They have no trigger for hallucinating. If our next president is a Democrat, expect the Right to do most of the hallucinating. The Left will think things are going as expected. Update: If you are still confident you can read President Trump\u2019s inner thoughts because of the clear pattern of racist acts he has committed, see if this article about the Central Park 5 shakes your confidence in what you thought you knew. Remember, President Trump is not the only person good at persuasion. The opposition is running on all cylinders. \u2014 I wrote some books you might enjoy because you love books you enjoy.","label":1}
{"text":"A Protection Racket Wrapped in a Cover-up: insert picture Is the entire Mueller investigation a false flag distraction to cover the tracks of the people who really did attempt to undermine an American presidential election? Some background to this part of the plot must include the fact that the former FBI Director James Comey has admitted to illegally leaking transcripts of privileged conversations with the President to the press. Why did he do it? Comey testified before a Senate Committee that he orchestrated the leak of accounts of conversations with President Donald Trump because he thought it might lead to the appointment of a special prosecutor to lead the Russia investigation. In an interesting twist Deputy Attorney General, Rod J. Rosenstein in a memo to the President on May 9, 2017 after outlining the improper actions of James Comey with regard to the investigation of Hillary\u2019s emails stated, \u201cAlthough the President has the power to remove an FBI director, the decision should not be taken lightly. I agree with the nearly unanimous opinions of former Department officials. The way the Director handled the conclusion of the email investigation was wrong. As a result, the FBI is unlikely to regain public and congressional trust until it has a Director who understands the gravity of the mistakes and pledges never to repeat them. Having refused to admit his errors, the Director cannot be expected to implement the necessary corrective actions.\u201d Accepting this counsel President Trump fired FBI Director Comey. Then Deputy Attorney General, Rod J. Rosenstein appointed Mueller as Special Counsel to investigate Trump based on his firing of Comey. President Trump knows what\u2019s going on. In his famous tweet where he labeled Mueller\u2019s fishing expedition a \u201cWitch Hunt\u201d he said \u201cI am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director!\u201d Mueller, who is up to his eyeballs in Hillary\u2019s Russian scams, has weaponized criminal law in the convoluted attempt of the Progressive cult to misdirect the public. The denizens of the swamp never expected Hillary to lose. They never thought there was any chance of their nefarious and perhaps treasonous schemes to stack the deck and short circuit the electoral processes. But in a shocking twist the electoral system designed by our founders worked and the united people out here in fly-over country were able to thwart the bi-coastal fix when the fix was supposedly in.

{"text":"Hillary: Investigating me would be a symptom of a \u2018dictatorship, like some authoritarian regime\u2019: insert picture If there\u2019s one thing the Clintons have always been able to count on, it\u2019s that they\u2019re above the law. The rules that apply to the little people Hillary so despises have never been applied to her own family. Time will tell if that\u2019s really going to change but, now that their political power is on the wane, it at least appears as if their ability to dodge the consequences of their actions has diminished. The other day, Dan wrote about the New York Times\u2019s previously unimaginable decision to call out Bill\u2019s history of sexual predation. That alone may not seem like much but, since the Times was once a reliable mouthpiece for the Clintons, it says volumes about their current lack of influence. Uranium One scandal Then there\u2019s that pesky Uranium One scandal. Despite media efforts to portray the whole thing as conspiracy theory, there are still plenty of questions regarding the Russian money that flowed to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary was Secretary of State. In fact, there are enough questions that rumors of a special council persist - this despite Trey Gowdy\u2019s comments yesterday. So, the fine, upstanding, leftists over at Mother Jones decided to ask Mrs. Clinton about the possibility that she might finally face a thorough investigation. Her answer, as you\u2019d expect, is 100% wrong. From Mother Jones:  Hillary Clinton responded on Wednesday to news that the Trump administration is considering appointing a special counsel to investigate her alleged ties to the Uranium One deal, calling the move \u201ca disastrous step into politicizing the Justice Department\u201d and \u201csuch an abuse of power.\u201d In an exclusive interview with Mother Jones, Clinton said such an investigation would have devastating consequences for the justice system in America. \u201cIf they send a signal that we\u2019re going to be like some dictatorship, like some authoritarian regime, where political opponents are going to be unfairly, fraudulently investigated, that rips at the fabric of the contract we have, that we can trust our justice system,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIt will be incredibly demoralizing to people who have served at the Justice Department, under both Republicans and Democrats, because they know better. But it will also send a terrible signal to our country and the world that somehow we are giving up on the kind of values that we used to live by and we used to promote worldwide.\u201d  First, the \u201cJustice System in America\u201d is built on the notion that no one - not even the saintly Clinton family - is above its reach. If there\u2019s reason to investigate Hillary, and God knows there are probably at least half a dozen, then so be it. The idea that, somehow, applying the law to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s actions would damage the justice system is ludicrous. Letting people dodge culpability and enjoy the fruits of their transgressions simply because they have the right last name? Now that damages our faith in the justice system - and Hillary  ; Co. have been doing it for decades. Second, James Comey\u2019s decision not to prosecute Mrs. Clinton - after laying out a detailed list of prosecutable offenses - damaged American faith in the justice system far more that any special counsel ever could. Finally, if Hillary really wants to examine who\u2019s been using the DOJ as a weapon, she should look no further than the Obama administration in which she served. From Fast  ; Furious, to a refusal to enforce laws it didn\u2019t like, to \u201c slush funds,\u201d to the mysterious Loretta Lynch tarmac meeting, the Obama-era DOJ was an eight-year morass of dubious decisions and political maneuvering. Holder even ended up being held in contempt of Congress - while being simultaneously praised by his President. In short, it was about as shady as it could get, and deserves to be the target of a few investigations of its own. Hillary\u2019s game has always been to portray herself as the target of wild-eyed right-wing conspiracies. She\u2019s been doing it since the early nineties. If there was any actual Justice left in this government, her victim card would be revoked, and she\u2019d find herself at the center of multiple investigations. So please, Mrs. Clinton, knock it off.

{"text":"Mouth control, not more gun control, is what we need: Has-been Nancy Sinatra. She wants NRA members to be shot While the left side of the political spectrum responded to the mass shooting in Las Vegas with fevered calls for gun controls, which even Democrats admit would not have prevented the massacre, they have done nothing to rein in their hateful rhetoric demonizing Trump supporters and providing clear incitements to deranged individuals like Stephen Paddock to commit heinous acts of violence. Leftist celebrity Nancy Sinatra notoriously tweeted \u201cMurderous members of NRA should face firing squad\u201d \u2013 to express her politically correct assumption that a gun, rather than an individual incited by hateful comments like hers, was responsible for the slaughter. Nor are Democrats unaware that their reckless rhetorical attacks can have deadly results Nor are Democrats unaware that their reckless rhetorical attacks can have deadly results. Republican Congressman Steve Scalise nearly lost his life at the hands of a Bernie Sanders supporting Democrat, James T. Hodgkinson, during a baseball game this summer. Just last week a local prosecutor officially found that the shooter committed an \u201cact of terrorism\u201d that was \u201cfueled by rage against Republican legislators.\u201d Nonetheless Union County, New Jersey Democrat operative James Devine tweetedhis support for the assailant. \u201cWe are in a war with selfish, foolish  ; narcissistic rich people. Why is it a shock when things turn violent?\u201d he wrote, adding the hashtag \u201c#HuntRepublicanCongressmen[.]\u201d This was at least honest. The moment Donald Trump was declared the victor in November, Democrat leaders launched a \u201cResistance\u201d to his presidency. Not a democratic opposition to policies he might enact. But a resistance to his presidency. Consequently Trump was the first president since Abraham Lincoln to get no \u201cpresidential honeymoon.\u201d Congressional Democrats even boycotted his inaugural, and instead of confirmation hearings they mounted a witch-hunt against his nominees, painting colleagues like Jeff Sessions as a \u201cracist\u201d even though they were well aware of his stellar record on civil rights. Instead of uniting the country behind its new duly elected president \u2013 a crucial responsibility of the opposition party in a democracy \u2013 the Democratic leadership then embraced a series of mass \u201cNot My President\u201d protests. The largest of these was the so-called \u201cWomen\u2019s March,\u201d which was held in cities across the country and whose two chief organizers were a convicted Islamic terrorist, Rasmea Odeh, and an Islamic terrorist supporter, Linda Sarsour. Months later, speaking from a platform provided by the Muslim Brotherhood, Sarsour said \u201cI hope, that when we stand up to those who oppress our communities, that Allah accepts from us that as a form of jihad. We are struggling against tyrants and rulers not only abroad in the Middle East but here in the United States of America, where you have fascists and white supremacists and Islamophobes reigning in the White House.\u201d Democrats and their left-wing supporters have been exploiting the tragedy to whip up more hatred against their Republican opponents In Washington the Women\u2019s March featured celebrity entertainer and Hillary supporter Madonna, who, wearing a black pussy hat, announced she had thought \u201can awful lot about blowing up the White House.\u201d At the same demonstration, actress Ashley Judd proclaimed \u201cI am a nasty woman,\u201d then added \u201cI am not as nasty as racism, fraud, conflict of interest, homophobia, sexual assault, transphobia, white supremacy, misogyny, ignorance, white privilege.\u201d A month later, Judd said of Trump\u2019s election victory, \u201cIt remains for me the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my lifetime.\u201d She also grotesquely compared the election result to sexual assault. \u201cRaped as a child \u2013 bad. Re-raped by a political system that ordains a clown \u2013 really bad.\u201d We don\u2019t yet know the motive or motives behind Paddock\u2019s Vegas attack. But the fact that he chose a country and western concert rather than a rock concert or hip-hop event may indicate an animus against possible Trump supporters. Whatever Paddock\u2019s motives, Democrats and their left-wing supporters have been exploiting the tragedy to whip up more hatred against their Republican opponents such as that expressed in Nancy Sinatra\u2019s murderous tweet. Trump\u2019s defeated Democratic opponent, Hillary, was quick to use the massacre as an excuse to bash Republicans and the National Rifle Association (NRA). \u201cThe crowd fled at the sound of gunshots,\u201d she tweeted the morning after. \u201cImagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get.\u201d Of course, a silencer, also called a suppressor, would have melted as a result of the intense heat generated by a continuous-fire weapon and would have only muffled the sound a little. Moreover, a silencer would not conceal the hundreds of wounded victims falling alongside those not yet hit and warning them of the peril they faced. \u201cOur grief isn\u2019t enough,\u201d Clinton added one minute later in an extravagantly hypocritical afterthought. \u201cWe can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again.\u201d Continued below... Democrats project a steady stream of wild-eyed rhetoric and venomous rationales for violence against their political opponents Hillary supporter and CBS executive Hayley Geftman-Gold used the massacre to rant against Trump and Republicans. She blamed Republicans for the deaths caused by Paddock because they wouldn\u2019t endorse stronger gun control as she expressed indifference to the murders because the audience, she guessed, was probably composed of Republicans. \u201cI have no hope that Repugs [sic] will ever do the right thing. I\u2019m actually not even sympathetic [because] country music fans often are Republican gun toters.\u201d CBS executives immediately fired Geftman-Gold, showing a concern for public civility that Democratic Party leaders would do well to emulate. While Democrats call for gun control they project a steady stream of wild-eyed rhetoric and venomous rationales for violence against their political opponents.

{"text":"Who\u2019s winning the NFL vs. Trump battle? One poll says ...: It\u2019s been about three weeks since President Donald Trump ignited an ongoing battle with the NFL over protests during the national anthem. Now, evidence is emerging that his onslaught of tweets and soundbites may be working to change the way people \u2013 if they voted for him in the first place \u2013 see the NFL, the nation\u2019s most popular sports league. The New York Times\u2019 Kevin Quealy showed the trends earlier this week using results of daily online surveys from Morning Consult, a polling, media and technology company. A month ago, people who voted for Hillary Clinton or Trump weren\u2019t far apart \u2013 about 60 percent had a favorable impression of the league and 20 percent negative \u2013 on what they thought about the NFL. Then Trump, at a Sept. 22 rally in Alabama for his choice in a U.S. Senate primary, called for NFL owners to fire players who don\u2019t stand during the national anthem. Since then, the gap between Trump and Clinton voters has spiked, according to the poll. The Trump voters now have a far less favorable opinion \u2013 almost the reverse of where they stood before the president\u2019s speech in Alabama \u2013 of the NFL than the Clinton voters. The gap is so wide now that the NFL now ranks seventh on the list of America\u2019s most divisive brands. What might be more interesting, though probably no more surprising, is that Clinton voters also said they heard or read less negative news about the NFL than the Trump voters. Both groups are reading or seeing more negative stories, but Trump voters are taking in more and even that gap has widened of late. That likely reflects the way many people get their news \u2013 from a source they perceive as promoting their own values, opinions and politics. Trump\u2019s own hotel chain leads the list of most polarizing brands, followed by five media companies \u2013 CNN, NBC News, New York Times, MSNBC and Fox News. The top 15 only includes two other non-media brands, fast-food chain Chick-fil-A and outdoors store Cabela\u2019s. NFL television ratings and stadium attendance also are falling in 2017 compared to recent seasons, but the reasons for those declines likely go beyond Trump, according to The Sporting News and The Atlantic. How long will the Trump voters hang onto their newly found negative views of the NFL? Perhaps all will be forgiven if their former favorite teams make the NFL playoffs. But they might just come around anyway. Quealy notes that negative views of United Airlines that spiked after videos of a passenger being dragged off an airplane went viral already have returned to near normal levels.","label":0}

As for Donald Trump being used by Vladimir Putin, I will buy that he has some sort of financial ties going on, but the idea that Russia helped him get elected is not a viable talking point and continues to be debunked as nothing short of a neo-McCarthyist attempt by neo-liberal conservatives to distract the public from their own corruption. Even Bernie Sanders got caught misrepresenting the facts on this. He told Chris Cuomo earlier this year that he had seen overwhelming evidence that Russia tampered with our election. Late last month, Glenn Greenwald posted an article on The Intercept showing how false that information was and how thoroughly that narrative has been debunked.

Charlotte Observer In this week's \"sign that the Apocalypse might be upon us,\" a woman was arrested partially for letting her 11-year-old drive a golf cart that she and her husband were sitting in. What a world. Julie Mall of North Carolina was on vacation with her family at Bald Head Island when she let her 11-year-old son drive the cart (full of adults) back to their rented house. This is illegal on Bald Head Island because carts are the only way to get around with cars not allowed. According to the Charlotte Observer, Mall admitted her wrongdoing.  Mall says there is no question she was wrong. You must be 16 and have a valid drivers' license to drive a golf cart on Bald Head Island. There have been fatal accidents there from people falling out of carts.  But then it got weird. \"Immediately [the officer who stopped us] started berating us,\" she told the Observer. \"He was saying 'How old is this kid?' 'Are you guys drunk?' 'I could write you up for child abuse.' \" That seems weird. Mall's response was understandable.  Mall says after the sobbing children left, she told the officer she was angry that he had upset them unnecessarily. \"I said, 'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' and I stuck my finger in his face.\"  Then it got really weird. Mall's husband left the group after the kids left and Julie was stuck with multiple officers. When her husband came back, she was on the ground (see disturbing video footage below).

{"text":"Video: Alt-right protester choked out for waving meme signs at Sam Houston monument protest: The protester was waving signs containing popular alt-right memes, such as Pepe the Frog before being attacked A bystander video appears to show an armed man place a demonstrator with Nazi symbols in a choke hold at Saturday's gathering to support the statue of Sam Houston in the city's Hermann Park after apparently fake calls for its removal because Houston owned slaves. The video, which appears to show a choke hold lasting about five seconds, was posted to YouTube by an apparent anti-Semitic account supportive of the \"alt-right,\" a loose political affiliation that often blends racism, white nationalism and populism. The person who posted the video labeled the altercation as \"Latino Oath Keeper Chokes Alt-Right White Nationalist In Houston Texas.\" (WARNING: Video contains graphic language.) The man who was choked had been carrying a megaphone, signs with alt-right images such as \"Pepe the Frog\" and a flag that combined elements of the American flag with Nazi symbols such as the sonnenrad, which the Anti-Defamation League says was used by Adolf Hitler's Nazi party as well his stomtroopers in the SA and SS. Today the symbol is popular with white supremacists, according to the ADL, an anti-hate organization founded in 1913. In the seconds before the altercation, he defended his presence against a gathering angry crowd. \"These are good memes,\" he said, holding up his signs that featured \"Pepe the Frog\" imagery as well as a Star of David. \" Dude, this is not Comicon,\" another man yelled, referring to a convention of comics-lovers. \"I know, what is it?\" the alt-right supporter asked rhetorically. \"I thought I was just coming to make friends.\" SAM HOUSTON PROTEST: Gun-carrying protesters, some waving Confederate flags, rally in Hermann Park The account that posted the video labeled the man who choked the alt-right supporter as an Oath Keeper. The Oath Keepers - whose members often show up heavily armed at tense protests, purportedly to prevent dictatorship - is \"one of the largest radical antigovernment groups in the U.S. today,\" according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks radical groups. The alt-right supporter soon was escorted out of the demonstration, walking toward the police line as demonstrators chanted, \"Na, na, na, na. Hey, hey, hey. Goodbye.\" The Houston Police Department did not make any arrests or issue any citations at the protest, spokesman Victor Senties said Monday. Police were not aware of the altercation until a reporter asked about the video Monday. \"We were not made aware of the choke hold incident,\" Senties said. Officers met the man at the police line as he was escorted out, but the man did not mention an assault or ask to file a complaint. If the victim wanted, police could start an investigation that ultimately could lead to criminal charges, but the spokesman said that can only happen with the victim's cooperation. \"You've got to have a complainant,\" he said. There was a heavy police presence throughout the event, the Chronicle previously reported. Hundreds of protesters, some of them armed, gathered at Hermann Park Saturday to defend Sam Houston. Carrying Texas and Confederate flags, participants seem concerned that the Sam Houston statue at the park might be removed since the historical figure owned slaves. Media: Chron.com \"We work very closely with organizers regardless of what the issue may be, no matter what their objectives are,\" Chief Art Acevedo said Saturday at the demonstration. \"We want to make sure that people work with us and we work with them and let them accomplish their goal, which is to express their views.\" Carrying Texas and Confederate flags, participants seemed concerned the park's Sam Houston statue might be removed because the historical figure owned slaves. \"Erasing history for the sake of political correctness or to make somebody feel better, it's not just stupid \u2014 it's dangerous,\" said David Amad, an organizer of the demonstration. The group wants others to understand Sam Houston's contribution to Texas history. The demonstration was organized after rumors spread that a group called Texas Antifa was planning to show up to advocate removing the statue from the park. READ MORE: It's easy to take down a statue.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)Colin Kaepernick sparked a media firestorm on August 26 when he refused to stand for the national anthem before a preseason game against the Green Bay Packers. The San Francisco 49ers quarterback explained in an interview, \"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\" I immediately applauded Kaepernick for using the art of protest to spark a national dialogue. People are dying. We are in the eye of a cultural crisis in America. NBA great calls Kaepernick's protest \"patriotic\" 05:58 Kaepernick put endorsements at risk and clearly angered many. Some complained he was anti-American. On the contrary, I thought his action was pro-American, following in the tradition of Muhammad Ali, Tommie Smith and John Carlos. Protest is an American right, which Colin peacefully exercised. But here is where Kaepernick lost me: His remarks to the press segued into a rant of the type you hear from the conservative right. He said: \"I mean, you have Hillary who's called black teens or black kids super predators. You have Donald Trump who's openly racist. I mean, we have a presidential candidate [Hillary Clinton] who's deleted emails and done things illegally and is a presidential candidate. That doesn't make sense to me, because if that was any other person, you'd be in prison.\" To lump Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the same category is wrong, offensive and uninformed. Trump isn't even in the same category as former President George W. Bush or former Vice President Dick Cheney. Donald Trump isn't a Republican or even a conservative. He's a rich, famous alleged businessman who has money to burn and a disturbing case of narcissism. It's irresponsible for Kaepernick to insinuate that Clinton should be in jail, with words that skirt close to the shouts of \"Lock her up!\" from the crowd during Gov. Chris Christie's remarks at the Republican National Convention. After months of investigations into whether charges should be brought against Clinton for her use of a private email server, the FBI director James B. Comey said, \"Our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.\" Mother of fallen hero to 49ers QB: Sitting down \"easy\" 06:10 I believe the FBI knows more about Clinton's emails than Kaepernick. [Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article included the sentence \"We should trust the FBI,\" which the writer had not intended to include.] In addition, Clinton has owned her mistakes. Donald Trump owns nothing; he believes he is flawless, appearing to make grudging concessions of regret (only once) as a feint when bringing on a new team to revive his campaign. I have been critical of many of Hillary Clinton's positions. However, she knows she is not above critique. During the primaries, she was protested by Black Lives Matter. Her response? She didn't encourage violence and then offer to pay medical bills for people who threw punches, like Trump; she met with representatives of Black Lives Matter.  From the start of her campaign, she has offered a detailed plan on criminal justice reform. And while some people accuse her of pandering when she talks to any African-American, there is much evidence to the contrary. Clinton has repeatedly reached out to the black community. She has spoken to black media outlets and talked about African-American issues to African-American audiences. Trump's pitch to African-Americans? \"You're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed -- what the hell do you have to lose?\" Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Photos: The civil rights movement in photos Kaepernick referenced her 1996 comment \"super predators.\" Sadly, he quoted her as falsely as Donald Trump did. She didn't specifically call black teens or black kids super predators. She was referencing gang culture, but many interpreted the term as racially coded language. I agree, and I despised the term. Nonetheless, Clinton apologized for the words she used 20 years ago that didn't receive mainstream press until she was running for President. Trump won't even directly apologize for an insulting or bigoted comment he made a week ago.  Additionally, African-Americans have held the Clintons accountable for years. It's a myth that African-Americans blindly supported the Clintons. In 1996, African-American turnout bottomed at only 53%, the lowest it had been since President Jimmy Carter in 1976. The African-American community is not a robotic voting bloc. Cornel West, Michelle Alexander, Marc Lamont Hill, Melissa Harris-Perry and other thought leaders have been deeply critical of Hillary, but with nuance. Hillary Clinton has worked for the black vote. Colin Kaepernick, I want to tell you something: I am a black man who lives in a black and predominately immigrant neighborhood. I, my friends, my family and my neighbors cannot afford a Trump presidency. Our very being would be at risk -- on issues from health care to immigration, to the right to marry to the makeup of the Supreme Court and all that would portend. Hughley: There's nothing more American than silence 01:26 Although Kaepernick is a person of color and has experienced prejudice, he sits in a space of economic privilege -- a man who signed a multimillion dollar contract in 2014. Yes, he is entitled to his opinion, as am I. But is he seriously claiming Trump and Clinton are the same? Trump has said things that I've never heard from a Republican nominee in my lifetime. This is not a standard election. The safety and morale of our country are at stake. It takes time to grow into activism. There is space for him to evolve and learn. His intentions were clearly genuine. While Kaepernick sitting during the national anthem was profound, his words about the Democratic nominee were disappointing and, quite frankly, misguided. Colin, your voice is needed. Please don't encourage anyone to bench their vote. We cannot let Trump become president. This is not the football field. This is not a game. You are blessed to live in a world where your livelihood is protected, but for the rest of us, we can't endure a President Trump.","label":1}
{"text":"5 Reasons White Supremacists Are The Dumbest Weirdos On Earth: 1. They define themselves with the flags of losers White supremacists tend to use two flags as the defining symbols of their movement: the flag of Nazi Germany and the Confederate flag (YES I KNOW IT'S TECHNICALLY \"THE BATTLE FLAG OF THE ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA\" BUT LITERALLY EVERYONE ASSOCIATES IT AS THE FLAG OF THE CONFEDERACY SO GET OVER IT). What do these flags have in common, besides symmetrical designs and WAY too much red? Easy. They're the flags of LOSERS. In an incredibly bizarre turn of events, white supremacists have decided that the flags of two of history's most famously abject losers are the kind of iconography they wanna attach themselves to. Sure, both the Confederacy and Nazi Germany had super-racist belief systems at their very foundations, but they're also notable for getting BRUTALLY beaten because they both sucked ass pretty bad. White supremacists associating themselves with shitty losers? Who could have seen THAT coming? 2. Their heroes prove there's nothing \"supreme\" about their (or anyone's) race It's kinda nuts to imagine that the greatest historical leader of the white supremacist movement is Adolf Hitler, a man who famously tested out cyanide pills on HIS DOG because he wanted to make sure they worked and didn't want to suffer too much when committing suicide. Hitler, for all of his powerful oratory and bluster, was a weak little wimp (and couldn't even grow a decent full mustache) who sucked at painting and who pulled shitty pranks and farted all the time. Also, he looked like an insurance salesman with a bad combover, so that should make everyone question his whole \"master race\" theory on genetics. Who else are their heroic leaders? Richard Spencer, the guy currently famous for constantly getting punched and fleeing? David Duke, the former head of the KKK who wrote a book under a female pseudonym explaining how to give blowjobs and receive anal sex? Steve Bannon, the lumpy failed screenwriter who is currently being outflanked politically by Jared Kushner? Every hero the white supremacist movement has holds one thing in common: they're utter failures as human beings (even discounting their inherently detestable belief systems) who are also largely ugly as hell. Seriously, how can you honestly say your race is genetically-superior when your hero looks like this? \"Genetically superior\" people looking like waterlogged bloated corpses is a weird interpretation of the word \"superior.\" 3. Their most famous heroes are ALSO ridiculous hypocrites Strom Thurmond holds a special place in the hearts of white supremacists for several reasons - his virulent campaign against the civil rights movement, his longstanding record of the longest congressional filibuster in opposition of ending segregation, and for being a hilarious hypocritical racist (okay they probably weren't a fan of this last bit). Yep - Strom Thurmond, infamous racist \/ terrifying zombie senator, famously fathered Essie Mae Washington-Williams...the daughter of a black woman who worked for his parents (and who was only 16 at the time). So not only was Thurmond espousing racist views and policies to denigrate African-Americans nonstop, but he was sleeping with and impregnating an (underage) African-American at the same time. And in case you're looking for a more modern example (given there is nothing less modern than Strom Thurmond), look no further than Mike Enoch - the pseudonym of a popular alt-right podcaster and blogger who regularly espoused insanely racist, neo-Nazi beliefs - the usual mix of anti-Muslim, anti-African-American, and anti-Semitism... until it was revealed his wife was Jewish. That's the thing about these people - they espouse hatred and ignorance and use their positions of influence in the worst possible manner, and they're NOT EVEN GOOD AT BEING RACIST. 4. All of their beliefs are based on gibberish and nonsense Here's the thing: \"race\" is a completely meaningless term. There is no such thing as a biological race - we are all humans and part of the same species, and literally everything else is minor aesthetic differences that ultimately mean nothing. This has been the position of scientists since the 1950s, and yet so many people are insistent that \"race\" is a meaningful way to judge others. Want to know how meaningless the idea of \"the white race\" is? What was considered \"white\" has been in fluctuation for as long as the term existed - it's pretty well known that in the earlier part of the 20th century, there was a good amount of racism coming from white supremacists against individuals of Italian and Irish descent. And even as of recently, white supremacists seem more welcoming to lighter-skinned people of Hispanic descent. The point is - it doesn't mean anything, except what racists WANT it to mean. And even if you were the type to think it meant something, ultimately each individual's ancestry is open to interpretation: if 86% of your ancestors were members of what you consider to be \"the white race,\" but 14% were of African descent, are you considered white? Well, we could just ask notorious white supremacist Craig Cobb, who discovered that was exactly his genetic mix. What it all boils down to is this: THE ENTIRE BASIS OF RACISM IS STUPID. Hell, ALL prejudice is stupid - to judge individuals or groups based on arbitrary categorizations and biases makes zero actual sense. Anyways, just thought we should get that one out of the way. 5. They get mad when you call them racist, even though they define themselves by racism Listen - if you're going to espouse beliefs that certain races are better than others and that certain races should be discriminated against, that makes you a racist. I'm not trying to be insulting, that's just the actual dictionary definition of \"racist.\" And yet, for some reason, people who are objectively racists get really mad when people refer to them as such: Source: Raw Story If you're a racist, at least OWN it a little.","label":1}
{"text":"Iran nuclear deal an unfolding disaster: Marco Rubio represents Florida in the United States Senate and is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The views expressed are his own. (CNN)When it comes to President Barack Obama's disastrous nuclear deal with Iran, it has become difficult to keep track of the troubling new revelations that seem to surface almost daily. Outrageous, potentially illegal, actions by this administration have become so commonplace that many Americans have become numb to the recent news regarding this President's policy toward Iran. We now know the President authorized a $1.7 billion cash ransom payment to Iran, then his administration lied about it to Congress. Only President Barack Obama and supporters of the Iran nuclear deal refuse to accept that the pallets of cash were a ransom payment, even though it was ransom by every definition of the word. This endangers every American overseas by incentivizing kidnappers and encouraging hostage-takers, and since Iran's release of five US hostages in January, multiple American citizens have been thrown into Iranian jail cells. Providing cash to Iran has also allowed the mullahs to circumvent the international financial system as they shuttle much-needed resources to their terrorist proxies in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. We recently learned President Obama dismantled a key part of the ballistic missile sanctions against Iran eight years early. But this past July, the President praised his Iran deal, saying, \"We are not taking the pressure off Iran ... with respect to ballistic missiles. As I just explained ... we maintain the eight years on the ballistic missiles under this particular UN resolution. ... So we have not lost those legal authorities.\" Once again, the White House lied to the American people about its concessions to the Iranian regime. The facts are clear. The entity in question is the only Iranian bank designated by the United Nations for providing support to Iran's main ballistic missile-related organizations, and was described by the Treasury Department as \"the financial linchpin of Iran's missile procurement network.\" Ballistic missiles were not supposed to be a part of President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran, but they became one simply because he negotiated from a position of weakness. He wanted a deal so badly and at any cost that he let Tehran name their terms. Just this month, the Obama administration announced Iran will be allowed to conduct US dollar transactions, making it easier for Iranians involved in terrorism to do business. Having the world see an American president bend over backward to secure such a terrible deal has had far-reaching consequences that go well beyond Iran's nuclear program. Before the deal was finalized, President Obama expressed hope that signing it would strengthen moderate forces inside Iran. Nothing of the sort has occurred, as Iran has grown more emboldened by the administration's efforts to protect the deal whether Iran complies or not. This is most obvious in the chaos and destruction Iran is sowing across the Middle East. Iran has continued to develop ballistic missiles, a direct threat to our allies in the region, especially Israel. Earlier this year, Iran launched two missiles, one inscribed with \"Israel must be wiped out\" in Hebrew, according to Iranian officials, and this summer Iran reportedly attempted to launch a modified North Korean missile with a maximum range of 2,500 miles. Iran has also maintained its support of Hezbollah, a terrorist organization that has destabilized the government in Lebanon and is working with Russia and Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. A senior Iranian official has also stated that Tehran has been providing intelligence to Russia for military targeting, helping Moscow support Assad and his slaughter of innocent Syrians. Russia was also responsible for airstrikes on a UN humanitarian convoy and for decimating Aleppo, formerly Syria's largest city. This ongoing humanitarian disaster is heart-wrenching, and unlike anything the world has seen in decades. In Yemen, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels continue to prolong a conflict that has no end in sight. Before the nuclear deal was finalized, Secretary of State John Kerry said in April 2015 that Iran was providing military support to the Houthis. There is evidence Iran continues to provide that supportand that the Houthis have directly benefited from Tehran's windfall from the nuclear deal. In recent days, the Houthis fired missiles at US Navy ships on multiple occasions. However, even as American sailors are attacked by an Iranian proxy, potentially using Iranian-provided weapons, the administration pretends none of this is happening, and is reluctant to condemn Iran publicly. Despite all this, President Obama naively claims the Iran deal is a success. But with each passing day, it becomes more painfully obvious that this deal has made our country less secure, and the U.S. taxpayer money President Obama gave to Iran is being used to support terrorism and help in the killing of thousands of innocent people in Syria and elsewhere. Those who support this disastrous nuclear deal should be haunted daily by these facts.","label":1}
{"text":"Trump Just Attacked The DOJ, Gets His A** Handed To Him By Sally Yates (TWEET): Donald Trump dropped several shocking statements in his outrageous interview with The New York Times yesterday, and his comments about the Department of Justice were some of the worst parts of it. In the interview, Trump clearly stated that if he\u2019d known Attorney General Jeff Sessions was going to recuse himself from overseeing the Russian investigation, he never would have nominated the former Alabama senator. Trump also warned Special Counsel Robert Mueller against investigating his family\u2019s financial matters. These statements are shocking and extremely unpresidential, but unfortunately we\u2019ve come to expect this from Trump and his highly flawed administration. But one person, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, isn\u2019t going to let this slide. Having experienced Trump\u2019s wrath firsthand when she was fired by him several months ago for getting in the way of the infamous Muslim travel ban, Yates has been an outspoken opponent of Trump and has been giving him hell ever since. Celebrities Then and Now Ad Photo gallery of celebrities then and now! Stanton Daily View Now In a brutal message posted on Twitter, Yates trashed Trump for attacking a \u201cbedrock principle of our democracy\u201d with his disrespectful comments about the Department of Justice. She wrote:  \u201cPOTUS attack on Russia recusal reveals yet again his violation of the essential independence of DOJ, a bedrock principle of our democracy.\u201d  While Trump still seems to think he can fire everyone who poses a threat to him, Yates is the perfect example that just because Trump strips people of their power and positions, he can\u2019t get them to shut up and stop exposing him. Yates has become a highly respected figure after she was responsible for shutting down Trump\u2019s Muslim ban, and the American people play attention to what she says. If Trump thought he could make her fade into the background by taking away her job, Yates has just proved him very, VERY wrong.
